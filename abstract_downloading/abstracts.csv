(Th)1/Th2 related cytokines, and the expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 
(TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) 
of nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis (AR) rats, so as to explore its mechanism 
underlying improvement of AR.
METHODS: Thirty-two SD rats were randomly divided into normal, model, 
non-acupoint injection and acupoint injection groups (n=8 in each group). The AR 
model was established by ovalbumin sensitization. In the acupoint injection 
group, ""Yintang"" (GV24+) and bilateral ""Yingxiang"" (LI20) were selected for 
injection of mixture solution of dexamethasone and lidocaine (0.05 mL/acupoint), 
once every 4 days for a total of 4 times. The non-acupoints, located at the 
midpoint between the ""Houhai"" and ""Huantiao"" (GB30) on the bilateral hips and 
the sites 5 cm inferior to the axillary were injected with the same dose of 
mixture solution as that in the acupoint injection group. The AR severity was 
assessed by cumulative quantification scoring methods (including the numbers of 
nose-catching and sneezes, and the amount of nasal secretions in 30 min). The 
pathological changes of nasal mucosa were observed by HE staining. The contents 
of immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ in serum 
were detected by ELISA. The expressions of TLR4 and MyD88 in nasal mucosa was 
detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of AP-1 in nasal mucosa was 
detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: Following modeling, the AR symptom score, serum IgE and IL-4 contents 
and expression of TLR4, MyD88 and AP-1 of nasal mucosa were significantly 
increased in the model group than those in the normal group (P<0.01), while the 
serum IFN-γ content was significantly decreased (P<0.01). Compared with the 
model group and non-acupoint injection group, the AR symptom score, the serum 
contents of IgE and IL-4 and the expressions of TLR4, MyD88 and AP-1 in nasal 
mucosa were significantly decreased in the acupoint injection group (P<0.01, 
P<0.05), while the serum IFN-γ content was significantly increased (P<0.01). 
H.E. staining of the nasal mucosa showed that most of the epithelium fell off, 
the lamina propria vessels expanded, the glands proliferated, and eosinophils 
and lymphocytes infiltrated in the model and non-acupoint injection groups, and 
those were significantly improved in the acupoint injection group.
CONCLUSION: Acupoint injection can effectively improve allergic inflammation of 
the nose in AR rats, which may be related with its function in inhibiting the 
abnormal activation of TLR4/AP-1 signaling pathway and regulating the imbalance 
of Th1/Th2.","Publisher:

pediatric hospitalization, and some develop severe pneumonias requiring 
pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission and mechanical ventilation (MV). 
The aim of this study is to investigate the value of peripheral blood (PB) 
parameters available on admission in predicting the need for PICU admission and 
MV due to pneumonia caused by hPIVs. A total of 331 cases including 277 (83.69%) 
on the general ward (GW) and 54 (16.31%) on the PICU were enrolled between 
January 2016 and June 2021. Of 54 patients admitted to the PICU, 24 patients 
(7.25%) received MV, whereas 30 (9.06%) did not. For both the PICU and GW 
groups, infants accounted for the highest proportion while school children had 
the lowest. Compared with the GW group, the PICU group had significantly higher 
rates of premature birth, fatigue, sore throat, headache, chest pain, tachypnea, 
dyspnea, and underlying diseases including congenital tracheal stenosis, 
congenital heart disease (CHD), metabolic disorder, and neurological disorder 
(ND), but significant lower proportion of exclusive breastfeeding and Z-scores 
for weight-for-height, weight-for-age, height-for-age, and body-mass-index 
(BMI)-for-age (BMIZ). Higher levels of some leukocyte differential counts 
(LDC)-related parameters including counts of neutrophil (N), ratios of 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophils/(leukocytes minus 
neutrophils) ratio (dNLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lower levels 
of some other LDC-related parameters including lymphocyte (L) and monocyte (M) 
counts, ratios of lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), lymphocyte-to-C-reactive 
protein ratio, and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and lower levels of PB 
protein (PBP)-related parameters including red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin, 
total protein (TP), and serum albumin were observed in the PB of patients in the 
PICU compared with those in the GW. Notably, higher PLR level and two 
comorbidities including CHD and ND were identified as independent risk factors 
for PICU admission, while lower PNI level as well as smaller numbers of RBC and 
L as good predictors. Low levels of TP might be a useful predictor of the need 
for MV. Overall, the relative contributions of LDC- and PBP-related factors for 
accurate identification of patients required PICU admission accounted for 53.69% 
and 46.31%, respectively. Thus, determination of whether a patient with 
hPIVs-induced pneumonia is admitted to PICU involves consideration of both the 
LDC- and PBP-related parameters.",© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/jmv.28752

macrophage (TAM) induction of CD8+T cells into a terminally exhausted state has 
been implicated as a major mechanism of immunotherapy resistance, but a deeper 
biological understanding is necessary.
METHODS: Primary ccRCC tumor samples were obtained from 97 patients between 2004 
and 2018. Multiplex immunofluorescence using lymphoid and myeloid markers was 
performed in seven regions of interest per patient across three predefined 
zones, and geospatial analysis was performed using Ripley's K analysis, a 
methodology adapted from ecology.
RESULTS: Clustering of CD163+M2 like TAMs into the stromal compartment at the 
tumor-stroma interface was associated with worse clinical stage 
(tumor/CD163+nK(75): stage I/II: 4.4 (IQR -0.5 to 5.1); stage III: 1.4 (IQR -0.3 
to 3.5); stage IV: 0.6 (IQR -2.1 to 2.1); p=0.04 between stage I/II and stage 
IV), and worse overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) 
(tumor/CD163+nK(75): median OS-hi=149 months, lo=86 months, false-discovery rate 
(FDR)-adj. Cox p<0.001; median CSS-hi=174 months, lo=85 months; FDR-adj. Cox 
p<0.001). An RNA-seq differential gene expression score was developed using this 
geospatial metric, and was externally validated in multiple independent cohorts 
of patients with ccRCC including: TCGA KIRC, and the IMmotion151, IMmotion150, 
and JAVELIN Renal 101 clinical trials. In addition, this CD163+ geospatial 
pattern was found to be associated with a higher TIM-3+ proportion of 
CD8+T cells, indicative of terminal exhaustion (tumor-core: 0.07 (IQR 0.04-0.14) 
vs 0.40 (IQR 0.15-0.66), p=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Geospatial clustering of CD163+M2 like TAMs into the stromal 
compartment at the tumor-stromal interface was associated with poor clinical 
outcomes and CD8+T cell terminal exhaustion.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Maternal and Child Health Care 
Hospital, Beijing, China.","BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have reported that controlling nutritional 
(CONUT) status scores, incorporating total cholesterol (TC) and serum albumin 
(SA) values, and total lymphocyte (LY) counts, are reliable malignant tumor 
predictors. However, CONUT scores for predicting endometrial cancer (EC) remain 
unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate preoperative CONUT scores as prognostic factors for 
postoperative EC.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated preoperative CONUT scores in 785 
surgically resected EC patients at our hospital between June 2012 and May 2016. 
Using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, patients 
were split into: 1) CONUT-high (CH) (≥1) and 2) CONUT-low (CL) (<1) groups. 
Relationships between CONUT scores and different clinicopathological, 
pathological differentiation, muscle layer infiltration depth, and prognosis 
factors were examined, and Cox regression analyses performed to assess 
prognostic values on overall survival (OS) rates.
RESULTS: We assigned 404 (51.5%) and 381 (58.5%) patients to CH and CL groups, 
respectively. In the CH group, body mass index (BMI), prognostic nutrition index 
(PNI), and LY/monocyte ratios (LMR) were decreased, however, neutrophil/LY (NLR) 
and platelet/LY ratios (PLR) were increased. Pathological differentiation 
analyses showed that G1 proportions were higher in the CL group, while G2 and G3 
proportions were more prevalent in the CH group. Muscle layer infiltration depth 
in CL patients was < 50%, while that it was ≥50% in the CH group. No significant 
differences in OS rates were recorded between CH and CL groups over 60 months. 
However long-term survival (LTS) rates after 60 months in the CH group were 
significantly lower when compared with the CL group, and was more obvious in 
type II EC patients. Also, periuterine infiltration and preoperative CONUT 
scores were independent prognostic factors for OS rates as indicated by 
multi-factor analyses.
CONCLUSION: CONUT scores not only facilitated the estimation of nutritional 
status, but were highly beneficial for predicting OS rates in patients with EC 
after curative resection. CONUT scores provided high predictive values for LTS 
rates over 60 months in these patients.","Copyright © 2023 Yuan, Wang, Cheng, Wang and Zhang.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1126576

and poor prognosis after 125I particle therapy for differentiated thyroid 
cancer.
METHODS: A total of 104 patients with differentiated TC who were treated with 
125I particles during January 2020 to January 2021 was picked. These subjects 
were graded as low-dose group (80Gy-110Gy) and high-dose group (110Gy-140Gy) 
according to the minimum dose received by 90% of the target volume (D90) after 
surgery. The tumor volume before and after treatment was compared, and fasting 
venous blood was collected before and after treatment. The content of 
thyroglobulin (Tg) was detected by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The 
levels of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), lymphocytes, neutrophils, and 
monocytes were detected on automatic blood cell analyzer. The lymphocyte to 
monocyte ratio (LMR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to 
lymphocyte ration (PLR) were calculated. The changes in the condition of 
patients were closely observed, and the occurrence of adverse reactions in the 
two groups were compared. The risk factors influencing the efficacy of 125I 
particle therapy for differentiated TC were analyzed through multivariate 
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The total effective rate of patients in the low- and high-dose groups 
was 78.85% and 82.69%, respectively (P > 0.05). Compared with the pretreatment 
period, the tumor volume and Tg level in both groups were much lower (P < 0.05), 
and the differences in tumor volume and Tg level had no statistically 
significant difference between the two groups before and after treatment (P > 
0.05). At 1 week of the treatment, the total incidence of adverse reactions such 
as nausea, radiation gastritis, radiation parotitis, and neck discomfort was 
obviously higher in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group (P < 0.05). 
At 1 month of treatment, the incidence of adverse reactions such as nausea was 
markedly higher in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group (P < 0.05). 
After treatment, serum NLR and PLR contents were memorably elevated and LMR 
level was sharply decreased in both groups, and serum NLR and PLR contents were 
higher and LMR content was lower in the high-dose group than in the low-dose 
group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the 
pathological type of follicular adenocarcinoma, tumor size ≥ 2 cm, clinical 
stage of III~IV, distant metastasis, and high TSH level before 125I particle 
treatment were all risk factors related to the efficacy of 125I particle 
treatment of TC (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of low-dose and high-dose 125I particles in the 
treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer is comparable, among which low-dose 
125I particles have fewer adverse effects and have less impact on the immunity 
of the body, which is well tolerated by patients and can be widely used in 
clinical practice. In addition, the pathological type of follicular 
adenocarcinoma, tumor size ≥ 2 cm, clinical stage III~IV, distant metastasis, 
and high TSH level before 125I particle treatment are all risk factors that 
affect the poor effect of 125I particles on thyroid cancer treatment, and early 
monitoring of the above index changes can help evaluate the prognosis.",Copyright © 2023 Liling Tan et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/8130422

With the aim to select patients who benefit from this new treatment and to find 
a marker for therapy monitoring, we investigated the cellular composition of 
nasal mucous membranes and inflammatory cells of patients suffering from CRSwNP 
and undergoing Dupilumab therapy using non-invasive nasal swab cytology.
METHODS: Twenty CRSwNP patients with the indication for Dupilumab therapy have 
been included in this prospective clinical study. In total, five study visits 
were conducted with ambulatory nasal differential cytology using nasal swabs 
starting with the beginning of therapy and followed by visits every 3 months for 
12 months. First, these cytology samples were stained with the 
May-Grunwald-Giemsa method (MGG) and the percentage of ciliated cells, mucinous 
cells, eosinophil cells, neutrophil cells, and lymphocytes was analyzed. 
Secondly, an immunocytochemical (ICC) ECP-staining was performed to detect 
eosinophil granulocytes. Additionally, during each study visit the nasal polyp 
score, SNOT20 questionnaire, olfactometry, the total IgE concentration in 
peripheral blood as well as the eosinophil cell count in peripheral blood were 
recorded. The change of parameters was evaluated over one year and the 
correlation between clinical effectiveness and nasal differential cytology was 
analyzed.
RESULTS: In both MGG (p<0.0001) and ICC analysis (p<0.001) a significant 
decrease of eosinophils was seen under Dupilumab treatment. When patients were 
divided into a Eo-low- (<21%) and Eo-high- (≥21%) group according to the 
percentage eosinophils in nasal swab catology in the first study visit, the 
Eo-high-group showed a greater change of eosinophils over time (Δ17.82) compared 
to the Eo-low-group (Δ10.67) but, however, no better response to therapy. The 
polyp score, SNOT20 questionnaire, and total IgE concentration in peripheral 
blood showed a significant decrease during the observation period (p<0.0001).
DISCUSSION: Nasal swab cytology as an easy-to-apply diagnostic method allows 
detection and quantification of the different cell populations within the nasal 
mucosa at a given time. The nasal differential cytology showed a significant 
decrease of eosinophils during Dupilumab therapy and can therefore be used as 
non-invasvive method for monitoring therapy success of this cost intensive 
therapy and potentially can allow an optimized individual therapy planning and 
management for CRSwNP patients. Since the validity of initial nasal swab 
eosinophil cell count as a predictive biomarker for therapy response was limited 
in our study, additional studies including larger number of participants will be 
necessary to further evaluate the potential benefits for clinical practice of 
this new diagnostic method.","Copyright © 2023 Danisman, Linxweiler, Kühn, Linxweiler, Solomayer, Wagner,

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Adenomyosis (AM) is a common benign uterine disorder that has 
deleterious effects on women's health. However, the pathogenesis of AM is not 
clearly understood. We aimed to investigate the pathophysiological changes and 
molecular mechanism in AM.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to construct a 
transcriptomic atlas of various cell subsets from the ectopic endometrium (EC) 
and eutopic endometrium (EM) of one AM patient and evaluate differential 
expression. The Cell Ranger software pipeline (version 4.0.0) was applied to 
conduct sample demultiplexing, barcode processing and mapping reads to the 
reference genome (human GRCh38). Different cell types were classified with 
markers with the ""FindAllMarkers"" function, and differential gene expression 
analysis was performed with Seurat software in R. The findings were confirmed by 
Reverse Transcription Real-Time PCR using samples from three AM patients.
RESULTS: We identified nine cell types: endothelial cells, epithelial cells, 
myoepithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, mast cells, 
macrophages and unknown cells. A number of differentially expressed genes, 
including CLO4A1, MMP1, TPM2 and CXCL8, were identified from all cell types. 
Functional enrichment showed that aberrant gene expression in fibroblasts and 
immune cells was related to fibrosis-associated terms, such as extracellular 
matrix dysregulation, focal adhesion and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. We also 
identified fibroblast subtypes and determined a potential developmental 
trajectory related to AM. In addition, we identified increased cell-cell 
communication patterns in EC, highlighting the imbalanced microenvironment in AM 
progression.
CONCLUSION: Our results support the theory of endometrial-myometrial interface 
disruption for AM, and repeated tissue injury and repair could lead to increased 
fibrosis in the endometrium. Therefore, the present study reveals the 
association between fibrosis, the microenvironment, and AM pathogenesis. This 
study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating AM progression.",© 2023 Niu et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/JIR.S402734

of the nasal mucosa in atopic individuals after allergen exposure. 
Alpha-linolenic acid [cis-9, cis-12, cis-15-octadecatrienoic acid (18:3)] (ALA) 
as dietary supplementation can reduce inflammation and allergic symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential therapeutic effect and mechanism of ALA in 
AR mouse model.
METHODS: Ovalbumin sensitized AR mouse model were challenged with oral ALA 
administration. Nasal symptoms, tissue pathology, immune cell infiltration and 
goblet cell hyperplasia were investigated. Levels of IgE, TNF-β, IFN-γ, IL-2, 
IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13 and IL-25 were determined by ELISA in serum and nasal 
fluid. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence were performed for occludin 
and zonula occludens-1 expression. CD3+CD4+ T-cells from peripheral blood and 
splenic lymphocytes were isolated and Th1/Th2 ratio were determined. Mouse naive 
CD4+ T cell were isolated and Th1/Th2 ratio, IL-4Rα expression, and IL5/IL13 
secretion were determined. IL-4Rα-JAK2-STAT3 pathway change in AR mice were 
performed by western blot.
RESULTS: Ovalbumin induced AR, nasal symptoms, pathological performance, IgE, 
and cytokine production. ALA treated mice showed reduced nasal symptoms, nasal 
inflammation, nasal septum thickening, goblet cell hyperplasia, and eosinophil 
infiltration. In serum and nasal fluid of ovalbumin challenged mice, ALA 
decreased IgE, IL-4 levels, and the increase of Th2-cells. ALA prevented the 
disruption of the epithelial cell barrier in ovalbumin-challenged AR mice. 
Simultaneously, ALA prevents IL-4 induced barrier disruption. ALA treatment of 
AR by affecting the differentiation stage of CD4+T cells and block

gain-of-function variant in the class IA PI3K catalytic subunit p110δ 
(responsible gene: PIK3CD) was described in 2013. The disease is characterized 
by recurrent airway infections and bronchiectasis. It is associated with 
hyper-IgM syndrome due to the defect of immunoglobulin class switch 
recombination and decreased CD27-positive memory B cells. Patients also suffered 
from immune dysregulations, such as lymphadenopathy, autoimmune cytopenia or 
enteropathy. T-cell dysfunction due to increased senescence is associated with a 
decrease in CD4-positive T lymphocytes and CD45RA-positive naive T lymphocytes, 
along with increased susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus/cytomegalovirus 
infections. In 2014, loss-of-function (LOF) mutation of p85α (responsible gene: 
PIK3R1), a regulatory subunit of p110δ, was identified as a causative gene, 
followed in 2016 by the identification of the LOF mutation of PTEN, which 
dephosphorylates PIP3, leading to the differentiation of APDS1 (PIK3CD-GOF), 
APDS2 (PIK3R1-LOF) and APDS-L (PTEN-LOF). Since the pathophysiology of patients 
with APDS varies with a wide range of severity, it is crucial that patients

(CTCL) and is characterized by epidermotrophism of malignant CD4+ T-lymphocytes. 
When MF advances to a recurrent stage, patients require treatment with systemic 
therapies such as vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. While vorinostat 
has been shown to exhibit anti-tumor activity in MF, its exact molecular 
mechanism has yet to be fully discerned. In the present study, we examined the 
transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of vorinostat treatment in two MF cell 
lines, Myla 2059 and HH. We find that vorinostat downregulates CTLA-4, CXCR4, 
and CCR7 in both cell lines, but its effect on several key pathways differs 
between the two MF cell lines. For example, vorinostat upregulates CCL5, CCR5, 
and CXCL10 expression in Myla cells but downregulates CCL5 and CXCL10 expression 
in HH cells. Furthermore, vorinostat upregulates IFN-γ and IL-23 signaling and 
downregulates IL-6, IL-7, and IL-15 signaling in Myla cells but does not affect 
these pathways in HH cells. Although Myla and HH represent established MF cell 
lines, their distinct tumor origin from separate patients demonstrates that 
inherent phenotypic variations within the disease persist, underscoring the 
importance of using a variety of MF cells in the preclinical development of MF 
therapeutics.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24098075

abnormal immune responses in the nervous system, causing inflammation and tissue 
damage. The interleukin (IL) family of cytokines, especially IL-1, IL-6, and 
IL-17, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. IL-1 is 
involved in the activation of immune cells, production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, and promotion of blood-brain barrier breakdown. IL-6 is essential for 
the differentiation of T cells into Th17 cells and has been implicated in the 
initiation and progression of neuroinflammation. IL-17 is a potent 
pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by Th17 cells that plays a crucial role in 
recruiting immune cells to sites of inflammation. This review summarizes the 
current understanding of the roles of different interleukins in autoimmune 
neuroinflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, neuromyelitis optica, and autoimmune 
encephalitis, and discusses the potential of targeting ILs as a therapeutic

from the cells lining the tubes of the kidney. The tumor immune microenvironment 
(TIME) of ccRCC is a complex interplay of various immune cells, cytokines, and 
signaling pathways. One of the critical features of the ccRCC TIME is the 
presence of infiltrating immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural 
killer cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Among these 
cells, CD8+ T cells are particularly important in controlling tumor growth by 
recognizing and killing cancer cells. However, the TIME of ccRCC is also 
characterized by an immunosuppressive environment that hinders the function of 
immune cells. Several mechanisms contribute to the immunosuppressive nature of 
the ccRCC TIME. For instance, ccRCC cells produce cytokines such as 
interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which 
suppress immune cell activation and promote the differentiation of regulatory T 
cells (Tregs). Tregs, in turn, dampen the activity of effector T cells and 
promote tumor growth. In addition, ccRCC cells can express programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which interacts with the programmed cell death protein 1 
(PD-1) receptor on T cells to inhibit their function. In addition, other immune 
checkpoint proteins, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 
(CTLA-4) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), also contribute to the 
immunosuppressive milieu of the ccRCC TIME. Finally, the hypoxic and 
nutrient-poor microenvironment of ccRCC can stimulate the production of 
immunosuppressive metabolites, such as adenosine and kynurenine, which further 
impair the function of immune cells. Understanding the complex interplay between 
tumor cells and the immune system in the ccRCC TIME is crucial for developing 
effective immunotherapies to treat this disease.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24097946

activation associated with HIV migration from reservoir sites. Statins are 
widely recommended as therapeutic agents to control ART-related CVD; however, 
their impacts on the cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count and viral load are 
inconsistent. To assess the effect of statins on markers of HIV infections, 
immune activation and cholesterol, we thoroughly reviewed evidence from 
randomised controlled trials. We found 20 relevant trials from three databases 
with 1802 people living with HIV (PLHIV) on statin-placebo treatment. Our 
evidence showed no significant effect on CD4 T-cell count standardised mean 
difference (SMD): (-0.59, 95% confidence intervals (CI): (-1.38, 0.19), p = 
0.14) following statin intervention in PLHIV on ART. We also found no 
significant difference in baseline CD4 T-cell count (SD: (-0.01, 95%CI: (-0.25, 
0.23), p = 0.95). Our findings revealed no significant association between 
statins and risk of viral rebound in PLHIV with undetectable viral load risk 
ratio (RR): (1.01, 95% CI: (0.98, 1.04), p = 0.65). Additionally, we found a 
significant increase in CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ T-cells (SMD (1.10, 95% CI: (0.93, 
1.28), p < 0.00001) and CD4+CD38+HLA-DR+ T-cells (SMD (0.92, 95% CI: (0.32,

total cholesterol (SMD: (-2.87, 95% CI: (-4.08, -1.65), p < 0.0001)). Our 
results suggest that the statin lipid-lowering effect in PLHIV on ART may 
elevate immune activation without influencing the viral load and CD4 count. 
However, due to the limited evidence synthesised in this meta-analysis, we 
recommend that future powered trials with sufficient sample sizes evaluate

and morphological features with embryonic blood and vascular precursor cells. 
Therefore, we suggest that VHL hemangioblastomas are derived from 
developmentally arrested hemangioblastic lineage keeping their potential of 
further differentiation. Due to these common features, it is of major interest 
to investigate whether VHL-associated tumors other than hemangioblastoma also 
share these pathways and molecular features. The expression of hemangioblast 
proteins has not yet been assessed in other VHL-related tumors. To gain a better 
understanding of VHL tumorigenesis, the expression of hemangioblastic proteins 
in different VHL-associated tumors was investigated. The expression of embryonic 
hemangioblast proteins Brachyury and TAL1 (T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 
protein 1) was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining on 75 VHL-related 
tumors of 51 patients: 47 hemangioblastomas, 13 clear cell renal cell 
carcinomas, 8 pheochromocytomas, 5 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and 2 
extra-adrenal paragangliomas. Brachyury and TAL1 expression was, respectively, 
observed in 26% and 93% of cerebellar hemangioblastomas, 55% and 95% of spinal 
hemangioblastomas, 23% and 92% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas, 38% and 88% 
of pheochromocytomas, 60% and 100% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and 50% 
and 100% of paragangliomas. We concluded that the expression of hemangioblast 
proteins in different VHL-associated tumors indicates a common embryological 
origin of these lesions. This may also explain the specific topographic 
distribution of VHL-associated tumors.","DOI: 10.3390/cancers15092551

cells that recirculate through secondary lymphoid organs or establish residence 
in tissues. In contrast to CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), the 
developmental origins and transcriptional regulation of CD4+ TRM remain largely 
undefined. Here, we investigated the phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional 
profiles of CD4+ TRM in the small intestine (SI) responding to acute viral 
infection, revealing a shared gene expression program and chromatin 
accessibility profile with circulating TH1 and the progressive acquisition of a 
mature TRM program. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified heterogeneity among 
established CD4+ TRM, which were predominantly located in the lamina propria, 
and revealed a population of cells that coexpressed both effector- and 
memory-associated genes, including the transcriptional regulators Blimp1, Id2, 
and Bcl6. TH1-associated Blimp1 and Id2 and TFH-associated Bcl6 were required 
for early TRM formation and development of a mature TRM population in the SI. 
These results demonstrate a developmental relationship between TH1 effector 
cells and the establishment of early TRM, as well as highlighted differences in 
CD4+ versus CD8+ TRM populations, providing insights into the mechanisms 
underlying the origins, differentiation, and persistence of CD4+ TRM in response

(NCAC) and complicated acute cholecystitis (CAC) preoperatively, which are two 
separate pathologies with different management. The aim of this study was to 
create an algorithm that distinguishes between CAC and NCAC using the decision 
tree method, which includes simple examinations. In this retrospective study, 
the patients were divided into 2 groups: CAC (149 patients) and NCAC (885 
patients). Parameters such as patient demographic data, American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Tokyo grade, comorbidity findings, white blood 
cell (WBC) count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, 
albumin level, CRP/albumin ratio (CAR), and gallbladder wall thickness (GBWT) 
were evaluated. In this algorithm, the CRP value became a very important 
parameter in the distinction between NCAC and CAC. Age was an important 
predictive factor in patients with CRP levels >57 mg/L, and the critical value 
for age was 42. After the age factor, the important parameters in the decision 
tree were WBC and GBWT. In patients with a CRP value of ≤57 mg/L, GBWT is 
decisive and the critical value is 4.85 mm. Age, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, 
and WBC count were among the other important factors after GBWT. Sex, ASA score, 
Tokyo grade, comorbidity, CAR, and albumin value did not have an effect on the 
distinction between NCAC and CAC. In statistical analysis, significant 
differences were found groups in terms of gender (34.8% vs 51.7% male), ASA 
score (P < .001), Tokyo grade (P < .001), comorbidity (P < .001), albumin (4 vs 
3.4 g/dL), and CAR (2.4 vs 38.4). By means of this algorithm, which includes 
low-cost examinations, NCAC and CAC distinction can be made easily and quickly 
within limited possibilities. Preoperative prediction of pathologies that are 
difficult to manage, such as CAC, can minimize patient morbidity and mortality.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000033749

an unexpected difference in nucleosome organization between enhancers and NRE: 
enhancers are located between nucleosomes, whereas NRE are occupied by 
nucleosomes in their endogenous locations. We also describe chromatin 
modification, eRNA production, and transcription factor binding at both 
enhancers and NREs. Our findings support the idea of silencer repurposing as

This study finds key genes linked to immunity in sepsis.
METHODS: The ""Limma package"" was used to analyze GSE154918 datasets for 
differentially expressed genes. The differentially expressed genes were then 
enriched for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, and 
interleukin 2 receptor subunit Beta (IL2RB) protein coding gene was chosen for 
investigation. IL2RB expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was 
assessed by polymerase chain reaction. White blood cells of septic patients and 
healthy controls were collected from hospitals and linked with acute physiology 
and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II, sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) of septic patients 
using Pearson's correlation analysis. PBMC cells were transfected with IL2RB, 
and the effect of transfection was observed on cellular interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-12, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17A.
RESULTS: A total of 686 differential genes, comprising 446 upregulated and 240 
down regulated genes, were identified. The enrichment of KEGG pathway revealed 
that the majority of differential genes were enriched in the T helper (Th1)/Th2 
cell and Th17 cell differentiation pathways. In patients with sepsis, 
correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between IL2RB and APACHE II 
score, SOFA score, CRP, and PCT. IFN-γ and IL-12 levels were elevated in PBMC of 
septic patients after IL2RB transfection, but IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17A levels 
were lowered.

also balances Th1/Th2 responses and prevents Th17 activation. © 2023 Codon

chronic and systemic inflammatory disease that leads to intestinal barrier 
dysfunction and autoimmunedisorders. However, the existing treatments of colitis 
are associated with poor outcomes, and the current strategies remain deep and 
long-time remission and the prevention of complications. Recently, 
demethyleneberberine (DMB) has been reported to be a potential candidate for the 
treatment of inflammatory response that relied on multiple pharmacological 
activities, including anti-oxidation and antiinflammation. However, the target 
and potential mechanism of DMB in inflammatory response have not been fully 
elucidated.
METHODS: This study employed a TNBS-induced colitis model and acute sepsis mice 
to screen and identify the potential targets and molecular mechanisms of DMB in 
vitro and in vivo. The purity and structure of DMB were quantitatively analyzed 
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry (MS), 
Hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), and infrared 
spectroscopy (IR), respectively. The rats were induced by a rubber hose inserted 
approximately 8 cm through their anus to be injected with TNBS. Acute sepsis was 
induced by injection with LPS via the tail vein for 60 h. These animals with 
inflammation were orally administrated with DMB, berberine (BBR), or curcumin 
(Curc), respectively. The eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression system of 
myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2) and its mutants were used to evaluate 
the target of DMB in inflammatory response.
RESLUTS: DMB had two free phenolic hydroxyl groups, and the purity exceeded 99% 
in HPLC. DMB alleviated colitis and suppressed the activation of TLR4 signaling 
in TNBS-induced colitis rats and LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. DMB significantly 
blocked TLR4 signaling in both an MyD88-dependent and an MyD88-independent 
manner by embedding into the hydrophobic pocket of the MD-2 protein with 
non-covalent bonding to phenylalanine at position 76 in a pi-pi T-shaped 
interaction. DMB rescued mice from sepsis shock induced by LPS through targeting 
the TLR4-MD-2 complex.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, DMB is a promising inhibitor of the MD-2 protein to 
suppress the hyperactivated TLR4 signaling in inflammatory response.","Copyright © 2023 Zhao, Liu, Luan, Jiang, Xu, Zhang, Zhang and Li.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1130404

or regulatory functions. Besides the well-established CD4+CD25hiCD127lo 
regulatory T cells (Tregs), we and others have shown that B cells can also have 
regulatory functions since their frequency and number are increased in kidney 
graft tolerance and B cell depletion as induction therapy may lead to acute 
rejection. On the other hand, we have shown that CD28-CD8+ T cells represent a 
subpopulation with potent effector/memory functions. In the current study, we 
tested the hypothesis that kidney allograft rejection may be linked to an 
imbalance of effector/memory and regulatory immune cells.
METHODS: Based on a large cohort of more than 1000 kidney graft biopsies with 
concomitant peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotyping, we investigated the 
association between kidney graft rejection and the percentage and absolute 
number of circulating B cells, Tregs, as well as the ratio of B cells to 
CD28-CD8+ T cells and the ratio of CD28-CD8+ T cells to Tregs. Kidney graft 
biopsies were interpreted according to the Banff classification and divided into 
5 biopsies groups: 1) normal/subnormal, 2) interstitial fibrosis and tubular 
atrophy grade 2/3 (IFTA), 3) antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), 4) T cell 
mediated-rejection (TCMR), and 5) borderline rejection. We compared group 1 with 
the other groups as well as with a combined group 3, 4, and 5 (rejection of all 
types) using multivariable linear mixed models.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found that compared to normal/subnormal biopsies, 
rejection of all types was marginally associated with a decrease in the 
percentage of circulating B cells (p=0.06) and significantly associated with an 
increase in the ratio of CD28-CD8+ T cells to Tregs (p=0.01). Moreover, ABMR, 
TCMR (p=0.007), and rejection of all types (p=0.0003) were significantly 
associated with a decrease in the ratio of B cells to CD28-CD8+ T cells compared 
to normal/subnormal biopsies. Taken together, our results show that kidney 
allograft rejection is associated with an imbalance between immune cells with 
effector/memory functions and those with regulatory properties.","Copyright © 2023 Mai, Degauque, Lorent, Rimbert, Renaudin, Danger, Kerleau,

patients with gastric cancer (GC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs), although the results are controversial. Therefore, we performed the 
present meta-analysis to systematically assess the correlation between NLR and 
prognosis and clinicopathological factors in GC patients undergoing treatment 
with ICIs. Among the electronic databases, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and 
Cochrane Library were thoroughly searched. To estimate the prognostic value of 
NLR for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), hazard ratios 
(HRs) were calculated, and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. This 
meta-analysis included 10 studies with 830 patients. Based on the pooled data, a 
high NLR was associated with poor OS in GC patients receiving ICIs (HR = 2.13, 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.70-2.66, p < 0.001). Elevated NLR was a 
significant biomarker for worse PFS in GC patients treated with ICIs (HR = 1.74, 
95% CI = 1.22-2.48, p = 0.002). There was, however, no significant correlation 
between NLR and sex, age, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance 
Status (PS) of the ECOG, differentiation, human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2 (HER2) status, or PD-L1 status in GC patients treated with ICIs. High NLR 
before treatment was associated with poor OS and PFS in GC patients treated with 
ICIs, according to our meta-analysis. NLR is an effective biomarker for 
evaluating the prognosis of GC patients receiving ICIs and provide more valuable 
information for treatment decisions in the era of immunotherapy for GC.","© 2023 The Authors. The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences published by John

survival and quality of life for patients. Much of the focus in the field has 
been on exploiting the power of the adaptive immune response through therapeutic 
targeting of T cells. While these approaches have markedly advanced the field, 
some challenges remain, and the clinical benefit of T cell therapies does not 
extend to all patients or tumor indications. Alternative strategies, such as 
engaging the innate immune system, have become an intense area of focus in the 
field. In particular, the engagement of natural killer (NK) cells as potent 
effectors of the innate immune response has emerged as a promising modality in 
immunotherapy. Here, we review therapeutic approaches for selective engagement 
of NK cells for cancer therapy, with a particular focus on targeting the key 
activating receptors NK Group 2D (NKG2D) and cluster of differentiation 16A

immune cell infiltration. Arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) can activate 
inflammatory responses and trigger various cell death patterns; however, the 
relevance of ALOX5 to immune cell infiltration in lung cancer is unclear. The 
expression of ALOX5 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is analyzed using an 
online database to explore the correlation between ALOX5 and immune cell 
infiltration in NSCLC and its relationship with prognosis.
METHODS: Differences in ALOX5 expression in NSCLC and normal lung tissues were 
analyzed by online databases such as TIMER, GEPIA and HPA; the UALCAN database 
was used to reveal the relationship between ALOX5 and clinical features; 
Kaplan-Meier database was applied to explore the prognostic value of ALOX5; 
GeneMANIA and String Website was used to explore genes and proteins associated 
with ALOX5 expression, respectively; the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were used to analyze ALOX5 
differential genes which were picked up through the TCGA database; GSEA software 
was applied to predict the signal pathways that ALOX5 may be involved in; and 
the TIMER database was used to analyze the effect of ALOX5 expression on the 
level of immune cell infiltration.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal lung tissues, the ALOX5 expression was low in 
NSCLC tissues (P<0.05), and which affected the prognosis of lung cancer 
patients. The expression level of ALOX5 was related to clinical features such as 
sex, age, metastasis, and pathological staging in NSCLC patients (all P<0.05). 
The gene interaction network analysis found that the genes interacting with 
ALOX5 mainly included the genes related to lipid oxidation and pro-inflammatory 
mediators such as coactosin like protein 1 (COTL1), leukotriene C4 synthase 
(LTC4S), and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and the 
protein-protein interaction analysis results were consistent. GO and KEGG 
analysis found that ALOX5 was involved in the biological process of activation 
of immune cell function and was involved in immune response function pathways. 
The GSEA analysis showed that ALOX5 may activate immune responses and mediate 
immune-related prognosis by affecting the cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interactions, natural killer-mediated cytotoxicity, and T cell receptor 
signaling pathways. The ALOX5 mRNA expressions in lung adenocarcinoma and lung 
squamous cell carcinoma were positively correlated with the tumor infiltration 
immune cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, etc.) (all P<0.05), and the 
ALOX5 mRNA expression was positively correlated with the expression of classic T 
cell immune checkpoint inhibitor genes (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ALOX5 gene expression in NSCLC is significantly downregulated, 
and which can affect NSCLC prognosis and immune cell infiltration levels. ALOX5 
gene may be a potential biomarker of NSCLC prognosis associated with immune cell 
infiltration.","Publisher: 目的: 肺癌免疫治疗疗效与免疫细胞浸润密切相关。花生四烯酸5-脂氧合酶5(arachidonic acid

mRNA表达与肿瘤浸润性免疫细胞(B细胞、CD8+T细胞、CD4+T细胞等)浸润水平均呈正相关(均P<0.05)，并且与经典的T细胞免疫检查点抑制剂基因标志物呈正相关(P<0.001)。结论: 
ALOX5基因在NSCLC中表达显著下调，可影响NSCLC预后和肿瘤免疫细胞浸润水平。ALOX5基因可能是潜在的与免疫细胞浸润相关的NSCLC预后生物标志物。.","DOI: 10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2023.220427

leukocytes, the abundance of microRNA, and the activity of the complement 
pathway in (1) colostrum following heat-treatment or freezing, and (2) 
colostrum, transition milk, and mature milk. In experiment 1, composite 
colostrum samples were harvested from individual cows (n = 14) on a commercial 
dairy farm in NY and split into 3 aliquots using single-use colostrum bags. One 
aliquot was immediately cooled on ice following harvest (RAW) and stored at 4°C 
overnight, one was heat-treated for 60 min at 60°C (HT) before being cooled on 
ice and stored at 4°C overnight, and one was frozen at -20°C overnight (FR). The 
following morning, all samples were warmed to 40°C before further processing. In 
experiment 2, cows were sampled in a longitudinal study where composite samples 
were collected from colostrum (first milking, n = 23), transition milk (3 to 4 d 
postpartum, n = 13), and mature milk (6 to 7 d postpartum, n = 13). In both 
experiments colostrum was harvested from the first milking within 8 h of calving 
and samples were processed within 14 h of collection. Colostral leukocytes were 
isolated before viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and manual 
differential cell counts were performed. Extracellular vesicles were isolated 
from whey by ultracentrifugation to isolate and quantify microRNA. Activity of 
the alternative complement pathway was determined in casein-depleted whey by 
semi-solid phase hemolysis assay. Somatic cell counts were determined for all 
raw samples. Macrophages and neutrophils made up the greatest proportion of 
leukocytes in colostrum followed by lymphocytes. Lymphocyte proportion increased 
as colostrum transitioned to mature milk, but overall somatic cell numbers 
declined concurrently. Viable cells were not isolated from HT or FR samples. 
Abundance of microRNA isolated from transition and mature milk was decreased 
compared with colostrum, did not differ between HT and RAW, but was increased in 
FR compared with RAW. Alternative complement pathway activity was decreased in 
HT, but not FR compared with RAW, and was not measurable in transition or mature 
milk. Postharvest heat-treatment and freezing of colostrum eliminated viable 
colostral leukocytes and affected microRNA abundance and complement activity. 
Leukocyte proportions, microRNA abundance, and complement activity changed as 
colostrum transitioned to mature milk. Although there were clear changes in the 
colostral components under study in relation to treatment and transition to 
mature milk, the biological significance of the described treatment effects and 
temporal changes were not investigated here.","The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. and Fass Inc. on behalf of the American

peripheral blood of patients with renal cell carcinoma. Patient-derived PBMCs

membrane lipid peroxide accumulation that plays a pathogenic role in several

distinguish active tuberculosis (ATB) from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) 
among children, however, remains to be analysed. Tuberculosis-related gene 
expression data and FRG lists were obtained, respectively, from Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) and FerrDb. Differentially expressed FRGs (DE-FRGs) detected when 
comparing samples from paediatric ATB and LTBI patients were explored using 
appropriate bioinformatics techniques, after which enrichment analyses were 
performed for these genes and hub genes were identified, with these genes then 
being used to explore potential drug interactions and construct competing 
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. The GSE39939 dataset yielded 124 DE-FRGs that 
were primarily related to responses to oxidative, chemical and extracellular 
stimulus-associated stress. In total, the LASSO and SVM-RFE algorithms enabled 
the identification of nine hub genes (MAPK14, EGLN2, IDO1, USP11, SCD, CBS, 
PARP8, PARP16, CDC25A) that exhibited good diagnostic utility. Functional 
enrichment analyses of these genes suggested that they may govern ATB transition 
from LTBI through the control of many pathways, including the immune response, 
DNA repair, transcription, RNA degradation, and glycan and energy metabolism 
pathways. The CIBERSORT algorithm suggested that these genes were positively 
correlated with inflammatory and myeloid cell activity while being negatively 
correlated with the activity of lymphocytes. A total of 50 candidate drugs 
targeting 6 hub DE-FRGs were also identified, and a ceRNA network was used to 
explore the complex interplay among these hub genes. The nine hub FRGs defined

occur in animals and humans as epidemiological analysis show, whereby the 
malignancy is permanently eliminated. We have developed a novel computational 
systems biology model for this unique phenomenon to furnish insight into the 
possibility of therapeutically replicating such regression processes on tumors 
clinically, without toxic side effects. We have formulated oncological 
informatics approach using cell-kinetics coupled differential equations while 
protecting normal tissue. We investigated three main tumor-lysis components: (ⅰ) 
DNA blockade factors, (ⅱ) Interleukin-2 (IL-2), and (ⅲ) Cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+ 
T). We studied the temporal variations of these factors, utilizing preclinical 
experimental investigations on malignant tumors, using mammalian melanoma 
microarray and histiocytoma immunochemical assessment. We found that permanent 
tumor regression can occur by: 1) Negative-Bias shift in population trajectory 
of tumor cells, eradicating them under first-order asymptotic kinetics, and 2) 
Temporal alteration in the three antitumor components (DNA replication-blockade, 
Antitumor T-lymphocyte, IL-2), which are respectively characterized by the 
following patterns: (a) Unimodal Inverted-U function, (b) Bimodal M-function, 
(c) Stationary-step function. These provide a time-wise orchestrated tri-phasic 
cytotoxic profile. We have also elucidated gene-expression levels corresponding 
to the above three components: (ⅰ) DNA-damage G2/M checkpoint regulation [genes: 
CDC2-CHEK], (ⅱ) Chemokine signaling: IL-2/15 [genes: IL2RG-IKT3], (ⅲ) 
T-lymphocyte signaling (genes: TRGV5-CD28). All three components quantitatively 
followed the same activation profiles predicted by our computational model 
(Smirnov-Kolmogorov statistical test satisfied, α = 5%). We have shown that the 
genes CASP7-GZMB are signatures of Negative-bias dynamics, enabling eradication 
of the residual tumor. Using the negative-biasing principle, we have furnished 
the dose-time profile of equivalent therapeutic agents (DNA-alkylator, IL-2, 
T-cell input) so that melanoma tumor may therapeutically undergo permanent

to the patient's pretransplant T-LGLL was first identified by T-cell receptor 
(TCR) PCR showing different sized fragments of rearranged gamma chains, in 
addition to shift from γδ to αβ TCR expression by flow cytometry analyses. 
Donor-derivation of the patient's post-transplant clonal lymphocytosis was 
confirmed by serial chimerism analyses of recipient's blood specimens 
demonstrating 100% donor DNA. Moreover, oncogenic DNMT3A and RUNX1 mutations 
were detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) only in post-transplant 
specimens. Intriguingly, despite continued increase in DNMT3A and RUNX1 mutation 
load, the patient's clonal lymphocytosis and anemia eventually largely resolved; 
yet, the observed mutation profile with persistent thrombocytopenia indicated 
secondary clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) in the absence of 
overt morphologic evidence of myeloid neoplasm in the marrow. This case 
illustrates the utility of longitudinal chimerism analysis and NGS testing 
combined with flow cytometric immunophenotyping to evaluate emerging 
donor-derived hematolymphoid processes and to properly interpret partial 
functional engraftment. It may also support the notion that driver 
mutation-induced microenvironmental changes may paradoxically contribute to 
reestablishing tissue homeostasis.",© 2023 El Hussein et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.,"DOI: 10.1101/mcs.a006241

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Hyper activation of the JAK-STAT signaling underlies the 
pathophysiology of many human immune-mediated diseases. Herein, the study of 2 
adult patients with SOCS1 haploinsufficiency illustrates the severe and 
pleomorphic consequences of its impaired regulation in the intestinal tract.
METHODS: Two unrelated adult patients presented with gastrointestinal 
manifestations, one with Crohn's disease-like ileo-colic inflammation refractory 
to anti-TNF and the other with lymphocytic leiomyositis causing severe chronic 
intestinal pseudo-occlusion. Next-generation sequencing was used to identify the 
underlying monogenic defect. One patient received anti-IL-12/IL-23 treatment 
while the other received the JAK1 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Peripheral blood, 
intestinal tissues, and serum samples were analyzed before-and-after JAK1 
inhibitor therapy using mass cytometry, histology, transcriptomic, and Olink 
assay.
RESULTS: Novel germline loss-of-function variants in SOCS1 were identified in 
both patients. The patient with Crohn-like disease achieved clinical remission 
with anti-IL-12/IL-23 treatment. In the second patient with lymphocytic 
leiomyositis, ruxolitinib induced rapid resolution of the obstructive symptoms, 
significant decrease of the CD8+ T lymphocyte muscular infiltrate, and 
normalization of serum and intestinal cytokines. Decreased frequencies of 
circulating Treg cells, MAIT cells, and NK cells, with altered 
CD56bright:CD16lo:CD16hi NK subtype ratios were not modified by ruxolitinib.
CONCLUSION: SOCS1 haploinsufficiency can result in a broad spectrum of 
intestinal manifestations and need to be considered as differential diagnosis in 
cases of severe treatment-refractory enteropathies, including the rare condition 
of lymphocytic leiomyositis. This provides the rationale for genetic screening 
and considering JAK inhibitors in such cases.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10875-023-01495-7

has been linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tissue fibrosis, pulmonary 
vascular disease, metastatic tumour development, increased tumour cell motility 
and invasiveness. This protein is reported to be also expressed in newly formed 
and differentiated fibroblasts and has been used in various studies to 
demonstrate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We aimed to characterize 
S100A4 positive cells in different human tissue compartments, with the focus on 
fibroblasts/myofibroblast. We found S100A4 expression in a wide range of cells. 
Fibroblasts/myofibroblasts showed a broad spectrum of staining intensity, 
ranging from negative to strong expression of S100A4, with the strongest 
expression in smooth muscle actin positive myofibroblasts. Cells of 
haematopoietic lineage, namely CD4 and CD8 positive T-lymphocytes, but not 
B-lymphocytes expressed S100A4. All investigated monocytes, macrophages and 
specialised histiocytes were positive for S100A4. Even some epithelial cells of 
the kidney and bladder were positive for S100A4. Expression was also found in 
the vasculature. Here, cells of the subendothelial space, tunica adventitia and 
some smooth muscle cells of the tunica media were positive for S100A4. In 
summary, S100A4 is expressed in various cell types of different lineage and is 
not, as originally believed, specific for fibroblasts (FSP). Results attained 
under the premise of specificity of FSP1/S100A4 for fibroblasts, like the 
founding research on EMT type 2 in kidney and liver, therefore need to be 
reinterpreted.","©The Author(s) 2023. Open Access. This article is licensed under a Creative

immune cells and the formation of lymph nodes. However, the temporal regulation 
mode of TOX on NK cell development and function needs to be further explored. 
Methods: To investigate the role of TOX in NK cells at distinct developmental 
phases, we deleted TOX at the hematopoietic stem cell stage (Vav-Cre), NK cell 
precursor (CD122-Cre) stage and late NK cell developmental stage (Ncr1-Cre), 
respectively. Flow cytometry was used to detect the development and functional 
changes of NK cell when deletion of TOX. RNA-seq was used to assess the 
differences in transcriptional expression profile of WT and TOX-deficient NK 
cells. Published Chip-seq data was exploited to search for the proteins directly 
interact with TOX in NK cells. Results: The deficiency of TOX at the 
hematopoietic stem cell stage severely retarded NK cell development. To a less 
extent, TOX also played an essential role in the physiological process of NKp 
cells differentiation into mature NK cells. Furthermore, the deletion of TOX at 
NKp stage severely impaired the immune surveillance function of NK cells, 
accompanied by down-regulation of IFN-γ and CD107a expression. However, TOX is 
dispensable for mature NK cell development and function. Mechanistically, by 
combining RNA-seq data with published TOX ChIP-seq data, we found that the 
inactivation of TOX at NKp stage directly repressed the expression of Mst1, an 
important intermediate kinase in Hippo signaling pathway. Mst1 deficient at NKp 
stage gained the similar phenotype with Toxfl/flCD122Cre mice. Conclusion: In 
our study, we conclude that TOX coordinates the early mouse NK cell development 
at NKp stage by maintaining the expression of Mst1. Moreover, we clarify the 
different dependence of the transcription factor TOX in NK cells biology.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/thno.81198

patients have been found to have defects in T cells activation, which is 
critical to the clearance of the bacilli. Treg cell suppression is mediated by 
inhibitory cytokines such as IL10, IL-35 and TGF-β and its frequency is higher 
in leprosy patients. Activation and overexpression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) 
receptor is considered to one of the pathways to inhibit T-cell response in 
human leprosy. In the current study we address the effect of PD-1 on Tregs 
function and its immuno-suppressive function in leprosy patients. Flow cytometry 
was used to evaluate the expression of PD-1 and its ligands on various immune 
cells T cells, B cells, Tregs and monocytes. We observed higher expression of 
PD-1 on Tregs is associated with lower production of IL-10 in leprosy patients. 
PD-1 ligands on T cells, B cells, Tregs and monocytes found to be higher in the 
leprosy patients as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, in vitro blocking 
of PD-1 restores the Tregs mediated suppression of Teff and increase secretion 
of immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. Moreover, overexpression of PD-1 positively 
correlates with disease severity as well as Bacteriological Index (BI) among 
leprosy patients. Collectively, our data suggested that PD-1 overexpression on 
various immune cells is associated with disease severity in human leprosy. 
Manipulation and inhibition of PD-1 signaling pathway on Tregs alter and restore

disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII) 
molecules can resolve organ inflammation in various disease models in a

invariably trigger the formation and systemic expansion of cognate

(T1D)-relevant pMHCII-NP types that display an epitope from the insulin B-chain

and timing of G protein signaling by increasing the GTPase activity of Gα 
protein subunits. The Rgs family member Rgs1 is one of the most up-regulated 
genes in tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells when compared to their circulating 
T cell counterparts. Functionally, Rgs1 preferentially deactivates Gαq, and Gαi 
protein subunits and can therefore also attenuate chemokine receptor-mediated 
immune cell trafficking. The impact of Rgs1 expression on tissue-resident T cell 
generation, their maintenance, and the immunosurveillance of barrier tissues, 
however, is only incompletely understood. Here we report that Rgs1 expression is 
readily induced in naïve OT-I T cells in vivo following intestinal infection 
with Listeria monocytogenes-OVA. In bone marrow chimeras, Rgs1 -/- and Rgs1 +/+ 
T cells were generally present in comparable frequencies in distinct T cell 
subsets of the intestinal mucosa, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. After 
intestinal infection with Listeria monocytogenes-OVA, however, OT-I Rgs1 +/+ T 
cells outnumbered the co-transferred OT-I Rgs1- /- T cells in the small 
intestinal mucosa already early after infection. The underrepresentation of the 
OT-I Rgs1 -/- T cells persisted to become even more pronounced during the memory 
phase (d30 post-infection). Remarkably, upon intestinal reinfection, mice with 
intestinal OT-I Rgs1 +/+ TRM cells were able to prevent the systemic 
dissemination of the pathogen more efficiently than those with OT-I Rgs1 -/- TRM 
cells. While the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated yet, these data 
thus identify Rgs1 as a critical regulator for the generation and maintenance of 
tissue-resident CD8+ T cells as a prerequisite for efficient local 
immunosurveillance in barrier tissues in case of reinfections with potential 
pathogens.","Copyright © 2023 von Werdt, Gungor, Barreto de Albuquerque, Gruber, Zysset,

them develop a rare but serious hyperinflammatory condition called multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). While several studies describe the 
clinical conditions of acute MIS-C, the status of convalescent patients in the 
months after acute MIS-C is still unclear, especially the question of 
persistence of changes in the specific subpopulations of immune cells in the 
convalescent phase of the disease.
METHODS: We therefore analyzed peripheral blood of 14 children with MIS-C at the 
onset of the disease (acute phase) and 2 to 6 months after disease onset 
(post-acute convalescent phase) for lymphocyte subsets and antigen-presenting 
cell (APC) phenotype. The results were compared with six healthy age-matched 
controls.
RESULTS: All major lymphocyte populations (B cells, CD4 + and CD8+ T cells, and 
NK cells) were decreased in the acute phase and normalized in the convalescent 
phase. T cell activation was increased in the acute phase, followed by an 
increased proportion of γ/δ-double-negative T cells (γ/δ DN Ts) in the 
convalescent phase. B cell differentiation was impaired in the acute phase with 
a decreased proportion of CD21 expressing, activated/memory, and class-switched 
memory B cells, which normalized in the convalescent phase. The proportion of 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conventional type 2 dendritic cells, and classical 
monocytes were decreased, while the proportion of conventional type 1 dendritic 
cells was increased in the acute phase. Importantly the population of 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells remained decreased in the convalescent phase, while 
other APC populations normalized. Immunometabolic analysis of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the convalescent MIS-C showed comparable 
mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis rates to healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: While both immunophenotyping and immunometabolic analyzes showed 
that immune cells in the convalescent MIS-C phase normalized in many parameters, 
we found lower percentage of plasmablasts, lower expression of T cell 
co-receptors (CD3, CD4, and CD8), an increased percentage of γ/δ DN Ts and 
increased metabolic activity of CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells. Overall, the 
results suggest that inflammation persists for months after the onset of MIS-C, 
with significant alterations in some immune system parameters, which may also 
impair immune defense against viral infections.","Copyright © 2023 Kopitar, Repas, Janžič, Bizjak, Vesel, Emeršič, Avramovič,

inflammation-based biomarker, which has been associated with long-term outcomes 
in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to investigate whether the 
CALLY index can predict the prognosis for distal cholangiocarcinoma after 
pancreaticoduodenectomy.
METHODS: The study comprised 143 patients who had undergone primary 
pancreaticoduodenectomy for distal cholangiocarcinoma between 2002 to 2019. The 
CALLY index was defined as (albumin × lymphocyte)/ (CRP × 104). We investigated 
the association of CALLY index with disease-free survival and overall survival 
by univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven (61%) patients had a preoperative CALLY index <3.5. In 
multivariate analysis, obstructive jaundice drainage (P < .01), poorly 
differentiated tumor (P < .01), and CALLY index<3.5 (P = .02) were independent 
predictors of disease-free survival, while obstructive jaundice drainage 
(P < .01), poorly differentiated tumor (P < .01), and CALLY index <3.5 (P = .02) 
were independent predictors of overall survival.
CONCLUSION: The CALLY index may be an independent and significant indicator of 
poor long-term outcomes in patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma after 
pancreaticoduodenectomy, suggesting the importance of comprehensive assessment 
for inflammatory status.","© 2022 The Authors. Annals of Gastroenterological Surgery published by John

uncontrolled immune response to infection. Sepsis prevalence is increased in 
developing countries and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Reports, 
although controversial, suggest that full blood count parameters and cell ratios 
could assist in the early screening for sepsis.
OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the use of haematological cell ratios in 
screening for sepsis in a South African population.
METHODS: The study retrospectively analysed the complete blood counts, blood 
cultures (BC) and biochemical test results of 125 adult patients who presented 
between January 2021 and July 2021 at a hospital in Cape Town. An 
ISO15189-accredited laboratory performed all of the tests. We compared and 
correlated the automated differential counts, neutrophil, monocyte and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios with procalcitonin levels. A p-value of < 0.05 was 
considered significant.
RESULTS: Sixty-two sepsis patients (procalcitonin > 2 ng/L and positive BC) were 
identified and compared to 63 non-sepsis controls. All cell ratios were 
significantly elevated in sepsis patients (p < 0.001). However, the two groups 
had no significant difference in absolute monocyte counts (p = 0.377). In 
addition, no correlation was detected between any cell ratios and procalcitonin.
CONCLUSION: In combination with complete blood count parameters, haematology 
cell ratios can be used for early sepsis detection. The full blood count is 
widely available, inexpensive, and routinely requested by emergency care 
clinicians. Although procalcitonin and BC remain the gold standard, the 
calculation of cell ratios could provide a simple screening tool for the early 
detection of sepsis.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study adds evidence to the proposal that calculating 
haematological cell ratios assists in the early screening of sepsis in a South 
African setting.",© 2023. The Authors.,"DOI: 10.4102/ajlm.v12i1.2104

and non-heritable factors. Among the latter, social and environmental 
determinants of health may influence and shape the immune system in early life. 
To study the relationship between leukocytes and determinants of health in 
adolescence, we assessed total and differential white blood cells (WBC) 
according to social and environmental determinants of health in a healthy 
adolescent population.
METHODS: As part of the population-based cohort Epidemiological Health 
Investigation of Teenagers in Porto (EPITeen), 1213 adolescents were evaluated 
at the age of 13. Total and differential WBC were evaluated through a venous 
blood sample using an automated blood counter (Sysmex®XE-5000, Hyogo, Japan). 
Sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical data were collected through 
self-administered questionnaires.
RESULTS: Participants with better socioeconomic conditions (enrolled at private 
schools or higher parental education) had significantly lower total WBC levels, 
and the latter showed a lower percentage of neutrophils and higher percentage of 
lymphocytes. Those who practiced sports had significantly lower total WBC levels 
and neutrophil percentage, as well as a significantly higher percentage of 
eosinophils and lymphocytes. Adolescents with chronic disease, chronic 
medication, or allergic diseases had a significantly higher percentage of 
eosinophils and a lower percentage of monocytes. With increasing body mass index 
and systemic inflammation, we found a significant increase in total WBC levels.

alterations in the upper gastrointestinal tract contribute to intestinal immune 
modulations. The present study aimed to investigate effects of a rumen 
cannulation in week 3 of life on the intestinal and tissue specific immune 
system of 34-week old heifers. Nutrition influences the development of the 
neonatal intestinal immune system to a high extent. Therefore, rumen cannulation 
was investigated in combination with different pre-weaning milk feeding 
intensities (20% (20MR) vs. 10% milk replacer feeding (10MR). Heifers of 20MR 
without rumen cannula (NRC) showed higher cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T 
cell subsets in mesenteric lymph nodes (MSL) compared to heifers with rumen 
cannula (RC) and 10MRNRC heifers. CD4+ T cell subsets in jejunal intraepithelial 
lymphocytes (IELs) were higher in 10MRNRC heifers compared to 10MRRC heifers. 
CD4+ T cell subsets in ileal IELs were lower and CD21+ B cell subsets were 
higher in NRC heifers compared to RC heifers. CD8+ T cell subsets in spleen 
tended to be lower in 20MRNRC heifers compared to all other groups. Splenic 
CD21+ B cell subsets were higher in 20MRNRC heifers compared to RC heifers. 
Splenic toll like receptor (TLR) 6 expression was increased and IL4 expression 
tended to be increased in RC heifers than NRC heifers. Splenic TLR2, 3 and 10 
gene expression was higher in 20MR compared to 10MR heifers. Jejunal 
prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 expression was higher in RC heifers than 
NRC heifers, and MUC2 expression tended to increase in 20MR heifers compared to 
10MR heifers. In conclusion, rumen cannulation modulated T and B cell subsets in 
the down streaming gastrointestinal tract and spleen. Pre-weaning feeding 
intensity seemed to affect intestinal mucin secretion and T and B cell subsets 
in MSL, spleen and thymus until several month later. Interestingly, in MSL,

powerful treatment option for previously non-treatable diseases. Although immune 
cell therapies are thought to be very specific, there is still the danger of 
developing severe to life-threatening side effects due to the unspecific 
distribution of the cells throughout the body (on-target/off-tumor effects). A 
possible solution for the reduction of these side effects and the improvement of 
tumor infiltration is the specific targeting of the effector cells (e.g., T 
cells) to the desired destination (e.g., tumor region). This can be achieved by 
the magnetization of cells with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles 
(SPIONs) for spatial guidance via external magnetic fields. A prerequisite for 
the use of SPION-loaded T cells in adoptive T cell therapies is that cell 
viability and functionality after nanoparticle loading are preserved. Here, we 
demonstrate a protocol to analyze cell viability and functionality such as 
activation, proliferation, cytokine release, and differentiation at a single 
cell level using flow cytometry.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business

the enzymatical, haematological, and histological changes in the gill, liver, 
and kidney of Pangasius hypophthalmus. The fish were divided into six groups and 
treated with different Pb concentrations. The LC50 value of Pb was 55.57 mg/L at 
96 h for P. hypophthalmus, and sublethal toxicity was assessed for 45 days at 
1/5th (11.47 mg/L) and 1/10th (5.57 mg/L) of LC50 concentration. Enzymes such as 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, 
alkaline phosphate (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) content increased 
significantly during sublethal toxicity of Pb. The reduction of HCT and PCV 
indicates an anemic condition due to the toxicity of Pb. Differential 
leucocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes and their % values significantly 
decreased, indicating Pb exposure. The main histological changes observed in the 
gills were the destruction of secondary lamellae, the fusion of adjacent gill 
lamellae, primary lamellae hypertrophy, and severe hyperplasia, while in kidney 
exposed to Pb showed melanomacrophages, increased periglomerular, peritubular 
space, vacuolation, shrunken glomerulus, destruction of tubular epithelium, and 
hypertrophy of distal convoluted segment. The liver showed severe necrosis and 
rupture of hepatic cells, hyper trepheoid bile duct, shifting of nuclei, and 
vascular hemorrhage, while in the brain, binucleus, mesoglea cells, vacuole, and 
ruptured nucleus were observed. In conclusion, P. hypophthalmus, which has been 
exposed to Pb has developed a number of toxicity markers. Consequently, 
prolonged exposure to higher Pb concentrations may be harmful to fish health. 
The findings strongly suggest that the lead had a detrimental impact on the P. 
hypophthalmus population, as well as on the water quality and non-target aquatic

immunology, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are critical in antitumor 
reaction related to immune checkpoint inhibition targeting programmed cell death 
protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1).
METHODS: In nude mice, which are immune deficient because they lack T cells, and 
inbred A/J mice, which are syngeneic to neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a) and have 
normal T cell function, we investigated the importance of T lymphocytes in 
immune checkpoint inhibition in mouse neuroblastoma and analyzed the immune 
cells in the tumor microenvironment. Then, we subcutaneously injected mouse 
Neuro-2ainto nude mice and A/J mice, administered anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 
antibodies by intraperitoneal injection, and evaluated tumor growth. At 16 d 
after Neuro-2a cells injection, mice were euthanized, tumors and spleens were 
harvested, and immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The antibodies suppressed tumor growth in A/J but not in nude mice. The 
co-administration of antibodies did not affect regulatory T cells (culster of 
differentiation [CD]4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells) or activated CD4+ lymphocytes 
(expressing CD69). No changes in activated CD8+ lymphocytes (expressing CD69) 
were observed in spleen tissue. However, increased infiltration of activated 
CD8+ TILs was seen in tumors weighing less than 300 mg, and the amount of 
activated CD8+ TILs was negatively correlated with tumor weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that lymphocytes are essential for the antitumor 
immune reaction induced by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 and raises the possibility that 
promoting the infiltration of activated CD8+ TIL into tumors may be an effective 
treatment for neuroblastoma.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2023.03.042

(1)Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty RWTH Aachen, University Pauwelstraße 
30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.","SCOPE: Zinc is important for a balanced immune system, but the mechanisms are 
not yet fully elucidated. One possibility is an interaction of zinc with the 
tricarbocylic acid cycle (TCA), in which zinc inhibits the mitochondrial 
aconitase leading to an increase in intracellular citrate concentration as 
described for prostate cells. Therefore, we studied the immune modulatory 
effects of zinc and citrate and their interaction in mixed lymphocyte cultures 
(MLC).
METHODS AND RESULTS: After allogeneic (MLC) or superantigen stimulation, the 
interferon-γ (IFNγ) production was quantified by ELISA and T cell subpopulations 
were determined by Western Blot. Intracellular concentrations of citrate and 
zinc were measured. Zinc and citrate reduce the IFNγ expression and the 
pro-inflammatory T helper cells (Th) 1 and Th17 in MLC. While zinc increases 
regulatory T cells, citrate reduces them. After superantigen stimulation IFNγ 
production is decreased only by citrate but increased by zinc. Zinc does not 
affect citrate concentration, while citrate impairs zinc uptake. Thus, zinc and 
citrate independently regulate IFNy expression.
CONCLUSION: These results may explain the immunosuppressive effect of blood 
products anticoagulated by citrate. In addition, high citrate consumption may 
lead to immunosuppressive effects, so upper limits for citrate should be 
established. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1002/mnfr.202200772

Houston, TX, United States.","T-cell subsets, including naïve (NA), central memory (CM), transitional memory 
(TM), effector memory (EM), and RA + effector memory (EMRA), differ in phenotype 
and function. T-cells are mobilized by exercise, with differences in the 
magnitude of mobilization between subsets. However, the response of TM T-cells 
to exercise has not yet been described. Further, T-cells expressing the late 
differentiation marker CD57 are known to be highly responsive to exercise, but 
the relative response of CD57 + and CD57- within T-cell subsets is unknown. We 
therefore aimed to characterize the exercise-induced mobilization of TM T-cells, 
as well as to compare the exercise response of CD57 + and CD57- cells within 
T-cell subsets.
METHODS: Seventeen participants (7 female; aged 18-40 years) cycled 30 min at 
80% of their estimated maximum heart rate. Venous blood obtained pre, post, and 
1H post-exercise was analyzed by flow cytometry. CD45RA, CCR7, and CD28 
expression within CD4 + and CD8+ T-cells identified NA, CM, TM, EM, and EMRA 
subsets. CD57 expression within EM, EMRA, and CD28+ T-cells was also quantified. 
The relative mobilization of each subset was compared by calculating fold change 
in cell concentration during (ingress, post/pre) and after exercise (egress,1H 
post/post). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus was determined by ELISA and was 
considered in models.
RESULTS: TM CD8+ T-cell concentration was greater post-exercise than 
pre-exercise (138.59 ± 56.42 cells/µl vs. 98.51 ± 39.68 cells/µl, p < 0.05), and 
the proportion of CD8 + with a TM phenotype was elevated 1H post-exercise (1H: 
32.44 ± 10.38% vs. Pre: 30.15 ± 8.77%, p < 0.05). The relative mobilization 
during and after exercise of TM T-cells did not differ from NA and CM but was 
less than EM and EMRA subsets. Similar results were observed within CD4+ 
T-cells. CD57 + subsets of CD28+ T-cells and of EM and EMRA CD8+ T-cells 
exhibited a greater relative mobilization than CD57- subsets (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate TM CD4 + and CD8+ T-cells are transiently 
mobilized into the blood with exercise, but not to as great of an extent as 
later differentiated EM and EMRA T-cells. Results also indicate CD57 identifies 
highly exercise responsive cells within CD8+ T-cell subsets.","© 2023 Hunt, Elzayat, Markofski, Laughlin and LaVoy.","DOI: 10.3389/fspor.2023.1120454

malignant features. Although endometriosis by itself is a benign disease, its 
erosive growth characteristics lead to severe pelvic pain and female 
infertility. Unfortunately, several aspects of the pathogenesis of endometriosis 
are still unclear. Furthermore, the clinical therapeutic methods are 
unsatisfactory. The recurrence rate of endometriosis is high. Accumulating 
evidence suggests that the onset and development of endometriosis are closely 
related to the abnormal function of the female autoimmune system, especially the 
function of some immune cells such as the aggregation of neutrophils, abnormal 
differentiation of macrophages, decreased cytotoxicity of NK cells, and abnormal 
function of T- and B-cell lines. Therefore, immunotherapy is probably a novel 
therapeutic strategy for endometriosis besides surgery and hormone therapy. 
However, information regarding the clinical application of immunotherapy in the 
treatment of endometriosis is very limited. This article aimed to review the 
effects of existing immunomodulators on the development of endometriosis, 
including immune cell regulators and immune factor regulators. These 
immunomodulators clinically or experimentally inhibit the pathogenesis and 
development of endometriosis lesions by acting on the immune cells, immune 
factors, or immune-related signaling pathways. Thus, immunotherapy is probably a 
novel and effective clinical treatment choice for endometriosis. Experimental 
studies of the detailed mechanism of immunotherapy and large-scale clinical 
studies about the effectiveness and safety of this promising therapeutic method 
are required in the future.","Copyright © 2023 Li, Lin, Qi, Lv, Yan, Xue and Mu.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1128301

cancer immunotherapy. Hybrids derived from cell-cell fusion are theoretically 
associated with tumor heterogeneity and progression by conferring novel 
properties on tumor cells, including drug resistance and metastatic capacity; 
however, their impact on immune evasion remains unknown. Here, we investigated 
the potency of tumor-macrophage hybrids in immune evasion. Hybrids were 
established by co-culture of a melanoma cell line (A375 cells) and type 2 
macrophages. The hybrids showed greater migration ability and greater 
tumorigenicity than the parental melanoma cells. The hybrids showed 
heterogeneous sensitivity to New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-1 
(NY-ESO-1)-specific T-cell receptor-transduced T (TCR-T) cells and two out of 
four hybrid clones showed less sensitivity to TCR-T compared with the parental 
cells. An in vitro tumor heterogeneity model revealed that the TCR-T cells 
preferentially killed the parental cells compared with the hybrids and the 
survival rate of the hybrids was higher than that of the parental cells, 
indicating that the hybrids evade killing by TCR-T cells efficiently. Analysis 
of a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of patients with melanoma revealed that 
a few macrophages expressed RNA encoding melanoma differentiation antigens 
including melan A, tyrosinase, and premelanosome protein, which indicated the 
presence of hybrids in primary melanoma. In addition, the number of potential 
hybrids was correlated with a poorer response to immune checkpoint blockade.

glycoprotein (MAG) is the most common paraproteinemic IgM neuropathy. Recently, 
the mutational profile of the MYD88 and CXCR4 genes has been included in the 
diagnostic workup of IgM monoclonal gammopathies. The objective of our study was 
to assess the prevalence of MYD88 L265P and CXCR4 S338X gene variants in 
patients with anti-MAG antibody neuropathy. Secondary aims were to evaluate 
possible correlations between the mutational profile and neuropathy severity, 
antibody titers, and treatment response.
METHODS: Seventy-five patients (47 men, mean age at molecular analysis 70.8 ± 
10.2 years; mean disease duration 5.1 ± 4.9 years) with anti-MAG antibody 
neuropathy were recruited. Among them, 38 (50.7%) had IgM monoclonal gammopathy 
of undetermined significance, 29 (38.7%) Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), and 
8 (10.6%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia/marginal zone lymphoma/hairy cell 
leukemia variant. Molecular analysis was performed on DNA from the bone marrow 
mononuclear cells in 55 of 75 patients and from peripheral mononuclear cells in 
18 of 75 patients. Forty-five patients were treated with rituximab, 6 with 
ibrutinib, 2 with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, and 3 with venetoclax-based 
therapy. All the patients were assessed with the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause 
and Treatment (INCAT) Disability Scale, INCAT Sensory Sum Score, and MRC Sum 
Score at baseline and follow-up. We considered as responders, patients who 
improved by at least 1 point in 2 clinical scales.
RESULTS: Fifty patients (66.7%) carried the MYD88L265P variant, with a higher 
frequency in WM and naive patients (77.2% vs 33.3%, p = 0.0012). No patients 
harbored the CXCR4S338X variant. There were no significant differences in 
hematologic data (IgM levels, M protein, and anti-MAG antibody titers), 
neuropathy severity, or response to rituximab in MYD88-altered and MYD88 
wild-type patients. Nine of 11 (81.8%) patients treated with novel targeted 
drug, according to the MYD88 status, responded to treatments.
DISCUSSION: MYD88L265P variant has a high prevalence (66.7%) in anti-MAG 
antibody neuropathy representing a potential effective mutational target for 
Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors. MYD88L265P variant, however, does not seem to 
be a prognostic factor of neuropathy severity or response to rituximab. In 
patients not responding or becoming refractory to rituximab, a tailored therapy 
with new effective target therapies should be considered.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on

and can be recognized by toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), activating the host's 
immune responses. In this study, ten different CpG ODNs were designed and 
synthesized to study the antibacterial immune responses of CpG ODNs in golden 
pompano (Trachinotus ovatus). Results showed that CpG ODN 2102 significantly 
improved the immunity of golden pompano against bacteria. Besides, CpG ODN 2102 
promoted the proliferation of head kidney lymphocytes and activated the head 
kidney macrophages. When TLR9-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to 
interfere with TLR9 expression, the immune responses were decreased. Moreover, 
the expression levels of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88), 
p65, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the TLR9-knockdown golden pompano kidney (GPK) 
cells were significantly reduced. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer 
of activated B cells (NF-κB) promoter activity of the TLR9-knockdown GPK cells 
was also significantly reduced. In vivo, the antibacterial immune effects 
induced by CpG ODN 2102 in golden pompano were mostly abolished when TLR9 
expression was knocked down. These results suggested that TLR9 was involved in 
the immune responses induced by CpG ODN 2102. CpG ODN 2102 also enhanced the 
protective effect of the Vibrio harveyi vaccine pCTssJ, where the survival rate 
of golden pompano was significantly improved by 20%. In addition, CpG ODN 2102 
enhanced the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of TLR9, Myxovirus 
resistance (Mx), interferon γ (IFN-γ), TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, major 
histocompatibility complex class (MHC) Iα, MHC IIα, Immunoglobulin D (IgD), and 
IgM. Therefore, TLR9 was involved in the antibacterial immune responses induced 
by CpG ODN 2102 and CpG ODN 2102 possessed adjuvant immune effects. These 
results enlarged our knowledge of the antibacterial immunity of fish TLRs 
signaling pathway and had important implications for exploring natural 
antibacterial molecules in fish and developing new vaccine adjuvants.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.fsi.2023.108783

dysfunction of the affected exocrine glands. Lymphocytic infiltration within the 
inflamed glands and aberrant B cell hyperactivation are the two salient 
pathological features in SS. Increasing evidence indicates that salivary gland 
(SG) epithelial cells act as a key regulator in the pathogenesis of SS, as 
revealed by the dysregulated innate immune signaling pathways in SG epithelium 
and increased expression of various proinflammatory molecules as well as their 
interaction with immune cells. In addition, SG epithelial cells can regulate 
adaptive immune responses as non-professional antigen-presenting cells and 
promote the activation and differentiation of infiltrated immune cells. 
Moreover, the local inflammatory milieu can modulate the survival of SG 
epithelial cells, leading to enhanced apoptosis and pyroptosis with the release 
of intracellular autoantigens, which further contributes to SG autoimmune 
inflammation and tissue destruction in SS. Herein, we reviewed recent advances 
in elucidating the role of SG epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of SS, which 
may provide rationales for potential therapeutic targeting of SG epithelial 
cells to alleviate SG dysfunction alongside treatments with immunosuppressive

an ultra-rare combined primary immunodeficiency disease caused by heterozygous 
gain-of-function mutations in the chemokine receptor CXCR4. WHIM patients 
typically present with recurrent acute infections associated with myelokathexis 
(severe neutropenia due to bone marrow retention of mature neutrophils). Severe 
lymphopenia is also common, but the only associated chronic opportunistic 
pathogen is human papillomavirus and mechanisms are not clearly defined. In this 
study, we show that WHIM mutations cause more severe CD8 than CD4 lymphopenia in 
WHIM patients and WHIM model mice. Mechanistic studies in mice revealed 
selective and WHIM allele dose-dependent accumulation of mature CD8 
single-positive cells in thymus in a cell-intrinsic manner due to prolonged 
intrathymic residence, associated with increased CD8 single-positive thymocyte 
chemotactic responses in vitro toward the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12. In addition, 
mature WHIM CD8+ T cells preferentially home to and are retained in the bone 
marrow in mice in a cell-intrinsic manner. Administration of the specific CXCR4 
antagonist AMD3100 (plerixafor) in mice rapidly and transiently corrected T cell 
lymphopenia and the CD4/CD8 ratio. After lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus 
infection, we found no difference in memory CD8+ T cell differentiation or viral 
load between wild-type and WHIM model mice. Thus, lymphopenia in WHIM syndrome 
may involve severe CXCR4-dependent CD8+ T cell deficiency resulting in part from

autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. However, the connection between SL, the 
immune system, and autoimmune diseases remains unknown.
METHODS: We conducted mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and flow 
cytometry to analyze how SL influences immune system and autoimmune disease 
development. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six healthy subjects before 
and after SL were collected and analyzed by mass cytometry experiments and 
subsequent bioinformatic analysis to identify the effects of SL on human immune 
system. Sleep deprivation and experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice model 
were constructed, and scRNA-seq data from mice cervical draining lymph nodes 
were generated to explore how SL influences EAU development and related 
autoimmune responses.
RESULTS: We found compositional and functional changes in human and mouse immune 
cells after SL, especially in effector CD4+ T and myeloid cells. SL upregulated 
serum GM-CSF levels in healthy individuals and in patients with SL-induced 
recurrent uveitis. Experiments in mice undergoing SL or EAU demonstrated that SL 
could aggravate autoimmune disorders by inducing pathological immune cell 
activation, upregulating inflammatory pathways, and promoting intercellular 
communication. Furthermore, we found that SL promoted Th17 differentiation, 
pathogenicity, and myeloid cells activation through the IL-23Th17GM-CSF feedback 
mechanism, thus promoting EAU development. Lastly, an anti-GM-CSF treatment 
rescued SL-induced EAU aggravation and pathological immune response.
CONCLUSIONS: SL promoted Th17 cells pathogenicity and autoimmune uveitis 
development, especially through the interaction between Th17 and myeloid cells 
involving GM-CSF signaling, providing possible therapeutic targets for the 
SL-related pathological disorders.","© 2023 The Authors. Clinical and Translational Medicine published by John Wiley

with high heterogeneity. Ferroptosis is a novel cell death induced by iron and 
lipid peroxidation and exhibits prognostic value in many cancers. Emerging 
studies on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and ferroptosis reveal the unique 
value in tumorigenesis. However, the prognostic value of ferroptosis-related 
lncRNAs (FRLs) remains unclear in CLL.
AIM: We aimed to construct a FRLs risk model to predict prognosis and improve 
prognostic stratification for clinical practice.
METHODS: RNA-sequencing data and clinical characteristics of CLL patients were 
downloaded from the GEO database. Based on ferroptosis-related genes from FerrDb 
database, differentially expressed FRLs with prognostic significance were 
identified and used to generate the risk model. The capability of the risk model 
was assessed and evaluated. GO and KEGG analyses were performed to confirm 
biological roles and potential pathways.
RESULTS: A novel ferroptosis-related lncRNAs prognostic score (FPS) model 
containing six FRLs (PRKCQ, TRG.AS1, LNC00467, LNC01096, PCAT6 and SBF2.AS1) was 
identified. Patients in the training and validation cohort were evenly divided 
into high- and low-risk groups. Our results indicated that patients in the 
high-risk group had worse survival than those in the low-risk group. Functional 
enrichment analyses showed that the differently expressed genes (DEGs) between 
the two groups were enriched in the chemokine signaling pathway, hematopoietic 
cell lineage, T cell differentiation, TCR pathway and NF-κB pathway. Moreover, 
significant differences in immune cell infiltration were also observed. 
Surprisingly, FPS was proved to be an independent prognostic indicator for OS.
CONCLUSION: We established and evaluated a novel prognostic risk model with 6 
FRLs that could predict prognosis accurately and describe the distinct immune 
infiltration in CLL.",© 2023 Xu et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/IJGM.S399629

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Immune-mediated rejection was the major cause of graft dysfunction. 
Although the advances in immunosuppressive agents have markedly reduced the 
incidence of T-cell-mediated rejection after transplantation. However, the 
incidence of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) remains high. Donor-specific 
antibodies (DSAs) were considered the major mediators of allograft loss. 
Previously, we showed that treatment with 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) 
ligands inhibited the differentiation and effector functions of T cells and 
reduced the rejection observed after allogeneic skin transplantation in mice. 
This study we further investigate the effect of TSPO ligands on B cells and DSAs 
production in the recipients of mixed-AMR model.
METHODS: In vitro, we explored the effect of treatment with TSPO ligands on the 
activation, proliferation, and antibody production of B cells. Further, we 
established a heart-transplantation mixed-AMR model in rats. This model was 
treated with the TSPO ligands, FGIN1-27 or Ro5-4864, to investigate the role of 
ligands in preventing transplant rejection and DSAs production in vivo. As TSPO 
was the mitochondrial membrane transporters, we then investigated the TSPO 
ligands effect on mitochondrial-related metabolic ability of B cells as well as 
expression of downstream proteins.
RESULTS: In vitro studies, treatment with TSPO ligands inhibited the 
differentiation of B cells into CD138+CD27+ plasma cells; reduced antibodies, 
IgG and IgM, secretion of B cells; and suppressed the B cell activation and 
proliferation. In the mixed-AMR rat model, treatment with FGIN1-27 or Ro5-4864 
attenuated DSA-mediated cardiac-allograft injury, prolonged graft survival, and 
reduced the numbers of B cells, including IgG+ secreting B cells, T cells and 
macrophages infiltrating in grafts. For the further mechanism exploration, 
treatment with TSPO ligands inhibited the metabolic ability of B cells by 
downregulating expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and proteins in 
complexes I, II, and IV of the electron transport chain.
CONCLUSIONS: We clarified the mechanism of action of TSPO ligands on B-cell 
functions and provided new ideas and drug targets for the clinical treatment of 
postoperative AMR.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-023-04134-2

lymphoma (LGITL) are common diseases in older cats, but their diagnosis and 
differentiation remain challenging.
OBJECTIVES: To summarize the current literature on etiopathogenesis and 
diagnosis of LPE and LGITL in cats and provide guidance on the differentiation 
between LPE and LGITL in cats. To provide statements established using 
evidence-based approaches or where such evidence is lacking, statements based on 
consensus of experts in the field.
ANIMALS: None.
METHODS: A panel of 6 experts in the field (2 internists, 1 radiologist, 1 
anatomic pathologist, 1 clonality expert, 1 oncologist) with the support of a 
human medical immunologist, was formed to assess and summarize evidence in the 
peer-reviewed literature and complement it with consensus recommendations.
RESULTS: Despite increasing interest on the topic for clinicians and 
pathologists, few prospective studies were available, and interpretation of the 
pertinent literature often was challenging because of the heterogeneity of the 
cases. Most recommendations by the panel were supported by a moderate or low 
level of evidence. Several understudied areas were identified, including 
cellular markers using immunohistochemistry, genomics, and transcriptomic 
studies.

known biomarker reliably differentiates inflammatory lesions from neoplastic 
lymphoproliferations in the intestinal tract of cats and a diagnosis currently 
is established by integrating all available clinical and diagnostic data.

differently. While the left hemisphere enhances cellular immunity, the right 
hemisphere inhibits it.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether immune and inflammatory markers correlated with 
stroke severity and hospitalization duration as a function of stroke side.
METHODS: The study included 137 patients with unilateral ischemic stroke. The 
medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical laboratory data, 
including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, its 
differential stroke side and stroke severity according to the National Institute 
of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and length of hospital stay (LOS). We examined 
differences between right side (RS) and left side (LS) stroke on immune and 
inflammatory markers and compared correlations between these markers and NIHSS 
and LOS as a function of stroke side.
RESULTS: RS stroke patients had higher CRP and monocytes than LS stroke 
patients. In RS stroke patients, CRP, total WBC, and lymphocyte levels 
positively correlated with both NIHSS and LOS, whereas levels of neutrophils 
were positively correlated with NIHSS alone. No correlations were found for LS 
stroke patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Immune-inflammatory markers correlated with stroke severity and LOS 
only in patients with RS stroke. Neuroimmunological processes influence 
short-term clinical outcomes after stroke, especially considering the 
differential effects of the hemispheres on immunity. Prospective studies that 
evaluate long-term clinical outcomes are needed. Testing the effects of

restricted lineage output in vivo. Currently, the molecular mechanisms and 
physiological role of HSC fate restriction remain unknown. Here we show that 
lymphoid fate is epigenetically but not transcriptionally primed in HSCs. In 
multi-lineage HSCs that produce lymphocytes, lymphoid-specific upstream 
regulatory elements (LymUREs) but not promoters are preferentially accessible 
compared with platelet-biased HSCs that do not produce lymphoid cell types, 
providing transcriptionally silent lymphoid lineage priming. Runx3 is 
preferentially expressed in multi-lineage HSCs, and reinstating Runx3 expression 
increases LymURE accessibility and lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor 4 
(MPP4) output in old, platelet-biased HSCs. In contrast, platelet-biased HSCs 
show elevated levels of epigenetic platelet-lineage priming and give rise to 
MPP2 progenitors with molecular platelet bias. These MPP2 progenitors generate 
platelets with faster kinetics and through a more direct cellular pathway 
compared with MPP2s derived from multi-lineage HSCs. Epigenetic programming 
therefore predicts both fate restriction and differentiation kinetics in HSCs.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41556-023-01137-5

used as a delivery system for inducing a strong T-cell immune response or

long-circling liposomes conjugated with anti-CD-205 receptor antibodies to 
produce CD-205-targeted liposomes (iLPSM). We explored using a series of 
experiments evaluating the targeting efficiency of iLPSM. In vitro, iLPSM 
nanoparticles promoted the proliferation of macrophages, and the nanoparticles 
were rapidly phagocytized by macrophages. In vivo, iLPSM significantly improved 
the antibody titers of OVA-specific IgG and IgG, isotypes cytokine production, 
and T and B lymphocyte differentiation. Furthermore, iLPSM facilitated the 
maturation of DCs. In addition, iLPSM nanoparticles could prolong the retention

regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK) deficiency can cause functional 
disorders in neutrophils and macrophages under high oxidative stress, but the 
precise mechanisms by which PRAK regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
elimination and its potential impact on CD4+ T helper subset function are 
unclear. The present study reveals that the PRAK-NF-E2-related factor 2(NRF2) 
axis is essential for maintaining the intracellular redox homeostasis of T 
helper 17(Th17) cells, thereby promoting Th17 cell differentiation and antitumor 
effects. Through mechanistic analysis, we identify NRF2 as a novel protein 
substrate of PRAK and find that PRAK enhances the stability of the NRF2 protein 
through phosphorylation NRF2 Serine(S) 558 independent of protein 
ubiquitination. High accumulation of cellular ROS caused by loss of PRAK 
disrupts both glycolysis and PKM2-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3, which 
subsequently impairs the differentiation of Th17 cells. As a result, Prak 
knockout (KO) mice display significant resistance to experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) but impaired antitumor immunity in a MC38 tumor model. 
This work reveals that the PRAK-NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathway is a metabolic 
checkpoint that controls Th17-cell glycolysis and differentiation. Targeting 
PRAK is a promising strategy for maintaining an active ROS scavenging system and 
may lead to potent Th17 cell antitumor immunity.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2212613120

clinical outcome from Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) in patients with solid 
tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a large cohort of ICI recipients treated at 21 
institutions from June 2014 to June 2020, we studied whether patients on glucose 
lowering medications (GLM) for T2DM had shorter OS and PFS. We used targeted 
transcriptomics in a subset of patients to explore differences in the tumor 
microenvironment of patients with/without diabetes.
RESULTS: A total of 1395 patients were included. Primary tumors included NSCLC 
(54.7%), melanoma (24.7%), renal cell (15.0%) and other carcinomas (5.6%). 
Following multivariable analysis, patients on GLM (n=226, 16.2%) displayed an 
increased risk of death (HR 1.29, 95%CI:1.07-1.56) and disease progression/death 
(HR 1.21, 95%CI:1.03-1.43) independent of number of GLM received. We matched 92 
metformin exposed with 363 controls and 78 patients on other oral GLM or insulin 
with 299 control patients. Exposure to metformin, but not other GLM was 
associated with an increased risk of death (HR 1.53, 95%CI:1.16-2.03) and 
disease progression/death (HR 1.34, 95%CI:1.04-1.72). T2DM patients with higher 
pre-treatment glycaemia had higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p=0.04), 
while exploratory tumoral transcriptomic profiling in a subset of patients 
(n=22) revealed differential regulation of innate and adaptive immune pathways 
in T2DM patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study patients on GLM experienced worse outcomes from 
immunotherapy, independent of baseline features. Prospective studies are 
warranted to clarify the relative impact of metformin over a pre-existing 
diagnosis of T2DM in influencing poorer outcomes in this population.","DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-3116

immunosuppressive properties. An effective measure to regulate tumor immunity is 
brachytherapy, which uses 125I seeds planted into tumor. T cell immune receptors 
with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) is highly expressed in HCC. The 
TIGIT-targeted probe is expected to be an effective tool for indicating 
immunomodulation of 125I seed brachytherapy in HCC. In this study, We 
constructed a novel peptide targeting TIGIT to evaluate the immune regulation of 
125I seed brachytherapy for HCC by near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF).
METHODS: Expression of TIGIT by immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry (FCM) 
in different part and different differentiated human liver cancer tissues was 
verified. An optical fluorescence probe (Po-12) containing a NIRF dye and TIGIT 
peptide was synthesized for evaluating the modulatory effect of 125I seed 
brachytherapy. Lymphocytes uptake by Po-12 were detected by FCM and confocal 
microscopy. The distribution and accumulation of Po-12 in vivo were explored by 
NIRF imaging in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors. IHC and IF staining were 
used to verify the expression of TIGIT in the tumors.
RESULTS: TIGIT was highly expressed in HCC and increased with tumor 
differentiation. The dye-labeled peptide (Po-12) retained a stable binding 
affinity for the TIGIT protein in vitro. Accumulation of fluorescence intensity 
(FI) increased with time extended in subcutaneous H22 tumors, and the optimal 
point is 1 h. TIGIT was highly expressed on lymphocytes infiltrated in tumors 
and could be suppressed by 125I seed brachytherapy. Accumulation of Po-12-Cy5 
was increased in tumor-bearing groups while declined in 125I radiation group.","Copyright © 2023 Zeng, Shen, Shu, Min, Shu, Yao, Wang and Chen.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1143266

problem. Cuproptosis is a novel form of cell death that plays a crucial role in 
tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, it remains unclear whether 
cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) influence the outcomes and immune 
microenvironment of HCC patients.
METHOD: From The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome 
Consortium (ICGC) databases, we obtained the mRNA expression file and related 
clinical information of HCC patients. We selected 19 CRGs as candidate genes for 
this study according to previous literature. We performed a differential 
expression analysis of the 19 CRGs between malignant and precancerous tissue. 
Based on the 19 CRGs, we enrolled cluster analysis to identify 
cuproptosis-related subtypes of HCC patients. A prognostic risk signature was 
created utilizing univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses. We employed independent and 
stratification survival analyses to investigate the predictive value of this 
model. The functional enrichment features, mutation signatures, immune profile, 
and response to immunotherapy of HCC patients were also investigated according 
to the two molecular subtypes and the prognostic signature.
RESULTS: We found that 17 CRGs significantly differed in HCC versus normal 
samples. Cluster analysis showed two distinct molecular subtypes of cuproptosis. 
Cluster 1 is preferentially related to poor prognosis, high activity of immune 
response signaling, high mutant frequency of TP53, and distinct immune cell 
infiltration versus cluster 2. Through univariate and LASSO Cox regression 
analyses, we created a cuproptosis-related prognostic risk signature containing 
LIPT1, DLAT, MTF1, GLS, and CDKN2A. High-risk HCC patients were shown to have a 
worse prognosis. The risk signature was proved to be an independent predictor of 
prognosis in both the TCGA and ICGC datasets, according to multivariate 
analysis. The signature also performed well in different stratification of 
clinical features. The immune cells, which included regulatory T cells (Treg), B 
cells, macrophages, mast cells, NK cells, and aDCs, as well as immune functions 
containing cytolytic activity, MHC class I, and type II IFN response, were 
remarkably distinct between the high-risk and low-risk groups. The tumor immune 
dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score suggested that high-risk patients had a 
higher response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors than low-risk patients.
CONCLUSION: This research discovered the potential prognostic and immunological 
significance of cuproptosis in HCC, improved the understanding of cuproptosis, 
and may deliver new directions for developing more efficacious therapeutic 
techniques for HCC patients.",Copyright © 2023 Xiaolong Tang et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/3951940

and the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is well known, the role of 
novel biomarkers in predicting the development of DVT in diabetic patients is 
not yet known to a large extent. Studies have shown that complete blood count 
(CBC) and CBC-derived parameters such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 
and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) can be used as surrogate markers to 
detect DVT. This study was conducted to assess the utility of NLR and PLR as a 
marker of DVT in diabetic patients. Methodology This case-control study was 
conducted among a calculated sample size of 109 DVT patients in one arm and 109 
non-DVT patients in another arm. Hematological tests including total leucocyte 
count, differential leucocyte count, total neutrophil count, total lymphocyte 
count, total platelet count, NLR, and PLR were performed. Results We found a 
significant difference in NLR and PLR between the DVT and the non-DVT groups. In 
addition, we found that NLR and PLR were significantly higher in the diabetic 
group, indicating the presence of inflammation in association with diabetes 
mellitus. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve showed that at 
a cut-off value of 2.83, NLR can detect DVT in diabetic patients with 67% 
sensitivity and 92% specificity. Similarly, PLR at a cut-off value of 131.46 can 
detect DVT in diabetic patients with 56% sensitivity and 90% specificity.

proven to be closely related to the development, metastasis, and recurrence of 
tumors. Gut microbiota and its fermented-metabolites short-chain fatty acids

gastrointestinal tumors. Consisting mainly of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, 
SCFAs can interact with G protein-coupled receptors 43 of T helper 1 cell or

production in TIME. Additionally, SCFAs can alter epigenetic modification of 
CD8+ T cells by inhibiting HDACs to participate in the immune response process. 
In gastrointestinal tumors, the abundance of SCFAs and their producing bacteria 
is significantly reduced. Direct supplementation of dietary fiber and 
probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation to change the structure of gut

that support and orchestrate the responses of other lymphocytes. However, they 
can also develop potent granzyme (Gzm)-mediated cytotoxic activity and CD4+ 
cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) have been amply documented both in humans and in mice, 
particularly in the context of human chronic infection and cancer. Despite the 
established description of CD4+ CTLs, as well as of the critical cytotoxic 
activity they exert against MHC class II-expressing targets, their developmental 
and memory maintenance requirements remain elusive. This is at least in part 
owing to the lack of a murine experimental system where CD4+ CTLs are stably 
induced. Here, we show that viral and bacterial vectors encoding the same 
epitope induce distinct CD4+ CTL responses in challenged mice, all of which are 
nevertheless transient in nature and lack recall properties. Consistent with 
prior reports, CD4+ CTL differentiation is accompanied by loss of TCF-1 
expression, a transcription factor considered essential for memory T cell 
survival. Using genetic ablation of Tcf7, which encodes TCF-1, at the time of 
CD4+ T cell activation, we further show that, contrary to observations in CD8+ T 
cells, continued expression of TCF-1 is not required for CD4+ T cell memory 
survival. Whilst Tcf7-deficient CD4+ T cells persisted normally following 
retroviral infection, the CD4+ CTL subset still declined, precluding conclusive 
determination of the requirement for TCF-1 for murine CD4+ CTL survival. Using 
xenotransplantation of human CD4+ T cells into murine recipients, we demonstrate 
that human CD4+ CTLs develop and persist in the same experimental conditions 
where murine CD4+ CTLs fail to persist. These observations uncover a 
species-specific defect in murine CD4+ CTL persistence with implications for 
their use as a model system.","Copyright © 2023 Hofland, Danelli, Cornish, Donnarumma, Hunt, de Carvalho and

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: In vertebrates, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) 
emerge from hemogenic endothelium in the floor of the dorsal aorta and 
subsequently migrate to secondary niches where they expand and differentiate 
into committed lineages. Glia maturation factor γ (gmfg) is a key regulator of 
actin dynamics that was shown to be highly expressed in hematopoietic tissue. 
Our goal is to investigate the role and mechanism of gmfg in embryonic HSPC 
development.
METHODS: In-depth bioinformatics analysis of our published RNA-seq data 
identified gmfg as a cogent candidate gene implicated in HSPC development. Loss 
and gain-of-function strategies were applied to study the biological function of 
gmfg. Whole-mount in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, 
and western blotting were used to evaluate changes in the number of various 
hematopoietic cells and expression levels of cell proliferation, cell apoptosis 
and hematopoietic-related markers. RNA-seq was performed to screen signaling 
pathways responsible for gmfg deficiency-induced defects in HSPC initiation. The 
effect of gmfg on YAP sublocalization was assessed in vitro by utilizing HUVEC 
cell line.
RESULTS: We took advantage of zebrafish embryos to illustrate that loss of gmfg 
impaired HSPC initiation and maintenance. In gmfg-deficient embryos, the number 
of hemogenic endothelium and HSPCs was significantly reduced, with the 
accompanying decreased number of erythrocytes, myelocytes and lymphocytes. We 
found that blood flow modulates gmfg expression and gmfg overexpression could 
partially rescue the reduction of HSPCs in the absence of blood flow. Assays in 
zebrafish and HUVEC showed that gmfg deficiency suppressed the activity of YAP, 
a well-established blood flow mediator, by preventing its shuttling from 
cytoplasm to nucleus. During HSPC initiation, loss of gmfg resulted in Notch 
inactivation and the induction of Notch intracellular domain could partially 
restore the HSPC loss in gmfg-deficient embryos.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that gmfg mediates blood flow-induced HSPC maintenance 
via regulation of YAP, and contributes to HSPC initiation through the modulation 
of Notch signaling. Our findings reveal a brand-new aspect of gmfg function and 
highlight a novel mechanism for embryonic HSPC development.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13287-023-03328-1

(#)Contributed equally","Chronic viral infection impairs systemic immunity in the host; however, the 
mechanism underlying the dysfunction of immune cells in chronic viral infection 
is incompletely understood. In this study, we studied the lineage 
differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during chronic viral 
infection to elucidate the changes in dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and 
subsequent impact on T cell functionality using a chronic lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model. We first investigated the lineage 
differentiation of HSCs in the bone marrow (BM) to elucidate the modulation of 
immune cell differentiation and found that the populations highly restrained in 
their differentiation were common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and common 
dendritic cell progenitors (CDPs). Of interest, the main immune cells infected 
with LCMV Clone 13 (CL13) in the BM were CD11b/c+ myeloid DCs. We next 
characterized CD11b+ DCs that differentiated during chronic LCMV infection. 
These DCs displayed a less immunogenic phenotype than DCs in naive or acutely 
infected mice, showing low expression of CD80 but high expression of PD-L1, 
B7-H4, IDO, TGF-β, and IL-10. Consequently, these CD11b+ DCs induced less 
effective CD8+ T cells and more Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. Furthermore, 
CD11b+ DCs generated during CL13 infection could not induce effective CD8+ T 
cells specific to the antigens of newly invading pathogens. Our findings 
demonstrate that DCs generated from the BM during chronic viral infection cannot 
activate fully functional effector CD8+ T cells specific to newly incoming 
antigens as well as persistent antigens themselves, suggesting a potential cause 
of the functional alterations in the T cell immune response during chronic viral 
infection.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s12276-023-00991-5

signaling is triggered by the cross-linking of multiple RANKL trimers to form a 
molecular cluster. In adults, RANKL is expressed primarily in bone tissue and 
the immune system. In bone tissue, the functions of RANKL forward and reverse 
signaling have been separately analyzed; the forward signaling is responsible 
for bone resorption by inducing the maturation of osteoclasts, while the reverse 
signaling is activated by vesicular RANK, one of the osteoclast-derived coupling 
factors, leading to the promotion of early osteoblast differentiation. In the 
immune system, RANKL is expressed on lymphocytes and the interaction with 
antigen-presenting cells such as RANK-expressing dendritic cells should result 
in the activation of both the forward and the reverse signaling, however, the 
discrimination of the function of each pathway has not been achieved yet. To 
activate RANKL reverse signaling, a multivalent protein construct of anti-RANKL 
single-chain Fv multimerized with peptide linkers would be effective, since this 
type of construct can induce cluster formation by cross-linking RANKL trimers. 
It was also found that the divalent construct with minimal molecular size can 
cross-link the RANKL trimer without affecting the forward signaling. On the 
other hand, the design of constructs to inhibit the activation of RANKL reverse 
signaling needs to be tested experimentally. Particularly, it may be necessary 
to obtain small molecules that act on the RANKL intracellular domain to achieve 
selective inhibition of the reverse signaling without affecting the forward 
signaling.","DOI: 10.1254/fpj.22145

challenging issue. In this study, we began our study by using a murine contact 
hypersensitivity (CHS) model of ACD to examine the immunosuppressive effects of 
DYRK1B inhibition. We found that mice treated with a selective DYRK1B inhibitor 
show reduced ear inflammation. In addition, a significant reduction of Th1 and 
Th17 cells in the regional lymph node upon DYRK1B inhibition was observed by 
FACS analysis. Studies in vitro further revealed that DYRK1B inhibitor does not 
only suppressed Th1 and Th17 differentiation, but also promotes regulatory T 
cells (Treg) differentiation. Mechanistically, FOXO1 signaling was enhanced due 
to the suppression of FOXO1Ser329 phosphorylation in the presence of DYRK1B 
inhibitor. Therefore, these findings suggest that DYRK1B regulates CD4 T cell 
differentiation through FOXO1 phosphorylation and DYRK1B inhibitor has a 
potential as a novel agent for treatment of ACD.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-34211-x

worsening left pelvic limb lameness of 3 weeks duration. The initial examination 
identified a consistent lameness at a walk. Neurological examination showed 
sensory and gait abnormalities consistent with left femoral nerve dysfunction. 
The horse minimally advanced the leg cranially and had a shortened stride length 
at the walk. During the stance phase, the heels of the left hind foot did not 
contact the ground and the horse quickly took weight off of the limb. Diagnostic 
imaging (ultrasound and nuclear scintigraphy) examinations did not reaveal a 
cause. Severe lymphocytosis was identified on complete blood cell count (69,600 
cells /uL; reference range: 1,500-4,000 cells/uL), suggestive of lymphoma. 
Postmortem examination revealed focal swelling of the left femoral nerve. 
Multiple masses were found in the stomach, large colon, adrenal gland, 
mesentery, heart and meninges. The entire left pelvic limb was dissected and did 
not reveal other causes of the gait deficit. Histologic evaluation of the left 
femoral nerve revealed disseminated intermediate cell size B cell lymphoma, with 
an immunophenotype suggestive of plasmacytoid differentiation. These lymphocytes 
infiltrated the femoral nerve at the location of the focal nerve swelling, in 
addition to other peripheral nerves. This case highlights a horse with an 
atypical diagnosis of femoral nerve paresis caused by direct neoplastic 
lymphocyte infiltration, deriving from disseminated B cell lymphoma with 
plasmacytoid differentiation (neurolymphomatosis). Though rare, disseminated 
lymphoma with direct nerve infiltration should be considered in horses with

following heart transplantation (HTx) are barely defined. Here, we aimed to 
delineate the early alloimmune response immediately after HTx. Therefore, blood 
samples from 23 heart-transplanted patients were collected before (pre-), 
immediately (T0), 24 hours (T24), and 3 weeks (3 wks) after HTx. 
Immunophenotyping was performed using flow cytometry. A significant increase was 
detected for terminally differentiated (TEMRA) CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and CD56dim 
CD16+ NK cells immediately after HTx linked to a decrease in naïve CD8+ and CM 
CD4+ T as well as CD56bright CD16- NK cells, returning to baseline levels at 
T24. More detailed analyses revealed increased CD69+ CD25- and diminished CD69- 
CD25- CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell proportions at T0 associated with decreasing S1PR1 
expression. Passenger T and NK cells were found at low frequencies only in 
several patients at T0 and did not correlate with lymphocyte alterations. 
Collectively, these results suggest an immediate, transient shift toward memory 
T and NK cells following HTx. Opposite migratory properties of naïve versus

cells (Treg cells) has been extensively studied, the molecular switch to alter 
energy metabolism remains undefined. The present study explores the critical 
role of mitochondrial dynamics in the reprogramming and consequent generation of 
Treg cells. The results showed that during Treg cell differentiation, 
mitochondrial fusion but not fission led to elevation of oxygen consumption rate 
values, facilitation of metabolic reprogramming, and increase of number of Treg 
cells and expression of Foxp3 in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 
mitochondrial fusion favored fatty acid oxidation but restricted glycolysis in 
Treg cells through down-regulating the expression of HIF-1α. Transforming growth 
factor-β1 (TGF-β1) played a crucial role in the induction of mitochondrial 
fusion, which activated Smad2/3, promoted the expression of PGC-1α and therefore 
facilitated the expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins. In conclusion, 
during Treg cell differentiation, TGF-β1 promotes PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial 
fusion, which drives metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis to fatty acid 
oxidation via suppressing HIF-1α expression, and therefore favors the generation 
of Treg cells. The signals and proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion are 
potential therapeutic targets for Treg cell-related diseases.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.redox.2023.102709

memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells, including multipotency and effector programs, are 
poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the role of the TF Bcl11b in 
TRM cells during infection with Listeria monocytogenes using mice with 
post-activation, conditional deletion of Bcl11b in CD8+ T cells. Conditional 
deletion of Bcl11b resulted in increased numbers of intestinal TRM cells and 
their precursors as well as decreased splenic effector and circulating memory 
cells and precursors. Loss of circulating memory cells was in part due to 
increased intestinal homing of Bcl11b-/- circulating precursors, with no major 
alterations in their programs. Bcl11b-/- TRM cells had altered transcriptional 
programs, with diminished expression of multipotent/multifunctional (MP/MF) 
program genes, including Tcf7, and up-regulation of the effector program genes, 
including Prdm1. Bcl11b also limits the expression of Ahr, another TF with a 
role in intestinal CD8+ TRM cell differentiation. Deregulation of TRM programs 
translated into a poor recall response despite TRM cell accumulation in the 
intestine. Reduced expression of MP/MF program genes in Bcl11b-/- TRM cells was 
linked to decreased chromatin accessibility and a reduction in activating 
histone marks at these loci. In contrast, the effector program genes displayed 
increased activating epigenetic status. These findings demonstrate that Bcl11b 
is a frontrunner in the tissue residency program of intestinal memory cells 
upstream of Tcf1 and Blimp1, promoting multipotency and restricting the effector 
program.","DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.abn0484

preoperative consolidating chemotherapy (CTx), that is, total neoadjuvant 
therapy (TNT), improves local control and complete response (CR) rates in 
locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), putting the focus on organ preservation 
concepts. Therefore, assessing response before surgery is crucial. Some LARC 
patients would either not benefit from intensification by TNT or may reach CR, 
making resection not mandatory. Treatment of LARC should therefore be based on 
patient individual risk and response to avoid overtreatment.The ""PRIMO"" pilot 
study aims to determine early response assessment to form a basis for 
development and validation of a noninvasive response prediction model by a 
subsequent prospective multicenter trial, which is highly needed for individual, 
response-driven therapy adaptions.
METHODS: PRIMO is a prospective observational cohort study including adult 
patients with LARC receiving neoadjuvant CRT. At least 4 multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] and 
hypoxia-sensitive sequences) as well as repeated blood samples in order to 
analyze circulating tumor cells (CTC) and cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) are 
scheduled. Pelvic radiotherapy (RT, 50.4 Gy) will be performed in combination 
with a 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin regimen in all patients (planned: N = 50), 
succeeded by consolidation CTx (FOLFOX4) if feasible. Additional 
(immuno)histochemical markers, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status will be analyzed before and after CRT. 
Routine resection is scheduled subsequently, nonoperative management is offered 
alternatively in case of clinical CR (cCR).The primary endpoint is pathological 
response; secondary endpoints comprise longitudinal changes in MRI as well as in 
CTCs and TIL. These are evaluated for early response prediction during 
neoadjuvant therapy, in order to develop a noninvasive response prediction model 
for subsequent analyses.
DISCUSSION: Early response assessment is the key in differentiating ""good"" and 
""bad"" responders during neoadjuvant CRT, allowing adaption of subsequent 
therapies (additional consolidating CTx, organ preservation). This study will 
contribute in this regard, by advancing MR imaging and substantiating new 
surrogate markers. Adaptive treatment strategies might build on these results in 
further studies.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000033575

of the pituitary gland, typically in the context of an adenoma. It typically 
presents with a thunderclap headache and sterile cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). 
The authors identify a case of PA, which initially presented with the signs and 
symptoms of viral meningitis.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 44-year-old man presented to the emergency department 
with headache, nuchal rigidity, fever, and delirium. The patient reported a 
10-year history of chronic that were partially responsive to acetaminophen. Four 
days after admission, the patient developed right-sided cranial nerve III, IV, 
and VI palsies. Labs revealed anemia and hyponatremia. The CSF was leukocytic, 
lymphocyte-predominant, and had elevated protein. In addition to these results, 
negative CSF bacterial cultures led the care team to believe this case was viral 
meningoencephalitis. Routine MRI of the brain at presentation revealed a 
3.1×2.5×3.2 (craniocaudal×anterior posterior×transverse) expansile mass centered 
within the sella turcica. An endocrine workup revealed hypopituitarism. The 
diagnosis of PA was then made. A microscopic transsphenoidal resection of the 
sellar mass was performed, and histopathologic analysis confirmed necrotic 
pituitary adenoma tissue. Following an uncomplicated procedure, the patient 
recovered fully from his cranial nerve palsies and continues to do well.
DISCUSSION: Because life-threatening hypotension from acute adrenal 
insufficiency can be caused by PA, timely diagnosis is crucial. When a patient 
presents with meningism, PA should be included in the differential diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: This report illustrates a case of PA presenting with symptoms and a 
CSF profile classically associated with viral meningitis.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MS9.0000000000000323

affects the physical and mental health of patients. Drug resistance has been 
developed upon current drug treatments, and there is no specific therapy. The 
aim of this study was to screen promising novel drug candidates for PSO using 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
METHODS: The data of PSO were downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO) 
database and subjected to variance analysis. Target proteins and small molecule 
compounds targeting PSO were predicted in the connective map (cMAP) database. 
Molecular docking, MD simulation, and trajectory analysis were conducted to 
predict the binding of target proteins to compounds.
RESULTS: 1999 differentially expressed genes in PSO were obtained by 
differential analysis. Through cMAP database prediction, a low Score value of 
-45.69 for lymphocyte cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (LCK) was revealed, 
and aminogenistein was identified as the compound targeting LCK, and LCK was 
notably highly expressed in the PSO samples. The drugScore of the binding pocket 
P_0 was 0.814656, which was docked with aminogenistein. The results showed that 
there were more than one binding site between LCK and aminogenistein with 
binding energy less than -7.0 kJ/mol, and the docking was relatively stable. The 
results of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation 
(RMSF), Gyrate, number of hydrogen bonds and total free binding energy in MD 
simulations showed that the binding of aminogenistein to LCK was relatively 
solid.
CONCLUSION: Aminogenistein has good protein-ligand interaction and stability 
with LCK, a target of PSO, and is a novel drug candidate for PSO.","© 2023 The Authors. Skin Research and Technology published by John Wiley & Sons

individuals following natural infection or vaccination. In addition to already 
known factors, such as age, sex, COVID-19 severity, comorbidity, vaccination 
status, hybrid immunity, and duration of infection, inter-individual variations 
in SARS-CoV-2 immune responses may, in part, be explained by structural 
differences brought about by genetic variation in the human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) molecules responsible for the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens to T 
effector cells. While dendritic cells present peptides with HLA class I 
molecules to CD8+ T cells to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses (CTLs), 
they present peptides with HLA class II molecules to T follicular helper cells 
to induce B cell differentiation followed by memory B cell and plasma cell 
maturation. Plasma cells then produce SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Here, we 
review published data linking HLA genetic variation or polymorphisms with 
differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. While there is evidence 
that heterogeneity in antibody response might be related to HLA variation, there 
are conflicting findings due in part to differences in study designs. We provide 
insight into why more research is needed in this area. Elucidating the genetic 
basis of variability in the SARS-CoV-2 immune response will help to optimize 
diagnostic tools and lead to the development of new vaccines and therapeutics 
against SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases.","DOI: 10.3390/v15040906

alopecia that predominantly affects women of African descent. Recent studies 
have demonstrated prevalence in children and adolescents, as well as Asian 
populations. A thorough search of Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews, OVID Medline and Google Scholar was conducted using keywords such as 
""central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia"", ""scarring hair loss"", ""scarring 
alopecia"", ""hot comb alopecia"", ""pediatric"" and ""adolescent"". The results 
yielded few articles in the literature that directly addressed CCCA in the 
adolescent population, with three articles providing details of the presentation 
in the form of case series and retrospective reviews. The presentation in the 
adolescent population was found to be varied, ranging from asymptomatic to 
symptomatic and involving diffuse to patchy hair loss in only the vertex and/or 
frontal and parietal scalp. Genetic and environmental etiologies were found to 
be statistically significant, and markers of metabolic dysregulation 
predisposing patients to diabetes mellitus and breast cancer were also 
uncovered. The differential diagnosis of patients who present with hair loss in 
the adolescent population should therefore be broad, and a low threshold for 
biopsies should be adopted to confirm CCCA in suspected patients. This will have 
future implications for reduced morbidity and public health.","DOI: 10.3390/life13041022

bone erosion, and joint deformation. Synovial tissue in RA patients is full of 
proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrated immune cells, such as T help (Th) 9, 
Th17, macrophages, and osteoclasts. Recent reports emphasized a new member of 
the interleukin (IL)-10 family, IL-26, an inducer of IL-17A that is 
overexpressed in RA patients. Our previous works found that IL-26 inhibits 
osteoclastogenesis and conducts monocyte differentiation toward M1 macrophages. 
In this study, we aimed to clarify the effect of IL-26 on macrophages linking to 
Th9 and Th17 in IL-9 and IL-17 expression and downstream signal transduction. 
Murine and human macrophage cell lines and primary culture cells were used and 
stimulated by IL26. Cytokines expressions were evaluated by flow cytometry. 
Signal transduction and transcription factors expression were detected by 
Western blot and real time-PCR. Our results show that IL-26 and IL-9 colocalized 
in macrophage in RA synovium. IL-26 directly induces macrophage inflammatory 
cytokines IL-9 and IL-17A expression. IL-26 increases the IL-9 and IL-17A 
upstream mechanisms IRF4 and RelB expression. Moreover, the AKT-FoxO1 pathway is 
also activated by IL-26 in IL-9 and IL-17A expressing macrophage. Blockage of 
AKT phosphorylation enhances IL-26 stimulating IL-9-producing macrophage cells. 
In conclusion, our results support that IL-26 promotes IL-9- and 
IL-17-expressing macrophage and might initiate IL-9- and IL-17-related adaptive 
immunity in rheumatoid arthritis. Targeting IL-26 may a potential therapeutic 
strategy for rheumatoid arthritis or other IL-9 plus IL-17 dominant diseases.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24087526

tumor cells with magnetic nanoparticles. While these cancer cells are typically 
present in low numbers, we hypothesized that magnetic nanoparticles, besides 
catching single cells, are also capable of eliminating a large number of tumor 
cells from the blood ex vivo. This approach was tested in a small pilot study in 
blood samples of patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a 
mature B-cell neoplasm. Cluster of differentiation (CD) 52 is a ubiquitously 
expressed surface antigen on mature lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab (MabCampath®) is a 
humanized, IgG1κ, monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, which was formerly 
clinically approved for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 
therefore regarded as an ideal candidate for further tests to develop new 
treatment options. Alemtuzumab was bound onto carbon-coated cobalt 
nanoparticles. The particles were added to blood samples of CLL patients and 
finally removed, ideally with bound B lymphocytes, using a magnetic column. Flow 
cytometry quantified lymphocyte counts before, after the first, and after the 
second flow across the column. A mixed effects analysis was performed to 
evaluate removal efficiency. p < 0.05 was defined as significant. In the first 
patient cohort (n = 10), using a fixed nanoparticle concentration, CD19-positive 
B lymphocytes were reduced by 38% and by 53% after the first and the second 
purification steps (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005), respectively. In a second patient 
cohort (n = 11), the nanoparticle concentration was increased, and CD19-positive 
B lymphocytes were reduced by 44% (p < 0.001) with no further removal after the 
second purification step. In patients with a high lymphocyte count (>20 G/L), an 
improved efficiency of approximately 20% was observed using higher nanoparticle 
concentrations. A 40 to 50% reduction of B lymphocyte count using 
alemtuzumab-coupled carbon-coated cobalt nanoparticles is feasible, also in 
patients with a high lymphocyte count. A second purification step did not 
further increase removal. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that such 
particles allow for the targeted extraction of larger amounts of cellular blood 
components and might offer new treatment options in the far future.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24087523

the risk of developing active tuberculosis by 10-20 times compared with HIV- 
LTBI+ patients. It is crucial to understand how HIV can dysregulate immune 
responses in LTBI+ individuals. Plasma samples collected from healthy and

ultimately causing poor survival outcomes. Overcoming immunosuppression and 
stimulating durable antitumor immunity are essential for tumor treatment. In our 
previous study, a novel cryo-thermal therapy involving liquid nitrogen freezing 
and radiofrequency heating could reduce the proportion of Myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs), but the remaining MDSCs produced IL-6 by the NF-κB 
pathway, resulting in an impaired therapeutic effect. Therefore, here we 
combined cryo-thermal therapy with anti-IL-6 treatment to target the 
MDSC-dominant immunosuppressive environment, thereby optimizing the efficacy of 
cryo-thermal therapy. We found that combinational treatment significantly 
increased the long-term survival rate of breast cancer-bearing mice. Mechanistic 
investigation revealed that combination therapy was capable of reducing the 
proportion of MDSCs in the spleen and blood while promoting their maturation, 
which resulted in increased Th1-dominant CD4+ T-cell differentiation and 
enhancement of CD8+ T-mediated tumor killing. In addition, CD4+ Th1 cells 
promoted mature MDSCs to produce IL-7 through IFN-γ, indirectly contributing to 
the maintenance of Th1-dominant antitumor immunity in a positive feedback loop. 
Our work suggests an attractive immunotherapeutic strategy targeting the 
MDSC-dominant immunosuppressive environment, which would offer exciting 
opportunities for highly immunosuppressive and unresectable tumors in the

Tatarstan Russia. The majority of patients are adults, with infection rarely 
diagnosed in children. This limited number of pediatric NE cases means there is 
an inadequate understanding of disease pathogenesis in this age category. Here, 
we have analyzed clinical and laboratory data in adults and children with NE to 
establish whether and how the disease severity differs between the two age 
groups. Serum cytokines were analyzed in samples collected from 11 children and 
129 adult NE patients during an outbreak in 2019. A kidney toxicity panel was 
also used to analyze urine samples from these patients. Additionally, serum and 
urine samples were analyzed from 11 control children and 26 control adults. 
Analysis of clinical and laboratory data revealed that NE was milder in children 
than in adults. A variation in serum cytokine activation could explain the 
differences in clinical presentation. Cytokines associated with activation of 
Th1 lymphocytes were prominent in adults, while they were obscured in sera from 
pediatric NE patients. In addition, a prolonged activation of kidney injury 
markers was found in adults with NE, whilst only a short-lasting activation of 
these markers was observed in children with NE. These findings support previous 
observations of age differences in NE severity, which should be considered when 
diagnosing the disease in children.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24087016

cancer-related deaths due to its aggressive nature, late-stage detection, and 
high tolerance to standard therapies. Thus, novel treatment strategies for type 
II EC are imperative. For patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors, 
immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors represents a promising 
therapeutic strategy. However, the prevalence of dMMR tumors in type II EC 
patients remains unclear. In this study, using immunohistochemistry, we 
evaluated the expression of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (CD8+), and immune checkpoint molecules (PD-L1) in 60 patients with 
type II EC (16, 5, 17, and 22 were endometrioid G3, serous, de-differentiated, 
and carcinosarcoma cases, respectively) to investigate the therapeutic effect of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. Approximately 24 cases (40%) had a loss of MMR 
protein expression. The positivity rate of CD8+ (p = 0.0072) and PD-L1 (p = 
0.0061) expression was significantly associated with the dMMR group. These 
results suggest immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1/PD-1 antibodies) could 
effectively treat type II EC with dMMR. The presence of dMMR might be a 
biomarker for a positive response to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in type II EC.","DOI: 10.3390/healthcare11081073

been traditionally related to bone metabolism, although several studies in the 
last decade have suggested its role in sarcopenia, cardiovascular and 
neurological diseases, insulin-resistance and diabetes, malignancies, and 
autoimmune diseases and infections. In the pandemic era, by considering the 
response of the different branches of the immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
our aims are both to analyse, among the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D, how 
its strong multimodal modulatory effect on the immune system is able to affect 
the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease and to emphasise a possible relationship 
between the well-known circannual fluctuations in blood levels of this hormone 
and the epidemiological trend of this infection, particularly in the elderly 
population. The biologically active form of vitamin D, or calcitriol, can 
influence both the innate and the adaptive arm of the immune response. 
Calcifediol levels have been found to be inversely correlated with upper 
respiratory tract infections in several studies, and this activity seems to be 
related to its role in the innate immunity. Cathelicidin is one of the main 
underlying mechanisms since this peptide increases the phagocytic and germicidal 
activity acting as chemoattractant for neutrophils and monocytes, and 
representing the first barrier in the respiratory epithelium to pathogenic 
invasion. Furthermore, vitamin D exerts a predominantly inhibitory action on the 
adaptive immune response, and it influences either cell-mediated or humoral 
immunity through suppression of B cells proliferation, immunoglobulins 
production or plasma cells differentiation. This role is played by promoting the 
shift from a type 1 to a type 2 immune response. In particular, the suppression 
of Th1 response is due to the inhibition of T cells proliferation, 
pro-inflammatory cytokines production (e.g., INF-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-17) and 
macrophage activation. Finally, T cells also play a fundamental role in viral 
infectious diseases. CD4 T cells provide support to B cells antibodies 
production and coordinate the activity of the other immunological cells; 
moreover, CD8 T lymphocytes remove infected cells and reduce viral load. For all 
these reasons, calcifediol could have a protective role in the lung damage 
produced by COVID-19 by both modulating the sensitivity of tissue to angiotensin 
II and promoting overexpression of ACE-2. Promising results for the potential 
effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the severity of COVID-19 
disease was demonstrated in a pilot clinical trial of 76 hospitalised patients 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection where oral calcifediol administration reduced the need 
for ICU treatment. These interesting results need to be confirmed in larger 
studies with available information on vitamin D serum levels.","DOI: 10.3390/ijerph20085432

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease in which 
pregnancy leads to a temporary amelioration in disease activity as indicated by 
the profound decrease in relapses rate during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are implicated in MS pathogenesis as being key regulators 
of inflammation and brain lesion formation. Although Tcells are prime candidates 
for the pregnancy-associated improvement of MS, the precise mechanisms are yet 
unclear, and in particular, a deep characterization of the epigenetic and 
transcriptomic events that occur in peripheral T cells during pregnancy in MS is 
lacking.
METHODS: Women with MS and healthy controls were longitudinally sampled before, 
during (1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters) and after pregnancy. DNA methylation array 
and RNA sequencing were performed on paired CD4+ and CD8+ T cells samples. 
Differential analysis and network-based approaches were used to analyze the 
global dynamics of epigenetic and transcriptomic changes.
RESULTS: Both DNA methylation and RNA sequencing revealed a prominent 
regulation, mostly peaking in the 3rd trimester and reversing post-partum, thus 
mirroring the clinical course with improvement followed by a worsening in 
disease activity. This rebound pattern was found to represent a general 
adaptation of the maternal immune system, with only minor differences between MS 
and controls. By using a network-based approach, we highlighted several genes at 
the core of this pregnancy-induced regulation, which were found to be enriched 
for genes and pathways previously reported to be involved in MS. Moreover, these 
pathways were enriched for in vitro stimulated genes and pregnancy hormones 
targets.
CONCLUSION: This study represents, to our knowledge, the first in-depth 
investigation of the methylation and expression changes in peripheral CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells during pregnancy in MS. Our findings indicate that pregnancy 
induces profound changes in peripheral T cells, in both MS and healthy controls, 
which are associated with the modulation of inflammation and MS activity.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12974-023-02781-2

(#)Contributed equally","The immune synapse is a key structure organizing T-cell activation against 
foreign entities, such as cancer cells expressing neoantigens. One crucial step 
in this activation cascade is the intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) response that 
shapes T cells for proliferation, differentiation, and cytotoxicity. The 
development of calcium probes coupled to real-time fluorescence microscopy has 
allowed a close study of this phenomenon in vitro. Such systems have provided 
valuable insights on the consequences of Ca2+ responses on T cells, including 
cytotoxicity and cytoskeletal remodeling. However, in vitro models do not 
recapitulate the tissue architecture that T cells come in contact with in vivo. 
Thus, there is a growing necessity for better understanding the factors 
influencing Ca2+ response in T cells including in genetically modified T cells 
(e.g., CAR T cells). In this methodology chapter, we describe an experimental 
system to measure [Ca2+]i signals of CAR T cells loaded with the calcium probe 
Fluo-4 on fresh tumor slices. Combined with confocal fluorescent imaging, this 
model offers an approach to image early T-cell activation in a three-dimensional 
(3D) tissue environment.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business

disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and consequent lesion of 
exocrine glands. SjS diagnosis and classification remains a challenge, 
especially at SjS onset, when patients may have milder phenotypes of the disease 
or uncommon presentations. New biomarkers are needed for the classification of 
SjS, thus, we aimed to evaluate the added-value of lymphocyte subpopulations in 
discriminating SjS and non-Sjögren Sicca patients. Lymphocyte subsets from 62 
SjS and 63 Sicca patients were characterized by flow cytometry. The 2002 AECG 
and the 2016 ACR/EULAR SjS classification criteria were compared with clinical 
diagnosis. The added discriminative ability of joining lymphocytic populations 
to classification criteria was assessed by the area under the 
Receiver-Operating-Characteristic Curve (AUC). Considering clinical diagnosis as 
the gold-standard, we obtained an AUC = 0.952 (95% CI: 0.916-0.989) for AECG and 
an AUC = 0.921 (95% CI: 0.875-0.966) for ACR/EULAR criteria. Adding Tfh and Bm1 
subsets to AECG criteria, performance increased, attaining an AUC = 0.985 (95% 
CI: 0.968-1.000) (p = 0.021). Th1/Breg-like CD24hiCD27+ and switched-memory 
B-cells maximized the AUC of ACR/EULAR criteria to 0.953 (95% CI: 0.916-0.990) 
(p = 0.043). Our exploratory study supports the potential use of lymphocyte 
subpopulations, such as unswitched memory B cells, to improve the performance of 
classification criteria, since their discriminative ability increases when 
specific subsets are added to the criteria.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-31782-7

therefore it is important to elucidate its toxicity profile. CYN has been 
classified as a cytotoxin, although the scientific literature has already 
revealed that it affects a wide range of organs and systems. However, research 
on its potential immunotoxicity is still limited. Thus, this study aimed to 
evaluate the impact of CYN on two human cell lines representative of the immune 
system: THP-1 (monocytes) and Jurkat (lymphocytes). CYN reduced cell viability, 
leading to mean effective concentrations (EC50 24 h) of 6.00 ± 1.04 µM and 5.20 
± 1.20 µM for THP-1 and Jurkat cells, respectively, and induced cell death 
mainly by apoptosis in both experimental models. Moreover, CYN decreased the 
differentiation of monocytes to macrophages after 48 h of exposure. In addition, 
an up-regulation of the mRNA expression of different cytokines, such as 
interleukin (IL) 2, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and 
interferon-gamma (INF-γ), was also observed mainly after 24 h exposure in both 
cell lines. However, only an increase in TNF-α in THP-1 supernatants was 
observed by ELISA. Overall, these results suggest the immunomodulatory activity 
of CYN in vitro. Therefore, further research is required to evaluate the impact 
of CYN on the human immune system.","DOI: 10.3390/toxins15040301

their tightly regulated differentiation to epithelial cells is essential for the 
maintenance of the gut epithelial barrier and its functions. How these processes 
are tuned by diet and gut microbiome is an important, but poorly understood 
question. Dietary soluble fibers, such as inulin, are known for their ability to 
impact the gut bacterial community and gut epithelium, and their consumption has 
been usually associated with health improvement in mice and humans. In this 
study, we tested the hypothesis that inulin consumption modifies the composition 
of colonic bacteria and this impacts intestinal stem cells functions, thus 
affecting the epithelial structure.
METHODS: Mice were fed with a diet containing 5% of the insoluble fiber 
cellulose or the same diet enriched with an additional 10% of inulin. Using a 
combination of histochemistry, host cell transcriptomics, 16S microbiome 
analysis, germ-free, gnotobiotic, and genetically modified mouse models, we 
analyzed the impact of inulin intake on the colonic epithelium, intestinal 
bacteria, and the local immune compartment.
RESULTS: We show that the consumption of inulin diet alters the colon epithelium 
by increasing the proliferation of intestinal stem cells, leading to deeper 
crypts and longer colons. This effect was dependent on the inulin-altered gut 
microbiota, as no modulations were observed in animals deprived of microbiota, 
nor in mice fed cellulose-enriched diets. We also describe the pivotal role of 
γδ T lymphocytes and IL-22 in this microenvironment, as the inulin diet failed 
to induce epithelium remodeling in mice lacking this T cell population or 
cytokine, highlighting their importance in the diet-microbiota-epithelium-immune 
system crosstalk.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the intake of inulin affects the activity 
of intestinal stem cells and drives a homeostatic remodeling of the colon 
epithelium, an effect that requires the gut microbiota, γδ T cells, and the 
presence of IL-22. Our study indicates complex cross kingdom and cross cell type 
interactions involved in the adaptation of the colon epithelium to the luminal 
environment in steady state. Video Abstract.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40168-023-01520-2

predicting clinical response accurately and reliably remains challenging. 
Neoantigen load is considered as a fundamental genetic determinant of 
therapeutic response. However, only a few predicted neoantigens are highly 
immunogenic, with little focus on intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in the 
neoantigen landscape and its link with different features in the tumor 
microenvironment. To address this issue, we comprehensively characterized 
neoantigens arising from nonsynonymous mutations and gene fusions in lung cancer 
and melanoma. We developed a composite NEO2IS to characterize interplays between 
cancer and CD8+ T-cell populations. NEO2IS improved prediction accuracy of 
patient responses to immune-checkpoint blockades (ICBs). We found that TCR 
repertoire diversity was consistent with the neoantigen heterogeneity under 
evolutionary selections. Our defined neoantigen ITH score (NEOITHS) reflected 
infiltration degree of CD8+ T lymphocytes with different differentiation states 
and manifested the impact of negative selection pressure on CD8+ T-cell lineage 
heterogeneity or tumor ecosystem plasticity. We classified tumors into distinct 
immune subtypes and examined how neoantigen-T cells interactions affected 
disease progression and treatment response. Overall, our integrated framework 
helps profile neoantigen patterns that elicit T-cell immunoreactivity, enhance 
the understanding of evolving tumor-immune interplays and improve prediction of 
ICBs efficacy.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41388-023-02670-1

controls cell motility, which is crucial for scanning peripheral tissues to 
detect pathogens, and recruiting immune cells to sites of infection; immune

innate immune system rapidly mounts a preliminary nonspecific defense, while the 
acquired immune system slowly develops microbe-killing specialists. These 
responses cause inflammation, and along with the pathogen cause direct and 
indirect tissue damage, which anti-inflammatory mediators seek to temper. This 
interplay of systems is credited for maintaining homeostasis but may produce 
unexpected results such as disease tolerance. Tolerance is characterized by the 
persistence of pathogen and damage mitigation, where the relevant mechanisms are 
poorly understood. In this work we develop an ordinary differential equations 
model of the immune response to infection in order to identify key components in 
tolerance. Bifurcation analysis uncovers health, immune- and pathogen-mediated 
death clinical outcomes dependent on pathogen growth rate. We demonstrate that 
decreasing the inflammatory response to damage and increasing the strength of 
the immune system gives rise to a region in which limit cycles, or periodic 
solutions, are the only biological trajectories. We then describe areas of 
parameter space corresponding to disease tolerance by varying immune cell decay,

identifier: NCT02447003), first-line and second-line or later pembrolizumab 
monotherapy demonstrated antitumor activity in metastatic triple-negative breast 
cancer (mTNBC; N = 254). This exploratory analysis evaluates the association 
between prespecified molecular biomarkers and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Cohort A enrolled patients with disease progression after one or more 
systemic therapies for metastatic disease irrespective of PD-L1 status; Cohort B 
enrolled patients with previously untreated PD-L1-positive (combined positive 
score [CPS] ≥ 1) metastatic disease. The association between the following 
biomarkers as continuous variables and clinical outcomes (objective response 
rate [ORR], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall survival [OS]) was 
evaluated: PD-L1 CPS (immunohistochemistry), cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8; 
immunohistochemistry), stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (sTIL; hematoxylin 
and eosin staining), tumor mutational burden (TMB; whole-exome sequencing 
[WES]), homologous recombination deficiency-loss of heterozygosity, mutational 
signature 3 (WES), mutational signature 2 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing 
catalytic polypeptide-like; WES), T-cell-inflamed gene expression profile 
(TcellinfGEP; RNA sequencing), and 10 non-TcellinfGEP signatures (RNA 
sequencing); Wald test P values were calculated, and significance was 
prespecified at α = 0.05.
RESULTS: In the combined cohorts (A and B), PD-L1 (P = .040), CD8 (P < .001), 
sTILs (P = .012), TMB (P = .007), and TcellinfGEP (P = .011) were significantly 
associated with ORR; CD8 (P < .001), TMB (P = .034), Signature 3 (P = .009), and 
TcellinfGEP (P = .002) with PFS; and CD8 (P < .001), sTILs (P = .004), TMB (P = 
.025), and TcellinfGEP (P = .001) with OS. None of the non-TcellinfGEP 
signatures were associated with outcomes of pembrolizumab after adjusting for 
the TcellinfGEP.
CONCLUSION: In this exploratory biomarker analysis from KEYNOTE-086, baseline 
tumor PD-L1, CD8, sTILs, TMB, and TcellinfGEP were associated with improved 
clinical outcomes of pembrolizumab and may help identify patients with mTNBC who 
are most likely to respond to pembrolizumab monotherapy.","DOI: 10.1200/PO.22.00317

group of soft tissue tumors that encompasses low-grade lesions (angiomatoid 
fibrous histiocytoma/AFH) and a group of predominantly intra-abdominal 
aggressive sarcomas with epithelioid morphology and frequent keratin expression. 
Both entities occasionally harbor EWSR1::ATF1 fusions as alternate to the more 
frequent EWSR1/FUS::CREB1/CREM fusions. Although EWSR1/FUS-CREB-rearranged 
epithelioid malignant neoplasms have been described in diverse intra-abdominal 
sites, none involved the female adnexa. Herein, we describe three cases 
involving uterine adnexa in young females (41, 39, and 42-year-old); two 
associated with constitutional inflammatory symptoms. The tumors presented as a 
serosal surface mass of the ovary without parenchymal involvement (Case 1), as 
circumscribed nodule within ovarian parenchyma (Case 2), and as a periadnexal 
mass extending into the lateral uterine wall with lymph node metastasis (Case 
3). They were composed of sheets and nests of large epithelioid cells with 
numerous stromal lymphocytes and plasma cells. The neoplastic cells expressed 
desmin and EMA, and variably WT1. One tumor expressed in addition AE1/AE3, MUC4, 
synaptophysin, chromogranin, and ALK. None expressed sex cord-associated 
markers. RNA sequencing identified EWSR1::ATF1 fusions in two cases and an 
EWSR1::CREM fusion in one. Exome-based RNA capture sequencing and clustering 
methods showed high transcriptomic proximity of tumor 1 with soft tissue AFH. 
This novel subset of female adnexal neoplasms should be included in the 
differential diagnosis of any epithelioid neoplasm involving female adnexa. 
Their aberrant immunophenotype can be misleading, underlining a wide spectrum of 
differential diagnosis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00428-023-03546-1

bacterial replication. Here we compared the gene expression profiles of T cells 
in pulmonary granulomas, bronchoalveolar lavage, and blood of Mtb-infected 
rhesus macaques to identify granuloma-enriched T cell genes. TNFRSF8/CD30 was 
among the top genes upregulated in both CD4 and CD8 T cells from granulomas. In 
mice, CD30 expression on CD4 T cells is required for survival of Mtb infection, 
and there is no major role for CD30 in protection by other cell types. 
Transcriptomic comparison of WT and CD30-/- CD4 T cells from the lungs of 
Mtb-infected mixed bone marrow chimeric mice showed that CD30 directly promotes 
CD4 T cell differentiation and the expression of multiple effector molecules. 
These results demonstrate that the CD30 co-stimulatory axis is highly 
upregulated on granuloma T cells and is critical for protective T cell responses

patients with myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS),the proportion of activated T cells 
with immunophenotype CD3+HLA-DR+ in the lymphocytes and its clinical 
significance, and to understand the effects of different types of MDS, different 
immunophenotypes, and different expression levels of WT1 on the proportion of 
lymphocyte subsets and activated T cells.
METHODS: The immunophenotypes of 96 MDS patients, the subsets of bone marrow 
lymphocytes and activated T cells were detected by flow cytometry. The relative 
expression of WT1 was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, and 
the first induced remission rate (CR1) was calculated, the differences of 
lymphocyte subsets and activated T cells in MDS patients with different 
immunophenotype, different WT1 expression, and different course of disease were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: The percentage of CD4+T lymphocyte in MDS-EB-2, IPSS high-risk, CD34+ 
cells >10%, and patients with CD34+CD7+ cell population and WT1 gene 
overexpression at intial diagnosis decreased significantly (P<0.05), and the 
percentage of NK cells and activated T cells increased significantly (P<0.05), 
but there was no significant difference in the ratio of B lymphocytes. Compared 
with the normal control group, the percentage of NK cells and activated T cells 
in IPSS-intermediate-2 group was significantly higher(P<0.05), but there was no 
significant difference in the percentage of CD3+T, CD4+T lymphocytes. The 
percentage of CD4+T cells in patients with complete remission after the first 
chemotherapy was significantly higher than in patients with incomplete 
remission(P<0.05), and the percentage of NK cells and activated T cells was 
significantly lower than that in patients with incomplete remission (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: In MDS patients, the proportion of CD3+T and CD4+T lymphocytes 
decreased, and the proportion of activated T cells increased, indicating that

livers of mice injected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or 
vehicle (Veh), we isolated RNA prior (RNA) or following metabolite extraction 
(MetRNA). RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data were evaluated for differential 
expression analysis and dispersion, and differential metabolite abundance was 
determined. Both RNA and MetRNA clustered together by principal component 
analysis, indicating that inter-individual differences were the largest source 
of variance. Over 85% of LCMV versus Veh differentially expressed genes were 
shared between extraction methods, with the remaining 15% evenly and randomly 
divided between groups. Differentially expressed genes unique to the extraction 
method were attributed to randomness around the 0.05 FDR cut-off and stochastic 
changes in variance and mean expression. In addition, analysis using the mean 
absolute difference showed no difference in the dispersion of transcripts 
between extraction methods. Altogether, our data show that prior metabolite 
extraction preserves RNAseq data quality, which enables us to confidently 
perform integrated pathway enrichment analysis on metabolomics and RNAseq data 
from a single sample. This analysis revealed pyrimidine metabolism as the most 
LCMV-impacted pathway. Combined analysis of genes and metabolites in the pathway 
exposed a pattern in the degradation of pyrimidine nucleotides leading to uracil 
generation. In support of this, uracil was among the most differentially 
abundant metabolites in serum upon LCMV infection. Our data suggest that hepatic 
uracil export is a novel phenotypic feature of acute infection and highlight the 
usefulness of our integrated single-sample multi-'omics approach.","DOI: 10.1080/15476286.2023.2204586

(#)Contributed equally","Dynamic Network Analysis (DyNA) and Dynamic Hypergraphs (DyHyp) were used to 
define protein-level inflammatory networks at the local (wound effluent) and 
systemic circulation (serum) levels from 140 active-duty, injured service 
members (59 with TBI and 81 non-TBI). Interleukin (IL)-17A was the only 
biomarker elevated significantly in both serum and effluent in TBI vs. non-TBI 
casualties, and the mediator with the most DyNA connections in TBI wounds. DyNA 
combining serum and effluent data to define cross-compartment correlations 
suggested that IL-17A bridges local and systemic circulation at late time

associated with tumor necrosis factor-α, while IL-17A downregulation in non-TBI 
patients was associated with interferon-γ. Correlation analysis suggested 
differential upregulation of pathogenic Th17 cells, non-pathogenic Th17 cells,

to accumulate sufficient biomass for cell proliferation. The protein synthesis 
is fueled by the amino acids transported from the environment. Steroid nuclear 
receptor coactivator 2 (SRC2) is a member of a family of transcription 
coactivators. Here, we show that SRC2 recruited by c-Myc enhances CD4+ T cell 
activation to stimulate immune responses via upregulation of amino acid 
transporter Slc7a5. Mice deficient of SRC2 in T cells (SRC2fl/fl/CD4Cre) are 
resistant to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 
and susceptible to Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium) infection. Adoptive 
transfer of naive CD4+ T cells from SRC2fl/fl/CD4Cre mice fails to elicit EAE 
and colitis in Rag1/ recipients. Further, CD4+ T cells from SRC2fl/fl/CD4Cre 
mice display defective T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and 
differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, SRC2 functions as a 
coactivator to work together with c-Myc to stimulate the expression of amino 
acid transporter Slc7a5 required for T cell activation. Slc7a5 fails to be 
up-regulated in CD4+ T cells from SRC2fl/fl/CD4Cre mice, and forced expression 
of Slc7a5 rescues proliferation, cytokine production, and the ability of 
SRC2fl/fl/CD4Cre CD4+ T cells to induce EAE. Therefore, SRC2 is essential for 
CD4+ T cell activation and, thus, a potential drug target for controlling CD4+ 
T cell-mediated autoimmunity.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2221352120

(miRNAs) in the development of regulatory T cell (Treg)/T helper 17 (Th17) cell 
imbalances in Behçet's uveitis (BU).
METHODS: The exosome treatment was conducted to evaluate the effects of plasma 
exosomes from patients with active BU and healthy controls on the Treg/Th17 cell 
balance. miRNA sequencing analysis of plasma exosomes was conducted to identify 
differentially expressed miRNAs between patients with active BU and healthy 
controls. miRTarBase analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted 
to identify the target genes of miR-19b-3p. CD4+T cells were transfected with 
miR-19b-3p mimic or inhibitor to evaluate its regulation of the Treg/Th17 cell 
balance. The Treg/Th17 cell balance in CD4+T cells was evaluated by flow 
cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Exosomes from patients with active BU promoted Th17 cell 
differentiation and inhibited Treg cell differentiation. MiRNA sequencing 
analysis revealed 177 upregulated and 274 downregulated miRNAs in plasma 
exosomes of patients with active BU. Among them, miR-19b-3p was significantly 
elevated, and its target genes were identified as being involved in T-cell 
differentiation. miR-19b-3p overexpression downregulated CD46 expression and the 
Treg/Th17 cell ratio in CD4+T cells from healthy controls, whereas miR-19b-3p 
inhibition reversed these regulatory effects and restored the Treg/Th17 cell 
balance of CD4+T cells from patients with active BU.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma-derived exosomes from patients with active BU showed a 
markedly differential miRNA expression in comparison to healthy controls. Highly 
expressed miRNA-19b-3p could induce a Treg/Th17 cell imbalance, probably by 
downregulating CD46 expression.","DOI: 10.1167/iovs.64.4.28

hepatitis B virus (HBV) worldwide. HBV infection can develop into liver 
fibrosis. The mechanism of HBV-related liver fibrosis has not been fully 
understood, and there are few effective treatment options. The goal of this 
study was to use transcriptomics in conjunction with experimental validation to 
identify new targets to treat HBV-related liver fibrosis. Methods: To identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), five liver tissues were collected from 
both healthy individuals and patients with chronic hepatitis B. NovoMagic and 
Java GSEA were used to screen DEGs and key genes, respectively. Immunocell 
infiltration analysis of RNA-seq data was, and the results were confirmed by 
Western blotting (WB), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR), and immunohistochemistry. Results: We evaluated 1,105 genes with 
differential expression, and 462 and 643 genes showed down- and upregulation, 
respectively. The essential genes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), were screened out of DEGs. TRAF2

bilirubin (TBIL) were positively linked with TRAF2 expression. TRAF2 may be 
crucial in controlling T lymphocyte-mediated liver fibrosis. Conclusion: Our

that presents with mass lesions in the lung. It is radiologically difficult to 
differentiate it from adenocarcinoma of the lung or pulmonary lymphoma. There 
has been no consensus regarding the treatment of PNLH; however, in many case 
series, patients usually undergo surgical resection for diagnostic and 
therapeutic purposes. Here, we present the case of a 60-year-old Chinese male 
who presented with cough and hemoptysis. A computed tomography scan of the 
thorax revealed a mass-like lesion. A biopsy was performed which showed 
lymphocytic pneumonitis. He was treated with a tapering dose of corticosteroids 
with good clinical and radiological outcomes. Upon a subsequent review of the 
case, a diagnosis of PNLH was made. This case report suggests that 
corticosteroids may be an alternative therapy to surgical resection. They have 
the advantage of being non-invasive and can be used in patients who are 
otherwise not surgical candidates due to other comorbidities. However, further 
research is required before we can recommend corticosteroids as a treatment for 
PNLH.","Copyright © 2023, Goh et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.37870

mortality and morbidity. Circulating leukocyte counts, which serve as a 
biomarker for assessing systemic immune status, have been linked to arrhythmias 
in observational studies. However, observational studies are plagued by 
confounding factors and reverse causality, whether alterations in circulating 
leukocyte components are causally associated with arrhythmias remains uncertain. 
The present study explored this question based on genetic evidence.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to 
evaluate whether alterations in leukocyte counts affect aggregated risk of all 
types of arrhythmia or risk of five specific types of arrhythmia. 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms serving as proxies for leukocyte differential 
counts were retrieved from the Blood Cell Consortium, and statistical data on 
arrhythmias were obtained from the UK Biobank), FinnGenand a meta-analysis of 
genome-wide association studies for atrial fibrillation. We applied inverse 
variance-weighted method as the primary analysis, complemented by a series of 
sensitivity analyses. Bidirectional analyses were conducted to assess reverse 
causality. Finally, multivariable MR was performed to study the joint effects of 
multiple risk factors. We found that genetically predicted differential 
leukocyte counts were not significantly associated with aggregated occurrence of 
all types of arrhythmia. In contrast, each 1-standard deviation increase in 
lymphocyte count was associated with 46% higher risk of atrioventricular block 
(OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11-1.93, p=0.0065). A similar effect size was observed across 
all MR sensitivity analyses, with no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. Reverse 
MR analysis suggested that atrioventricular block was unlikely to cause changes 
in lymphocyte count. Primary MR analysis based on the inverse-variance weighted 
method suggested that changes in neutrophil count alter risk of right bundle 
branch block, and changes in basophil count alter risk of atrial fibrillation. 
However, these causal relationships were not robust in sensitivity analyses. We 
found no compelling evidence that neutrophil or lymphocyte counts cause atrial 
fibrillation.
CONCLUSION: Our data support higher lymphocyte count as a causal risk factor for 
atrioventricular block. These results highlight the importance of immune cells 
in the pathogenesis of specific cardiac conduction disorders.","Copyright © 2023 Chen, Lou, Zhang, Jin, Chen, Chen, Li, Zhang, Fu, Hu and Yang.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1041591

tumor microenvironment, play a critical role in the antitumor immune response. 
Few studies have developed a prognostic model based on TILs in osteosarcoma.
METHODS: ScRNA-seq data was obtained from our previous research and bulk RNA 
transcriptome data was from TARGET database. WGCNA was used to obtain the 
immune-related gene modules. Subsequently, we applied LASSO regression analysis 
and SVM algorithm to construct a prognostic model based on TILs marker genes. 
What's more, the prognostic model was verified by external datasets and 
experiment in vitro.
RESULTS: Eleven cell clusters and 2044 TILs marker genes were identified. WGCNA 
results showed that 545 TILs marker genes were the most strongly related with 
immune. Subsequently, a risk model including 5 genes was developed. We found 
that the survival rate was higher in the low-risk group and the risk model could 
be used as an independent prognostic factor. Meanwhile, high-risk patients had a 
lower abundance of immune cell infiltration and many immune checkpoint genes 
were highly expressed in the low-risk group. The prognostic model was also 
demonstrated to be a good predictive capacity in external datasets. The result 
of RT-qPCR indicated that these 5 genes have differential expression which 
accorded with the predicting outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a new molecular signature based on TILs marker 
genes, which is very effective in predicting OS prognosis and immunotherapy 
response.","Copyright © 2023 Tang, Liu, Luo, Sun, Li, Luo, Liao, Li, Liang, Zhan, Wei, Liu

of prognostic outcomes in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. This 
meta-analysis provided updated evidence on the association of controlling 
nutritional status (CONUT) score with survival and other clinicopathological 
outcomes in patients with gastric cancer. PubMed and Scopus databases were 
systematically searched. The review included studies, observational in design, 
that were conducted among patients with gastric cancer and had documented the 
association of CONUT score with outcomes of interest. The primary outcomes of 
interest were overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) along with tumour size and extent (T status), 
nodal status (N status) and tumour staging (TNM staging). STATA was used for 
statistical analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted with 17 studies. The 
5-year OS [hazard ratio (HR), 1.75; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.55, 1.96], 
RFS (HR, 1.58; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.91) and CSS (HR, 1.89; 95% CI: 1.01, 3.52) were 
comparatively poorer in the high CONUT group, than in low CONUT group. High 
CONUT score was associated with increased risk of having T3/T4 tumour [odds 
ratio (OR), 1.64; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.34], N2/N3 nodal status (OR, 1.44; 95% CI:

Although some studies have analyzed the mechanism of T-MPs as tumor vaccine, we 
still lack understanding of how T-MPs stimulate a strong anti-tumor immune 
response. Here, we show that T-MPs induce macrophages to release a key 
chemotactic factor CCL2, which attracts monocytes to the vaccine injection site 
and enhances endocytosis of antigen. Monocytes subsequently enter the draining 
lymph node, and differentiate into monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), which present 
tumor antigens to T lymphocytes and deliver a potent anti-tumor immune response. 
Mechanically, T-MPs activate the cGAS-STING signaling through DNA fragments, and 
then induce monocytes to upregulate the expression of IRF4, which is a key 
factor for monocyte differentiation into moDCs. More importantly, monocytes that 
have endocytosed T-MPs acquire the ability to treat tumors. Collectively, this 
work might provide novel vaccination strategy for the development of tumor 
vaccines and facilitate the application of T-MPs for clinic oncotherapy.

carcinoma, and its expression level increased as cells became more 
differentiated. Using CRISPR-mediated knockdown, we found that the absence of 
CD51 led to a lower number of virus-specific CD8 T cells upon chronic 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, although their granzyme B 
expression and cytokine production were maintained. Blocking CD51 also inhibited

Biomodulina T stimulates the thymus gland and, thus, promotes the recovery of 
normal thymus size in children with thymic hypoplasia and restores the functions 
of immunosenescent T cells in aging people. In 1984 Rodriguez Martin RR 
established the laboratory of Biomodulators, where he created and developed an 
immunomodulatory thymic factor that he named ""Biomodulina T."" The biological 
activity of Biomodulina T was demonstrated in several studies. An extensive 
series of preclinical toxicological studies were conducted and these studies 
demonstrated that Biomodulina T is an active and safe thymic factor. Clinical 
trials were conducted with Biomodulina T in patients with immunodeficiency and 
infections, autoimmune diseases, older adults with recurrent respiratory 
infections, and cancer. In 1994, we obtained the approval of Biomodulina T as an 
immunomodulatory drug. This article identifies the milestones involved in the 
development of Biomodulina T. Since its discovery more than 35 years ago, 
reports show that Biomodulina T is a modulator of immune response and 
inflammation that is very useful for restoring the immune system in young and 
elderly people with immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and infections.

no pathognomonic symptoms or signs and a wide range of differential diagnoses. 
The aim of this report is to present the pathological features of our group of 
patients, obtained through a systematic diagnostic approach. This retrospective 
cohort study enrolled all adult patients primarily diagnosed with 
neurosarcoidosis at the neurology department of a tertiary center in Sweden over 
a period of 30 years, from 1990 to 2021. We identified 90 patients, 54 with 
possible neurosarcoidosis and 36 with probable neurosarcoidosis. CNS biopsy 
revealed an alternative diagnosis for 24 patients, who were then excluded. The 
collected data from medical records included demographic and clinical 
characteristics, systemic and/or neurological isolated involvement, various 
laboratory tests, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum analysis, imaging 
studies (MRI, FDG-PET/CT, and HRCT), nerve conduction studies, electromyography, 
and pathology reports of central nervous system (CNS), and extra-neural tissue 
biopsies. Sixty-six patients were included in our cohort. The median age at 
onset of symptoms was 49 years, with a similar sex distribution. Cranial 
neuropathies (38%), motor deficit (32%), headache (16%), and pituitary 
dysfunction (12%) were the most common presenting features. CSF studies were 
abnormal in 77% of the patients, who showed lymphocytosis (57%), elevated 
protein (44%), oligoclonal bands (40%), elevated ACE (28%), and raised T 
lymphocyte CD4+/CD8+ ratios (13%). Strikingly, MRI showed that 17% of the 
patients presented with isolated pituitary gland lesions. FDG-PET/CT was 
performed in 22 patients (33%) and confirmed systemic sarcoidosis in 11. Despite 
our extensive workup, the final classification for our patients only allowed for 
a definite diagnosis in 14 patients; the remainder were classified as probable 
(32) or possible (20) neurosarcoidosis. Since 2007, the employment of a 
structured laboratory and imaging approach and the increasing number of CNS 
biopsies have facilitated and improved the process of correct attribution in 
patients with presumptive neurosarcoidosis, especially in patients with isolated 
neurological lesions. We highlight a higher frequency of pituitary lesions due 
to neurosarcoidosis than has been classically described. A detailed laboratory

determined by cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) analysis between active 
tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI). In this study, we performed 
CyTOF analysis using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to compare the 
differential immune cellular profile between active TB and LTBI. A total of 51 
subjects (active TB [n = 34] and LTBI [n = 17]) were included. CyTOF analysis of 
16 subjects (active TB [n = 8] and LTBI [n = 8]) identified a significantly 
higher Th17-like cell population in active TB than in LTBI. This finding was 
validated in the remaining 35 subjects (active TB [n = 26] and LTBI [n = 9]) 
using flow cytometry analysis, which consistently reveals a higher percentage of 
Th17 cell population in active TB (p = 0.032). The Th1/Th17 ratio represented 
good ability to discriminate between active TB and LTBI (AUC = 0.812). Among 
patients with active TB, the Th17 cell percentage was found to be lower in more 
advanced forms of the disease. Additionally, Th17 cell percentage positively 
correlated with the levels of IL-6 and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, 
respectively. In conclusion, CyTOF analysis of PBMCs showed a significantly 
higher percentage of Th17 cells in active TB although fairly similar immune cell 
populations between active TB and LTBI were observed.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.tube.2023.102344

state-of-the-art digital morphology analyzers. We explored the performance of 
EasyCell assistant in comparison with manual microscopic review and Pentra DX 
Nexus (Horiba ABX Diagnostics, Montpellier, France).
METHODS: In a total of 225 samples (100 normal and 125 abnormal samples), white 
blood cell (WBC) differentials and platelet (PLT) count estimation by EasyCell 
assistant were compared with the results by manual microscopic review and Pentra 
DX Nexus. The manual microscopic review was performed according to the Clinical 
and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (H20-A2).
RESULTS: WBC differentials between pre-classification by EasyCell assistant and 
manual counting showed moderate correlations for neutrophils (r=0.58), 
lymphocytes (r=0.69), and eosinophils (r=0.51) in all samples. After user 
verification, they showed mostly high to very high correlations for neutrophils 
(r=0.74), lymphocytes (r=0.78), eosinophils (r=0.88), and other cells (r=0.91). 
PLT count by EasyCell assistant highly correlated with that by Pentra DX Nexus 
(r=0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of EasyCell assistant for WBC differentials and PLT 
count seems to be acceptable even in abnormal samples with improvement after 
user verification. The EasyCell assistant, with its reliable performance on WBC 
differentials and PLT count, would help optimize the workflow of hematology 
laboratories with reduced workload of manual microscopic review.","© 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","DOI: 10.1515/cclm-2023-0100

DCs (imDCs) reportedly sense infections, while mature DCs (mDCs) move quickly to 
lymph nodes to deliver antigens to T cells. However, their highly heterogeneous

machine learning (ML) approach to analyze long-term, two-dimensional migration 
trajectories of Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF)-derived 
bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). We discovered three migratory modes independent

fast-persistent (FP). Remarkably, imDCs more frequently changed their modes, 
predominantly following a unicyclic SD→FP→SP→SD transition, whereas mDCs showed 
no transition directionality. We report that DC migration exhibits a 
history-dependent mode transition and maturation-dependent motility changes are 
emergent properties of the dynamic switching of the three migratory modes. Our

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Sepsis can result in acute lung injury (ALI). Studies have shown 
that pharmacological inhibition of ferroptosis can treat ALI. However, the 
regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in sepsis-induced ALI remain unclear.
METHODS: Transcriptome sequencing was performed on lung tissue samples from 10 
sepsis-induced mouse models of ALI and 10 control mice. After quality control 
measures, clean data were used to screen for differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) between the groups. The DEGs were then overlapped with 
ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) to obtain ferroptosis-related DEGs (FR-DEGs). 
Subsequently, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and 
Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) were used to 
obtain key genes. In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was employed to 
explore the disease, function, and canonical pathways related to the key genes. 
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the functions of the 
key genes, and regulatory miRNAs of key genes were predicted using the 
NetworkAnalyst and StarBase databases. Finally, the expression of key genes was 
validated with the GSE165226 and GSE168796 datasets sourced from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and using quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
RESULTS: Thirty-three FR-DEGs were identified between 1843 DEGs and 259 FRGs. 
Three key genes, Ncf2, Steap3, and Gclc, were identified based on diagnostic 
models established by the two machine learning methods. They are mainly involved 
in infection, immunity, and apoptosis, including lymphatic system cell migration 
and lymphocyte and T cell responses. Additionally, the GSEA suggested that Ncf2 
and Steap3 were similarly enriched in mRNA processing, response to peptides, and 
leukocyte differentiation. Furthermore, a key gene-miRNA network including 2 key 
genes (Steap3 and Gclc) and 122 miRNAs, and a gene-miRNA network with 1 key gene 
(Steap3) and 3 miRNAs were constructed using NetworkAnalyst and StarBase, 
respectively. Both databases predicted that mmu-miR-15a-5p was the target miRNA 
of Steap3. Finally, Ncf2 expression was validated using both datasets and 
qRT-PCR, and Steap3 was validated using GSE165226 and qRT-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two FR-DEGs (Ncf2 and Steap3) associated with 
sepsis-induced ALI via transcriptome analyses, as well as their functional and 
metabolic pathways.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12890-023-02361-3

marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZL), and in lymphomas arising from TFH-cells, 
sometimes making the differential diagnosis difficult. In the skin, the 
""TFH-spectrum"" is poorly defined, going from primary cutaneous 
lymphoproliferative disorder with small/medium CD4+ T-cells (SMLPD) to cutaneous 
localizations of systemic angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (cAITL), and may 
pass through intermediate forms (primary cutaneous T-follicular helper derived 
lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PCTFHL,NOS)). We retrospectively analyzed 20 
MZL, 13 SMLPD, 5 PCTFHL, and 11 cAITL clinically, histologically, and 
molecularly, to define tools to differentiate them. Characteristics that might 
favor the diagnosis of MZL over SMLPD are: multiple skin nodules (p < 0.001), 
nodular architecture (p < 0.01), residual germinal centers with follicular 
dendritic cell network (p < 0.001), monotypic plasma cells (p < 0.001), and few 
staining with PD1 (p = 0.016) or CXCL13 (p = 0.03). PCTFHL and cAITL presented 
as multiple (p < 0.01) lesions, in older patients (p < 0.01), with systemic 
symptoms and/or biological alterations (p < 0.01). Immunophenotypic loss of 
T-cell markers (p < 0.001), BCL6 (p = 0.023) and/or CD10 staining (p = 0.08), 
and a higher proliferative index (≥ 30%, p = 0.039) favoured these diagnoses 
over SMLPD. Pathogenic variants were observed by genomic sequencing in 47% of 
MZL (TNFAIP3 (32%), EP300 (21%), NOTCH2 (16%), KMT2D (16%), CARD11 (10.5%)), 8%

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) varies depending on comorbidities. This 
study evaluated the clinical and immunological factors affecting the humoral 
response of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the BNT162b2 
vaccine.
METHODS: Humoral immunity was evaluated in 54 ESRD patients using serum levels 
of anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), 
measured by a chemiluminescent immunoassay 30 (T1), 60 (T2), and 120 (T3) days 
after the second vaccine dose. The results were correlated to baseline patient 
T- and B-lymphocyte subpopulations determined by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The proportion of seroconverted patients based on the NAb titer 
decreased from 83.3% at T1 to 53.7% at T3. Age was negatively correlated to the 
NAb titer at T1 and T2. Patients receiving hemodiafiltration had higher NAb 
titers at T3. Diabetes was associated with a lower response rate at T3. 
Univariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between the naïve CD4 
T-lymphocyte population and RBD titer at T1 and the NAb titer at T3, with no 
association observed with naïve CD8 T lymphocytes. NAb titers at T3 were 
significantly correlated with late-differentiated CD4 T lymphocytes and 
terminally differentiated effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) CD8 
T lymphocytes. RBD levels were positively correlated with naïve and memory 
B-lymphocyte counts at T3.
CONCLUSIONS: Age, diabetes, and hemodialysis prescription had significant 
impacts on the response to vaccination. T- and B-lymphocyte phenotypes are major 
determinants of the humoral response potency to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with 
BNT162b2 in patients with ESRD.","DOI: 10.3343/alm.2023.43.5.451

generally occurs in the upper respiratory tract. T helper type 2 (Th2) 
cell-mediated cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, are 
important factors in AR pathogenesis. Despite various treatment options, the 
difficulty in alleviating AR and pharmacological side effects necessitate 
development of new therapies. The root of Pulsatilla koreana Nakai (P. koreana), 
a pasque flower, has been used as a herbal medicine. However, its effects on AR 
remain unclear; therefore, we aimed to explore this subject in the current 
study. The therapeutic effects of P. koreana water extract (PKN) on the 
pathophysiological functions of the nasal mucosa was examined in ovalbumin 
(OVA)-induced AR mice. The effect of PKN on Th2 activation and differentiation 
was evaluated using concanavalin A-induced splenocytes and differentiated Th2 
cells from naïve CD4+ T cells. We also investigated the effect of changes in 
JAK/STAT6/GATA3 signaling on IL-4-induced Th2 cells. In OVA-induced AR mice, PKN 
administration alleviated allergic nasal symptoms and decreased the total number 
of immune cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils in nasal lavage 
fluid; serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, histamine, and IL-13 were also 
significantly reduced. PKN also ameliorated OVA-induced nasal mucosal tissue 
thickening by inhibiting inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia. PKN treatment 
significantly inhibited Th2 activity and differentiation through the 
IL-4/STAT-6/GATA3 pathway in Th2 cells. PKN is an effective AR treatment with 
the potential to improve patients' daily lives by regulating the allergic 
inflammatory response induced by Th2 cells.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights

uncommitted progenitors. The earliest stage of T cell development is known as 
CD4-CD8- double negative 1 (DN1), which has previously been shown to be a 
heterogenous mixture of cells. Of these, only the CD117+ fraction has been 
proposed to be true T cell progenitors that progress to the DN2 and DN3 
thymocyte stages, at which point the development of the αβ and γδ T cell 
lineages diverge. However, recently, it has been shown that at least some γδ T 
cells may be derived from a subset of CD117- DN thymocytes. Along with other 
ambiguities, this suggests that T cell development may not be as straightforward 
as previously thought. To better understand early T cell development, 
particularly the heterogeneity of DN1 thymocytes, we performed a single cell RNA 
sequence (scRNAseq) of mouse DN and γδ thymocytes and show that the various DN 
stages indeed comprise a transcriptionally diverse subpopulations of cells. We 
also show that multiple subpopulations of DN1 thymocytes exhibit preferential 
development towards the γδ lineage. Furthermore, specific γδ-primed DN1 
subpopulations preferentially develop into IL-17 or IFNγ-producing γδ T cells. 
We show that DN1 subpopulations that only give rise to IL-17-producing γδ T 
cells already express many of the transcription factors associated with type 17 
immune cell responses, while the DN1 subpopulations that can give rise to 
IFNγ-producing γδ T cell already express transcription factors associated with 
type 1 immune cell responses.","Copyright © 2023 Oh, Liu, Tomei, Luo, Skinner, Berzins, Naik, Gray and Chong.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1106652

activated T cells that emerges in response to persistent viral infection or 
tumor antigens. Tex cells showed the characteristics of aging cells, including 
weakened self-renewal ability, effector function inhibition, sustained high 
expression of inhibitory receptors including PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, and LAG-3, and 
always accompanied by metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. Tex cells are 
getting more and more attention in researching immune-related diseases and tumor 
immunotherapy. However, studies on Tex-related models for tumor prognosis are 
still lacking. We hope to establish a risk model based on Tex-related genes for 
HCC prognosis.
METHODS: Tex-related GEO datasets from different pathologic factors (chronic 
HBV, chronic HCV, and telomere shortening) were analyzed respectively to acquire 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by the 'limma' package of R. Genes with at 
least one intersection were incorporated into Tex-related gene set. GO, KEGG, 
and GSEA enrichment analyses were produced. Hub genes and the PPI network were 
established and visualized by the STRING website and Cytoscape software. 
Transcription factors and targeting small molecules were predicted by the TRUST 
and CLUE websites. The Tex-related HCC prognostic model was built by Cox 
regression and verified based on different datasets. Tumor immune dysfunction 
and exclusion (TIDE) and SubMap algorithms tested immunotherapy sensitivity. 
Finally, qRT-PCR and Flow Cytometry was used to confirm the bioinformatic 
results.
RESULTS: Hub genes such as AKT1, CDC6, TNF and their upstream transcription 
factor ILF3, Regulatory factor X-associated protein, STAT3, JUN, and RELA/NFKB1 
were identified as potential motivators for Tex. Tex-related genes SLC16A11, 
CACYBP, HSF2, and ATG10 built the HCC prognostic model and helped with 
Immunotherapy sensitivity prediction.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that Tex-related genes might provide accurate 
prediction for HCC patients in clinical decision-making, prognostic assessment, 
and immunotherapy. In addition, targeting the hub genes or transcription factors 
may help to reverse T cell function and enhance the effect of tumor 
immunotherapy.","Copyright © 2023 Shi, Li, Liu, Yuan, Wang, Gong, Li, Ge and Lu.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1166052

effector lymphocytes with a cytotoxic and tissue migration phenotype. The 
frequent redistribution of these cells is purported to increase immune 
surveillance and play a mechanistic role in reducing cancer risk and slowing 
tumor progression in physically active cancer survivors. Our aim was to provide 
the first detailed single cell transcriptomic analysis of exercise-mobilized 
lymphocytes and test their effectiveness as a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in 
xenogeneic mice engrafted with human leukemia.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from healthy 
volunteers at rest and at the end of an acute bout of cycling exercise. Flow 
cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify phenotypic 
and transcriptomic differences between resting and exercise-mobilized cells 
using a targeted gene expression panel curated for human immunology. PBMCs were 
injected into the tail vein of xenogeneic NSG-IL-15 mice and subsequently 
challenged with a luciferase tagged chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line 
(K562). Tumor growth (bioluminescence) and xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease 
(GvHD) were monitored bi-weekly for 40-days.
RESULTS: Exercise preferentially mobilized NK-cell, CD8+ T-cell and monocyte 
subtypes with a differentiated and effector phenotype, without significantly 
mobilizing CD4+ regulatory T-cells. Mobilized effector lymphocytes, particularly 
effector-memory CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells, displayed differentially expressed 
genes and enriched gene sets associated with anti-tumor activity, including 
cytotoxicity, migration/chemotaxis, antigen binding, cytokine responsiveness and 
alloreactivity (e.g. graft-versus-host/leukemia). Mice receiving 
exercise-mobilized PBMCs had lower tumor burden and higher overall survival 
(4.14E+08 photons/s and 47%, respectively) at day 40 compared to mice receiving 
resting PBMCs (12.1E+08 photons/s and 22%, respectively) from the same donors 
(p<0.05). Human immune cell engraftment was similar for resting and 
exercise-mobilized DLI. However, when compared to non-tumor bearing mice, K562 
increased the expansion of NK-cell and CD3+/CD4-/CD8- T-cells in mice receiving 
exercise-mobilized but not resting lymphocytes, 1-2 weeks after DLI. No 
differences in GvHD or GvHD-free survival was observed between groups either 
with or without K562 challenge.
CONCLUSION: Exercise in humans mobilizes effector lymphocytes with an anti-tumor 
transcriptomic profile and their use as DLI extends survival and enhances the 
graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect without exacerbating GvHD in human leukemia 
bearing xenogeneic mice. Exercise may serve as an effective and economical 
adjuvant to increase the GvL effects of allogeneic cell therapies without 
intensifying GvHD.","Copyright © 2023 Batatinha, Diak, Niemiro, Baker, Smith, Zúñiga, Mylabathula,

leading cause of cancer-related death. As a chronic liver disease, many studies 
have shown that the immune response plays a key role in the progression of liver 
cancer. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the high-risk 
factors for HCC, accounting for 50%-80% of HCC cases worldwide, and little is 
known about the immune status of HBV associated hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HBV-HCC), therefore, we aimed to explore the changes in peripheral immunity in 
patients with HBV-HCC.
METHODS: In this study, patients with HBV-HCC (n=26), patients with hepatitis 
B-related cirrhosis (HBV-LC) (n=31) and healthy volunteers (n=49) were included. 
The lymphocytes and their subpopulation phenotypes in peripheral blood were 
characterized. In addition, we explored the effect of viral replication on 
peripheral immunity in patients with HCC and analyzed the circulating 
immunophenotypic characteristics at different stages of HCC with flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Firstly, our results showed that the percentages of total αβ T cells in 
the peripheral blood of HBV-HCC patients was significantly decreased compared to 
healthy subjects. Secondly, we found that naïve CD4+ T cells in HBV-HCC patients 
were significantly reduced, terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells, homing 
memory CD8+ T cells and Th2 cells were increased in peripheral circulation in 
HBV-HCC patients. Moreover, in the peripheral blood of HBV-HCC patients, 
expression of TIGIT on CD4+ T cells and PD-1 on the surface of Vδ 1 T cells was 
increased. In addition, we found that sustained viral replication resulted in 
up-regulation of TIM3 expression on CD4+ T cells, and TIM3+ γδ T cells increased 
in peripheral circulation in patients with advanced HBV-HCC.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that circulating lymphocytes in HBV-HCC patients 
exhibited features of immune exhaustion, especially in HCC patients with 
persistent viral replication and in patients with intermediate and advanced 
HBV-HCC, including decreased frequency of T cells and elevated expression of 
inhibitory receptors including TIGIT and TIM3 on CD4+ T cells and γδ T cells. 
Meanwhile, our research suggests that the combination of CD3+ T cell and 
CD8+HLADR+CD38+ T cell may be a potential diagnostic indicator for HBV-HCC. 
These findings could help us to better understand the immune characteristics of 
HBV-HCC and explore the immune mechanisms and immunotherapy strategies for 
HBV-HCC.","Copyright © 2023 Sun, Li, Lin, Yang, Liu, Lan, Xiao, Deng, Yin, Xu, Xiang and

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: A common complication of sepsis is acute lung injury (ALI), which is 
associated with an acute onset, rapid disease changes, and high mortality. 
Regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells comprise CD4+ T cell subsets, 
which strongly influence inflammation during ALI. In this study, we investigated 
the effect of berberine (BBR), an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
immunomodulatory drug, on the inflammatory response and immune state in mice 
with sepsis.
METHODS: A mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was established. The 
mice were intragastrically administered 50 mg/kg BBR. We used histological 
techniques to evaluate inflammatory tissue injury and flow cytometry for 
analyzing Treg/Th17 levels. We also assessed NF-κB signaling pathways by Western 
blotting assays and immunofluorescence staining. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the content of cytokines.
RESULTS: Treatment with BBR considerably mitigated lung injury while improving 
survival, post-cecal ligation, and puncture (CLP). Treatment with BBR 
ameliorated pulmonary edema and hypoxemia in septic mice and inhibited the NF-κB 
signaling pathway. BBR also increased Treg cells and decreased Th17 proportions 
in the spleen and lung tissue of CLP-treated mice. Blocking Treg cells weakened 
the protective effect of BBR on sepsis-associated lung injury.
CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggested that BBR is a potential therapeutic 
agent for sepsis.",© 2023 Chen et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S401293

MSCs as an alternative to fetal bovine serum since it is relatively inexpensive. 
Fetal calf serum is fortified with iron since calves are often fed a low-iron

cells by releasing perforin-containing cytotoxic granules at the immunological 
synapse. The secretion of such granules depends on Ca2+-influx through store 
operated Ca2+ channels, formed by STIM (stromal interaction molecule)-activated 
Orai proteins. Whereas molecular mechanisms of the secretion machinery are well 
understood, much less is known about the molecular machinery that regulates the 
efficiency of Ca2+-dependent target cell killing. CTL killing efficiency is of 
high interest considering the number of studies on CD8+ T lymphocytes modified 
for clinical use. Here, we isolated total RNA from primary human cells: natural 
killer (NK) cells, non-stimulated CD8+ T-cells, and from Staphylococcus aureus 
enterotoxin A (SEA) stimulated CD8+ T-cells (SEA-CTL) and conducted whole genome 
expression profiling by microarray experiments. Based on differential expression 
analysis of the transcriptome data and analysis of master regulator genes, we 
identified 31 candidates which potentially regulate Ca2+-homeostasis in CTL. To 
investigate a putative function of these candidates in CTL cytotoxicity, we 
transfected either SEA-stimulated CTL (SEA-CTL) or antigen specific CD8+ T-cell 
clones (CTL-MART-1) with siRNAs specific against the identified candidates and 
analyzed the killing capacity using a real-time killing assay. In addition, we 
complemented the analysis by studying the effect of inhibitory substances acting 
on the candidate proteins if available. Finally, to unmask their involvement in 
Ca2+ dependent cytotoxicity, candidates were also analyzed under Ca2+-limiting 
conditions. Overall, we identified four hits, CCR5 (C-C chemokine receptor type 
five), KCNN4 (potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N), RCAN3 (regulator

(#)Contributed equally","Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of acute kidney 
injury (AKI), and experimental work has revealed detailed insight into the 
inflammatory response in the kidney. T cells and NFκB pathway play an important 
role in IRI. Therefore, we examined the regulatory role and mechanisms of 
IkappaB kinase 1 (IKK1) in CD4+T lymphocytes in an experimental model of IRI. 
IRI was induced in CD4cre and CD4IKK1Δ mice. Compared to control mice, 
conditional deficiency of IKK1 in CD4+T lymphocyte significantly decreased serum 
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, and renal tubular injury score. 
Mechanistically, lack in IKK1 in CD4+T lymphocytes reduced the ability of CD4 
lymphocytes to differentiate into Th1/Th17 cells. Similar to IKK1 gene ablation, 
pharmacological inhibition of IKK also protected mice from IRI. Together, 
lymphocyte IKK1 plays a pivotal role in IRI by promoting T cells differentiation 
into Th1/Th17 and targeting lymphocyte IKK1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy 
for IRI.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00018-023-04763-2

rare disease with an extensive range of known causative agents. LH is further 
classified into ""reactive"" (RLH) and ""atypical"" (ALH) types. It clinically 
presents as a single or a few plaques and/or nodular lesions, particularly on 
the head, neck, and upper trunk. It must be differentiated from orbital 
malignant lymphoma. In this report, we present a case of a 58-year-old Pakistani 
female with an asymptomatic recurrent right periorbital swelling for three 
years. It was clinically diagnosed as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor-induced angioedema as it responded to stopping the ACE inhibitor; 
however, after four months, the patient again started to develop right 
periorbital swelling. An incisional biopsy revealed perivascular and periadnexal 
infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and a few neutrophils along with 
pigmentary incontinence. The formation of multiple lymphoid follicles and 
infiltration by monomorphic lymphoid cells in deeper skeletal muscle fibers were 
also observed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed polyclonality and low Ki-67 
labeling (20%), corresponding to periorbital RLH. Our objective in this study is 
to highlight the importance of considering PSL as a differential diagnosis in 
periorbital swelling. We also suggest that recurrent angioedema may lead to PSL.","Copyright © 2023, Subhan et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.36270

classification of T lymphocyte subsets. We notice that genes encoding CD3, 
co-receptors CD4 and CD8 have been cloned in several fish species and antibodies 
have been developed to study protein expression in morphological and functional 
contexts. T lymphocytes can be divided into CD4+ and CD8+ cells discriminated by 
the expression of CD4 and CD8 molecules in teleost, which are functionally 
similar to mammalian helper T cells (Th) and cytotoxic T cells (Tc),

neoplastic B lymphocytes in the vascular space. Since conventional computed 
tomography (CT) shows nonspecific findings, differentiation between IVLBCL and 
other lung diseases, such as diffuse interstitial lung disease, is difficult.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man presented with dyspnea and hypoxemia. 
Laboratory findings showed an increased lactate dehydrogenase level of 1690 U/L 
(normal: 130-235 U/L) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor level of 1140 U/mL 
(normal: 157-474U/mL). Dual-energy CT iodine mapping showed a significant 
symmetrical decrease in iodine distribution in the upper lungs, suggesting an 
unusual distribution of pulmonary hypoperfusion. Therefore, IVLBCL was 
suspected. A random skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of IVLBCL. Due to the 
severity of the disease, lung biopsy was averted. After admission to the 
hospital, high-dose methotrexate was administered for central nervous system 
involvement, due to findings of suspected intracranial infiltration on a brain 
magnetic resonance imaging and elevated cell counts on lumbar puncture. 
Subsequently, oxygen demand improved, and rituximab along with cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone was added to the patient's regime. 
Eventually, oxygen administration was terminated, the patient's general 
condition improved, and the patient was discharged after 47 days of 
hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Since the diagnosis of IVLBCL depends on whether it is possible to 
suspect IVLBCL, the finding of decreased iodine perfusion demonstrated on 
dual-energy CT is considered important information for diagnosis. An immediate 
diagnosis of IVLBCL is needed to avoid rapid disease progression and introduce 
early treatment for a favorable prognosis. In this case, unique pulmonary 
hypoperfusion demonstrated by dual-energy CT promoted early diagnosis of IVLBCL.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12890-023-02420-9

However, we observe that initial CCR7-mediated localization of CD8 T cells to 
tumor draining lymph nodes is required to subsequently generate CD103+ CD8 T 
cells in tumors. We observe that the formation of CD103+ CD8 T cells in tumors 
is dependent on CD40L but independent of CD4 T cells, and using mixed chimeras 
we show that CD8 T cells can provide their own CD40L to permit CD103+ CD8 T cell 
differentiation. Finally, we show that CD40L is required to provide systemic 
protection against secondary tumors. These data suggest that CD103+ CD8 T cell

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) is an organized infiltration of 
immune cells, showing features of germinal center (GC) commonly seen in 
secondary lymphoid organs. However, its relationship with tumor-draining lymph 
nodes (TDLNs) has not been studied and we hypothesized that TDLN may influence 
maturation of intratumoral TLS in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Tissue slides of 616 patients that had undergone surgeries were 
examined. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to assess risk 
factors of patients' survival, and logistic regression model was used for their 
relationship with TLS. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to 
explore transcriptomic features of TDLNs. Immunohistochemistry, multiplex 
immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were performed to analyze cellular 
composition. Cellular components of NSCLC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
database were inferred with Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter 
(MCP-counter) method. Murine NSCLC models were used to dissect underlying 
mechanisms for relationship between TDLN and TLS maturation.
RESULTS: While GC+ TLS was associated with better prognosis, GC- TLS was not. 
TDLN metastasis reduced the prognostic relevance of TLS, and was associated with 
less GC formation. Primary tumor sites showed reduced B cell infiltration in 
TDLN-positive patients, and scRNA-seq revealed diminished memory B cell 
formation in tumor-invaded TDLNs, together with an emphasis on weakened 
interferon (IFN)-γ response. Murine NSCLC models revealed that IFN-γ signaling 
is involved in memory B cell differentiation in TDLNs and GC formation in 
primary tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research emphasizes the influence of TDLN on intratumoral TLS 
maturation and suggests a role of memory B cells and IFN-γ signaling in this 
communication.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

differentiated thyroid carcinoma(DTC). Tumor antigens stimulate the expression 
of PD-1 in immune cells, which binds to PD-L1 of tumor cells, inducing immune 
escape from the tumor. MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, is 
necessary for the survival of T and B lymphocytes and has a high oncogenic 
potential. We aim to evaluate the clinical utility and relevance of MCL-1 and 
PD-L1 in the long-term prognosis of DTC.
METHODS: 120 DTC patients after total thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy 
followed for a minimum of 2 years were included. Demographic features, tumor 
histopathology, persistence/recurrence risk, factors associated with outcome, 
initial response to therapy, persistence or disease-free at the follow-up were 
related to MCL-1 and PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression and BRAFV600E 
mutation.
RESULTS: 100(83.3%) were women, 46.64 ± 16.73 years old at diagnosis; 37(30.8%) 
patients were at high, 45(37.5%) of intermediate and 38(31.7%) of low disease 
recurrence/persistence risk. At the end of follow-up of 124.86 ± 65.36 months, 
48(42.5%) had persistent disease. 103(85.8%) patients had papillary thyroid 
carcinoma (PTC), 17(14.2%) follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). In PTC, 
moderate/strong PD-L1 and MCL-1 expressions were associated to BRAFV600E 
(p=0.0467; p=0.0044). PD-L1 was also associated with tall cell subtype 
(p=0.0274). In FTC, weak PD-L1 expression was associated to the largest nodule 
diameter (p=0.0100). Strong/moderate PD-L1 expression was associated to T2 and 
the weak expression with T3 in TNM classification (p=0.0490). Moderate MCL-1 
expression was associated to smoking (p=0.0350).
CONCLUSIONS: PDL-1, marker of progression of tumor cells and MCL-1, 
anti-apoptotic marker, were associated with PTC carrying BRAFV600E mutation, 
while PDL-1 was associated with more aggressive PTC subtype. MCL-1 and PD-L1 
could be useful in composing a panel to assess the prognosis of PTC patients. On 
the other hand, both markers seemed to have lower relevance to FTC patients.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.mce.2023.111931

dysregulations. These are frequently expressed as increased pro-inflammatory 
states of monocytes and reduced activation capacities in T cells. Hypergravity 
(as artificial gravity) has shown to have beneficial effects on the 
musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system both as a countermeasure option for 
μg-related deconditioning and as ""gravitational therapy"" on Earth. Since the 
impact of hypergravity on immune cells is sparsely explored, we investigated if 
an application of ""mild"" mechanical loading of 2.8 g is able to avoid or treat 
μg-mediated immune dysregulations. For this, T cell and monocyte activation 
states and cytokine pattern were first analyzed after whole blood antigen 
incubation in simulated μg (s-μg) by using the principle of fast clinorotation 
or in hypergravity. Subsequent hypergravity countermeasure approaches were run 
at three different sequences: one preconditioning setting, where 2.8 g was 
applied before s-μg exposure and two therapeutic approaches in which 2.8 g was 
set either intermediately or at the end of s-μg. In single g-grade exposure 
experiments, monocyte pro-inflammatory state was enhanced in s-μg and reduced in 
hypergravity, whereas T cells displayed reduced activation when antigen 
incubation was performed in s-μg. Hypergravity application in all three 
sequences did not alleviate the increased pro-inflammatory potential of 
monocytes. However, in T cells the preconditioning approach restored 
antigen-induced CD69 expression and IFNγ secretion to 1 g control values and 
beyond. This in vitro study demonstrates a proof of concept that mild 
hypergravity is a gravitational preconditioning option to avoid adaptive immune 
cell dysfunctions induced by (s-)μg and that it may act as a booster of immune

(RPLS) cases, postoperative recurrence has complicated and unclear risk factors. 
This study was conducted to explore the correlations between demographic, 
surgical, and pathological characteristics with local recurrence-free survival 
(LRFS) for surgical resected RPLS.
METHODS: RPLS cases that underwent radical operation were considered to be 
included in this analysis. LRFS rates were estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier 
method and were compared between groups by the log-rank test. Cox proportional 
hazard regression models were constructed to identified the predictors of LRFS. 
Subsequently, the independent predictors acquired from multivariate analyses 
were used to construct a nomogram.
RESULTS: 348 RPLS cases who underwent radical operation were included. Of the 
348 cases, 333 had tumor recurrence or with a follow-up period ≥5 years. Thus, 
296 (88.9%) of the 333 cases had recurrent disease, and the median LRFS duration 
of 296 recurrence cases was 17.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 
13.2-20.8) months. Multivariate analysis identified the preoperative 
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), surgical frequency, operative time, tumor 
shape, histological subtype, and tumor necrosis as independent predictors of 
LRFS. Based on above independent predictors, a nomogram was constructed to 
predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year LRFS of surgical resected RPLS.
CONCLUSION: Elevated preoperative NLR, ≥2nd time surgical frequency, extended 
operation time, irregular tumor shape, no well-differentiated histological 
subtype, and tumor necrosis could be used as predictors of LRFS for surgical 
resected RPLS.","© 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Société Internationale de

population. One of the most prevalent is autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). However, 
the therapeutic effects of Buzhong Yiqi (BZYQ) decoction on AIT have not been 
studied yet. The majority of the present study was conducted on NOD.H-2h4 mice 
in an attempt to ascertain the therapeutic effects of BZYQ decoction on AIT.
METHODS: The 0.05% sodium iodide water (NaI)-induced AIT mice model was 
established. A total of nine NOD.H-2h4 mice were randomly divided into three 
groups: the normal group provided with regular water, the model group drinking 
freely 0.05% NaI, and the treatment group treated with BZYQ decoction (9.56 
g/kg) after NaI supplementation (NaI + BZYQ). BZYQ decoction was administered 
orally once daily for eight weeks. The thyroid histopathology test was used to 
measure the severity of lymphocytic infiltration. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) was used to determine the levels of anti-thyroglobulin antibody 
(TgAb), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-17. The Illumina HiSeq X sequencing 
platform was utilized to analyze the thyroid tissue by mRNA expression profiles. 
Bioinformatics analysis was used to investigate the biological function of the 
differentially expressed mRNAs. In addition, the expression of Carbonyl 
Reductase 1 (CBR1), 6-Pyruvoyltetrahydropterin Synthase (PTS), Major 
Histocompatibility Complex, Class II (H2-EB1), Interleukin 23 Subunit Alpha 
(IL-23A), Interleukin 6 Receptor (IL-6RA), and Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) was 
measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
RESULTS: The treatment group exhibited significantly lower rates of thyroiditis 
and lymphocyte infiltration compared to the model group. Serum levels of TgAb, 
IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 were significantly higher in the model group, but they 
fell dramatically after BZYQ decoction administration. According to our results, 
495 genes showed differential expression in the model group compared to the 
control group. Six hundred twenty-five genes were significantly deregulated in 
the treatment group compared to the model group. Bioinformatic analysis showed 
that most mRNAs were associated with immune-inflammatory responses and were 
involved in multiple signaling pathways, including folate biosynthesis and the 
Th17 cell differentiation pathway. CBR1, PTS, H2-EB1, IL23A, IL-6RA and JAK1 
mRNA participated in folate biosynthesis and the Th17 cell differentiation 
pathway. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the above mRNAs were regulated in 
the model group compared to the treatment group Conclusion: The results of this 
investigation have revealed novel insights into the molecular mechanism of

(AECOPD) has profound effects on disease progression and patients' quality of 
life. Emerging evidence suggests an association between alterations in the 
respiratory microbiome flora species and airway inflammation in patients with 
AECOPD. The present study aimed to describe the inflammatory cells and bacterial 
microbiome distributions in respiratory tract in Egyptian patients with AECOPD.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The present cross-sectional study included 208 patients 
with AECOPD. Sputum and broncho-alveolar lavage samples from the studied 
patients were submitted to microbial cultures using appropriate media. Total and 
differential leukocytic counts and were done via automated cell counter.
RESULTS: The present study included 208 AECOPD patients. They comprised 167 
males (80.3%) and 41 females (19.7%) with an age of 57.9 ± 4.9 years. AECOPD was 
categorized as mild, moderate and severe in 30.8%, 43.3% and 26%, respectively. 
Sputum samples had significantly higher TLC, neutrophil percent and eosinophil 
percent when compared with BAL samples. In contrast, lymphocyte percent was 
significantly higher in BAL samples. Sputum specimens had significantly lower 
frequency of positive growths (70.2% versus 86.5%, p = 0.001). Among the 
identified organisms, sputum specimens had significantly lower frequency of 
Strept. pneumoniae (14.4% versus 30.3%, p = 0.001), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.7% 
versus 31.7%, p = 0.024), Haemophilus influenzae (12.5% versus 26.9%, p = 
0.011), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9% versus 10%, p = 0.019) and Acinetobacter 
spp. (1.9% versus 7.2%, p = 0.012) growths when compared with BAL samples.
CONCLUSION: The present study could identify a distinctive pattern of 
inflammatory cell distribution in sputum and BAL samples of AECOPD patients. The 
most commonly isolated organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Strept.

(PCa) evolve into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), while nearly 90% 
of patients with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) exhibit osseous metastases (BM). These 
BM are intimately correlated with the stability of the tumour microenvironment.
PURPOSE: This study aspires to uncover the metabolism-related genes and the 
underlying mechanisms responsible for bone metastatic prostate cancer (BMPCa).
METHODS: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
datasets of PCa and BM were analyzed through R Studio software to identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs underwent functional enrichment 
via Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO), with 
key factors screened by a random forest utilized to establish a prognostic model 
for PCa. The study explored the relationship between DEGs and the stability of 
the immune microenvironment. The action and specificity of CRISP3 in PCa was 
validated through western blot analysis, CCK-8 assay, scratch assay, and 
cellular assay.
RESULTS: The screening of GEO and TCGA datasets resulted in the identification 
of 199 co-differential genes. Three DEGs, including DES, HBB, and SLPI, were 
selected by random forest classification model and cox regression model. 
Immuno-infiltration analysis disclosed that a higher infiltration of naïve B 
cells and resting CD4 memory T cells occurred in the high-expression group of 
DES, whereas infiltration of resting M1 macrophages and NK cells was greater in 
the low-expression group of DES. A significant infiltration of neutrophils was 
observed in the high-expression group of HBB, while greater infiltration of 
gamma delta T cells and M1 macrophages was noted in the low-expression group of 
HBB. Resting dendritic cells, CD8 T cells, and resting T regulatory cells 
(Tregs) infiltrated significantly in the high-expression group of SLPI, while 
only resting mast cells infiltrated significantly in the low-expression group of 
SLPI. CRISP3 was established as a critical gene in BMPCa linked to DES 
expression. Targeting CRISP3, d-glucopyranose may impact tumour prognosis. 
During the mechanistic experiments, it was established that CRISP3 can advance 
the proliferation and metastatic potential of PCa by advancing 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
CONCLUSION: By modulating lipid metabolism and maintaining immunological and 
microenvironmental balance, DES, HBB, and SLPI suppress prostate cancer cell 
growth. The presence of DES-associated CRISP3 is a harbinger of unfavorable 
outcomes in prostate cancer and may escalate tumor proliferation and metastatic 
capabilities by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",©2023 Zhang et al.,"DOI: 10.7717/peerj.15013

both normal and pathological conditions. Traditionally, the main functions of B 
cells were considered to be antibody production and antigen presentation, but in 
recent decades there have been discovered several subpopulations of regulatory B 
lymphocytes (Bregs), which maintain immunological tolerance and prevent 
overactivation of the immune system. Memory (mBregs, CD19+CD24hiCD27+) and 
transitional (tBregs, CD19+CD24hiCD38hi) subpopulations of Bregs are usually 
considered in the context of studying the role of these B cells in various human 
pathologies. However, the mechanisms by which these Breg subpopulations exert 
their immunosuppressive activity remain poorly understood. In this work, we used 
bioinformatic analysis of open-source RNA sequencing data to propose potential 
mechanisms of B cell-mediated immunosuppression. Analysis of differential gene 
expression before and after activation of these subpopulations allowed us to 
identify six candidate molecules that may determine the functionality of mBregs 
and tBregs. IL4I1-, SIRPA-, and SLAMF7-dependent mechanisms of immunosuppression 
may be characteristic of both Breg subsets, while NID1-, CST7-, and 
ADORA2B-dependent mechanisms may be predominantly characteristic of tBregs. 
In-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anti-inflammatory immune 
response of B lymphocytes is an important task for both basic science and 
applied medicine and could facilitate the development of new approaches to the 
therapy of complex diseases.","DOI: 10.1134/S0006297923010029

CD47-signal-regulatory protein (SIRP)α axis as a myeloid immune checkpoint in 
cancer, and this is corroborated by available evidence from the first clinical 
studies with CD47 blockers. However, CD47 is ubiquitously expressed and mediates 
functional interactions with other ligands as well, and therefore targeting of 
the primarily myeloid cell-restricted inhibitory immunoreceptor SIRPα may 
represent a better strategy.
METHOD: We generated BYON4228, a novel SIRPα-directed antibody. An extensive 
preclinical characterization was performed, including direct comparisons to 
previously reported anti-SIRPα antibodies.
RESULTS: BYON4228 is an antibody directed against SIRPα that recognizes both 
allelic variants of SIRPα in the human population, thereby maximizing its 
potential clinical applicability. Notably, BYON4228 does not recognize the 
closely related T-cell expressed SIRPγ that mediates interactions with CD47 as 
well, which are known to be instrumental in T-cell extravasation and activation. 
BYON4228 binds to the N-terminal Ig-like domain of SIRPα and its epitope largely 
overlaps with the CD47-binding site. BYON4228 blocks binding of CD47 to SIRPα 
and inhibits signaling through the CD47-SIRPα axis. Functional studies show that 
BYON4228 potentiates macrophage-mediated and neutrophil-mediated killing of 
hematologic and solid cancer cells in vitro in the presence of a variety of 
tumor-targeting antibodies, including trastuzumab, rituximab, daratumumab and 
cetuximab. The silenced Fc region of BYON4228 precludes immune cell-mediated 
elimination of SIRPα-positive myeloid cells, implying anticipated preservation 
of myeloid immune effector cells in patients. The unique profile of BYON4228 
clearly distinguishes it from previously reported antibodies representative of 
agents in clinical development, which either lack recognition of one of the two 
SIRPα polymorphic variants (HEFLB), or cross-react with SIRPγ and inhibit 
CD47-SIRPγ interactions (SIRPAB-11-K322A, 1H9), and/or have functional Fc 
regions thereby displaying myeloid cell depletion activity (SIRPAB-11-K322A). In 
vivo, BYON4228 increases the antitumor activity of rituximab in a B-cell Raji 
xenograft model in human SIRPαBIT transgenic mice. Finally, BYON4228 shows a 
favorable safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this defines BYON4228 as a preclinically highly 
differentiating pan-allelic SIRPα antibody without T-cell SIRPγ recognition that 
promotes the destruction of antibody-opsonized cancer cells. Clinical studies 
are planned to start in 2023.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

regulation is essential to acquire the effector function of CD8+ T cells. 
However, the role of Utx, a demethylase of histone H3K27, in antitumor immunity 
remains unclear. In this study, we examined the roles of Utx in effector CD8+ 
T-cell differentiation and the antitumor immune response. In a murine 
tumor-bearing model, an increased tumor size and decreased survival rate were 
observed in T-cell-specific Utx KO (Utx KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) 
mice. The number of CD8+ T cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was 
significantly decreased in Utx KO mice. We found that the acquisition of 
effector function was delayed and attenuated in Utx KO CD8+ T cells. RNA 
sequencing revealed that the expression of effector signature genes was 
decreased in Utx KO effector CD8+ T cells, while the expression of naïve or 
memory signature genes was increased. Furthermore, the expression of Cxcr3, 
which is required for the migration of effector CD8+ T cells to tumor sites, was 
substantially decreased in Utx KO CD8+ T cells. These findings suggest that Utx 
promotes CD8+ T-cell-dependent antitumor immune responses partially through 
epigenetic regulation of the effector function.","© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Science published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

prostate cancer, and increased NK cell activity is associated with a better 
prognosis in patients with disease. For patients with advanced stage prostate 
cancer, immunotherapies are a promising approach when standard treatment options 
have been exhausted. With the rapid emergence of NK cell-based therapies, it is 
important to understand the mechanisms by which NK cells can be triggered to 
kill cancer cells that have developed immune-evasive strategies. Altering the 
cytokine profiles of advanced prostate cancer cells may be an area to explore 
when considering ways in which NK cell activation can be modulated. We have 
previously demonstrated that combining the cytokine, IL-27, with TLR3 agonist, 
poly(I:C), changes cytokine secretion in the advanced prostate cancer models, 
PC3 and DU145 cells. Herein, we extend our previous work to study the effect of 
primary human NK cells on prostate cancer cell death in an in vitro co-culture 
model. Stimulating PC3 and DU145 cells with IL-27 and poly(I:C) induced IFN-β 
secretion, which was required for activation of primary human NK cells to kill 
these stimulated prostate cancer cells. PC3 cells were more sensitized to NK 
cell-mediated killing when compared to DU145 cells, which was attributed to 
differential levels of IFN-β produced in response to stimulation with IL-27 and 
poly(I:C). IFN-β increased granzyme B secretion and membrane-bound TRAIL 
expression by co-cultured NK cells. We further demonstrated that these NK cells 
killed PC3 cells in a partially TRAIL-dependent manner. This work provides 
mechanistic insight into how the cytotoxic function of NK cells can be improved 
to target cancer cells.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2023.104718

in T cell development. THEMIS, via its distinctive CABIT domains, inhibits the 
catalytic activity of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (PTPN6). SHP1 and THEMIS 
bind to the ubiquitous cytosolic adapter GRB2, and the purported formation of a 
tri-molecular THEMIS-GRB2-SHP1 complex facilitates inactivation of SHP1 by 
THEMIS. The importance of this function of GRB2 among its numerous documented 
activities is unclear as GRB2 binds to multiple proteins and participates in 
several signaling responses in thymocytes. Here, we show that similar to 
Themis-/- thymocytes, the primary molecular defect in GRB2-deficient thymocytes 
is increased catalytically active SHP1 and the developmental block in 
GRB2-deficient thymocytes is alleviated by deletion or inhibition of SHP1 and is 
exacerbated by SHP1 overexpression. Thus, the principal role of GRB2 during T 
cell development is to promote THEMIS-mediated inactivation of SHP1 thereby 
enhancing the sensitivity of TCR signaling in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes to low 
affinity positively selecting self-ligands.","This is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection

low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma (LGASC) of the breast continues to pose 
diagnostic challenges. Unlike other triple-negative breast carcinomas, LGASC 
tends to have an indolent clinical behaviour. It is essential to recognise this 
lesion for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five cases of LGASC were identified in our archives 
and collaborating institutes. Cases of LGASC with dominant coexisting other type 
carcinomas were excluded. We studied the clinical presentation, morphological 
features, patterns of the commonly used immunohistochemical stains and 
follow-up. In our cohort, LGASC was commonly located at the outer aspect of the 
breast and associated with intraductal papilloma. The morphology of LGASC is 
characterised by infiltrating small glands and nests with variable squamous 
differentiation. We also found cuffing desmoplastic (fibrolamellar) stromal 
change in 75% of patients and peripheral lymphocytic aggregates in 87.5% of 
patients. P63 and smooth muscle myosin (SMM) were the most common myoepithelial 
markers used to assist in diagnosis. P63 often stained peripheral tumour cells 
surrounding invasive glands (circumferential staining in 80% of the cases), 
mimicking myoepithelial cells. It also stained the small nests with squamous 
differentiation. However, SMM was negative in 63% of the cases. The vast 
majority of our cases were triple-negative; only a few had focal and weak 
expressions of ER and PR. One patient who did not have excision developed lymph 
node metastasis. Most patients underwent excision or mastectomy with negative 
margins as surgical treatment; there were no recurrences or metastases in these 
patients with clinical follow-ups up to 108 months.
CONCLUSIONS: LGASC has some unique, although not entirely specific, 
morphological features and immunohistochemical staining patterns. Fibrolamellar 
stromal change, peripheral lymphocytic aggregates and variable staining of p63 
and SMM are valuable features to facilitate the diagnosis.",© 2023 The Authors. Histopathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/his.14917

presence of Addison's disease (AD) along with autoimmune thyroid disease and/or 
type 1 diabetes. APS type 2 is known as Schmidt's syndrome when autoimmune 
adrenal insufficiency is associated with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. We 
report a very rare case of a 28-year-old female patient who had Schmidt's 
syndrome revealed by a thyroid storm (TS) concomitant with an acute adrenal 
crisis. The onset of AD resulted in a surgical emergency. The patient presented 
with cardiogenic shock and an acute abdomen. The precipitation factor was 
Hashitoxicosis presented as TS. This life-threatening condition was successfully 
reversed with aggressive medical therapy based on antithyroid drugs and 
intravenous glucocorticoids. This hyperthyroid phase lasted for a period of 8 
months. The patient eventually developed hypothyroidism, suggesting that 
Hashimoto's thyroiditis was the most likely diagnosis. She was started on 
levothyroxine replacement therapy and remained euthyroid on levothyroxine. The 
case we describe had several diagnostic pitfalls that are discussed both at the 
start as well as during the evolution.
LEARNING POINTS: Autoimmune diseases can appear concomitantly or succeed each 
other over time. The clinician must be vigilant to detect these diseases in time 
in order to avoid a misdiagnosis of a life-threatening emergency such as adrenal 
insufficiency or thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is an uncommon but 
life-threatening manifestation of hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is dependent on 
clinical symptoms, and no specific laboratory tests are available. 
Glucocorticoids should be used in the treatment of thyroid storm because they 
have an inhibitory effect on peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. In patients who 
have severe thyrotoxicosis, especially in conjunction with hypotension, 
treatment with glucocorticoids has become standard practice because of the 
possibility of relative adrenal insufficiency or the possibility of undiagnosed 
Addison's disease. The differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism can be 
challenging. Graves' disease can be discussed in view of the severity of the 
clinical presentation and the prolonged duration of the hyperthyroid phase. 
Hashitoxicosis is the initial hyperthyroid phase in chronic autoimmune 
thyroiditis. The hyperthyroid phase is always followed by definitive resolution, 
with persistent euthyroidism and no hyperthyroid relapses. Synthetic antithyroid 
drugs may be prescribed during the hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto thyroiditis 
if the clinical presentation is severe and the duration of the hyperthyroid 
phase is prolonged.","DOI: 10.1530/EDM-21-0152

Group III, one of the most common subgroups of PH; however, it lacks effective 
treatment options. Cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (DON) has been shown to 
effectively improve Group I PH. However, its effects on Group III PH are 
unknown. Methods: A lung fibrosis-induced PH mouse model was constructed using a 
single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BLM), after which DON was 
administered daily. Pulmonary artery and right ventricle (RV) remodeling were 
evaluated at the end of the study. Lung tissue in each group was analyzed using 
RNA sequencing, and the results were further verified with datasets from 
patients with PH. The mechanisms underlying DON-induced effects on PH were 
verified both in vivo and in vitro. Results: DON effectively improved pulmonary 
artery and RV remodeling in the BLM-induced mouse model. Transcriptomic profiles 
of lung tissue indicated that the expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes 
was significantly changed in this process. In the animal model and patients with 
PH, T helper 17 lymphocytes (Th17) were the most common inflammatory cells 
infiltrating the lung tissue. DON significantly inhibited lung fibroblast 
activation; thus, preventing lung fibrosis and reducing the inflammatory 
response and Th17 cell infiltration in the BLM-induced lung tissue. In addition, 
Th17 cells could activate lung fibroblasts by secreting IL17A, and DON-mediated 
inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation was found to depend on the 
α7nAchR-JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Conclusion: DON can alleviate lung fibrosis and PH 
in an experimental mouse model. It inhibited pro-inflammatory Th17 cell 
differentiation, which is dependent on a cholinergic receptor pathway, thereby 
regulating fibroblast activation.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/thno.82069

peripheral tolerance. Treg-based immunotherapy is valuable for the clinical 
management of diseases resulting from dysregulation of immune tolerance. 
However, the lack of potency is a potential limitation of Treg therapy. In 
addition, CD69 positive-Treg (CD69+ Treg) represent a newly identified subset of 
Tregs with potent immune suppressive capability. Methods: Foxp3 YFP-Cre CD69 
fl/fl and CD4 Cre CD69 fl/fl mice were generated to determine the relevance of 
CD69 to Treg. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP) and luciferase Assay 
were performed to detect the regulation of CD69 transcription by heat shock 
transcription factor 1(HSF1). Gene expression was measured by western blotting 
and qRT-PCR. The differentiation of naive T cells to CD69+Foxp3+ iTregs was 
determined by flow cytometry. The immunosuppressive ability of Tregs was 
analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Colon inflammation in mice was reflected 
by changes in body weight and colon length, the disease activity index (DAI), 
and H&E staining of colon tissues. Results: Induced Tregs (iTregs) from CD4 Cre 
CD69 fl/fl mice failed to alleviate colitis. The transcription factor HSF1 
interacted with the promoter of the CD69 gene to prompt its transcription during 
Treg differentiation. Genetic and chemical inhibition of HSF1 impaired CD69+ 
Treg differentiation and promoted the pathogenesis of colitis in mice. In 
contrast, HSF1 protein stabilized by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation 
promoted CD69+ Treg differentiation and alleviated colitis in mice. Moreover, 
adoptive transfer of iTregs with HSF1 stabilization by proteasome inhibitor 
(PSI) dramatically prevented the development of colitis in mice and was 
accompanied by decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced 
accumulation of pro-inflammatory lymphocytes in colitis tissue, whereas Tregs 
induced in the absence of PSI were less stable and ineffective in suppressing 
colitis. Conclusions: HSF1 promotes CD69+ Tregs differentiation by activating 
the CD69 transcription, which is critical for the immunosuppressive function of 
Tregs. Stabilization of HSF1 by PSIs results in the efficient generation of 
Tregs with high potency to treat colitis and probably other autoimmune diseases 
involving Tregs deficiency.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/thno.78078

molecule expressed on antigen-presenting cells that provides the costimulatory 
signals required for T cell activation and survival. CD86 binds to two ligands 
on the surface of T cells: the antigen CD28 and cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). By binding to CD28, CD86-together with 
CD80-promotes the participation of T cells in the antigen presentation process. 
However, the interrelationships among CD86, immunotherapy, and immune 
infiltration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unclear.
METHODS: The immunological effects of CD86 in various cancers (including on 
chemokines, immunostimulators, MHC, and receptors) were evaluated through a 
pan-cancer analysis using TCGA and GEO databases. The relationship between CD86 
expression and mononucleotide variation, gene copy number variation, 
methylation, immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs), and T-cell inflammation score in 
AML was subsequently examined. ESTIMATE and limma packages were used to identify 
genes at the intersection of CD86 with StromalScore and ImmuneScore. 
Subsequently, GO/KEGG and PPI network analyses were performed. The immune risk 
score (IRS) model was constructed, and the validation set was used for 
verification. The predictive value was compared with the TIDE score.
RESULTS: CD86 was overexpressed in many cancers, and its overexpression was 
associated with a poor prognosis. CD86 expression was positively correlated with 
the expression of CTLA4, PDCD1LG2, IDO1, HAVCR2, and other genes and negatively 
correlated with CD86 methylation. The expression of CD86 in AML cell lines was 
detected by QRT-PCR and Western blot, and the results showed that CD86 was 
overexpressed in AML cell lines. Immune infiltration assays showed that CD86 
expression was positively correlated with CD8 T cell, Dendritic cell, 
macrophage, NK cell, and Th1_cell and also with immune examination site, immune 
regulation, immunotherapy response, and TIICs. ssGSEA showed that CD86 was 
enriched in immune-related pathways, and CD86 expression was correlated with 
mutations in the genes RB1, ERBB2, and FANCC, which are associated with 
responses to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The IRS score performed better than 
the TIDE website score.
CONCLUSION: CD86 appears to participate in immune invasion in AML and is an 
important player in the tumor microenvironment in this malignancy. At the same 
time, the IRS score developed by us has a good effect and may provide some 
support for the diagnosis of AML. Thus, CD86 may serve as a potential target for 
AML immunotherapy.",Copyright © 2023 Qianqian Zhang et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/9988405

syndrome mediated by immune cells. The mechanism of this immune disorder is not 
well understood and therapeutic strategies still need to be improved.
METHODS: Studies have found that abnormalities in metabolisms promote the 
survival of AA cells. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have 
reported the immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of AA. In this study, 
we analyzed the transcriptome of AA from peripheral blood compared with healthy 
donors by single-cell sequencing and identified the affected metabolic pathways 
including lysine degradation. We demonstrated that the metabolic abnormalities 
of T lymphocytes mainly focus on glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. In addition, the 
metabolic abnormalities of natural killer cells concentrated in oxidative 
phosphorylation.
RESULTS: The key genes involved in abnormal metabolic processes were Neustein 
neurotrophic factor (NENF), inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II B 
(INPP4B), aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C3 (AKR1C3), and carbohydrate 
(N-acetylglucosamine-6-O) sulfotransferase 2 (CHST2) by differential gene 
expression analysis.
DISCUSSION: Molecule interaction analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor 
superfamily, member 12 (TNFSM12) in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling was 
broadly activated in AA. In conclusion, we suppose that the treatment of the 
immune cells' abnormal metabolic pathway may contribute to the development of 
novel strategies to treat AA.","Copyright © 2023 Zhou, Huang, Liu, Huang, Wen, Yang, Liang, Chen and Chen.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1075408

Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional 
Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.","BACKGROUND: The close relationship between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has been supported by many aspects, including 
but not limited to clinical manifestations, epidemiology and pathogenesis. Some 
evidence suggests that immune cells actively participated in the pathogenesis of 
both diseases. However, information on which cells are primarily involved in 
this process and how these cells mobilize, migrate and interact is still 
limited.
METHODS: Datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. 
Common differentially expressed genes (coDEGs) were identified by package 
""limma"". The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Weighted Gene 
Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) were used to analyze the interactions 
between coDEGs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and inverse cumulative 
distribution function were applied to identify common differential pathways, 
while Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to confirm the significance. 
Correlation analysis between coDEGs and immune cells led to the identification 
of critical immune-cell-related coDEGs. The diagnostic models were established 
based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, 
while receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to identify the 
ability of the model. Validation datasets were imported to demonstrate the 
significant association of coDEGs with specific immune cells and the 
capabilities of the diagnostic model.
RESULTS: In total, 67 genes were up-regulated and 185 genes were down-regulated 
in both diseases. Four down-regulated pathways and four up-regulated pathways 
were considered important. Up-regulated coDEGs were firmly associated with 
neutrophils, while down-regulated genes were significantly associated with CD8+ 
T-cells and CD4+ T-cells in both AS and IBD datasets. Five up-regulated and six 
down-regulated key immue-cell-related coDEGs were identified. Diagnostic models 
based on key immue-cell-related coDEGs were established and tested. Validation 
datasets confirmed the significance of the correlation between coDEGs and 
specific immune cells.
CONCLUSION: This study provides fresh insights into the co-pathogenesis of AS 
and IBD. It is proposed that neutrophils and T cells may be actively involved in 
this process, however, in opposite ways. The immue-cell-related coDEGs, revealed 
in this study, may be relevant to their regulation, although relevant research 
is still lacking.","Copyright © 2023 Ding, Yang and Xue.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1137523

myopathy characterised by skeletal muscle infiltration and myofibre invasion by 
CD8+ T lymphocytes. In some cases, IBM has been reported to be associated with a 
systemic lymphoproliferative disorder of CD8+ T cells exhibiting a highly 
differentiated effector phenotype known as T cell Large Granular Lymphocytic 
Leukemia (T-LGLL).
METHODS: We investigated the incidence of a CD8+ T-LGL lymphoproliferative 
disorder in 85 IBM patients and an aged-matched group of 56 Healthy Controls 
(HC). Further, we analysed the phenotypical characteristics of the expanded 
T-LGLs and investigated whether their occurrence was associated with any 
particular HLA alleles or clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Blood cell analysis by flow cytometry revealed expansion of T-LGLs in 
34 of the 85 (40%) IBM patients. The T cell immunophenotype of T-LGLHIGH 
patients was characterised by increased expression of surface molecules 
including CD57 and KLRG1, and to a lesser extent of CD94 and CD56 predominantly 
in CD8+ T cells, although we also observed modest changes in CD4+ T cells and γδ 
T cells. Analysis of Ki67 in CD57+ KLRG1+ T cells revealed that only a small 
proportion of these cells was proliferating. Comparative analysis of CD8+ and 
CD4+ T cells isolated from matched blood and muscle samples donated by three 
patients indicated a consistent pattern of more pronounced alterations in 
muscles, although not significant due to small sample size. In the T-LGLHIGH 
patient group, we found increased frequencies of perforin-producing CD8+ and 
CD4+ T cells that were moderately correlated to combined CD57 and KLRG1 
expression. Investigation of the HLA haplotypes of 75 IBM patients identified 
that carriage of the HLA-C*14:02:01 allele was significantly higher in T-LGLHIGH 
compared to T-LGLLOW individuals. Expansion of T-LGL was not significantly 
associated with seropositivity patient status for anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 
1A autoantibodies. Clinically, the age at disease onset and disease duration 
were similar in the T-LGLHIGH and T-LGLLOW patient groups. However, metadata 
analysis of functional alterations indicated that patients with expanded T-LGL 
more frequently relied on mobility aids than T-LGLLOW patients indicating 
greater disease severity.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, these results suggest that T-LGL expansion occurring in 
IBM patients is correlated with exacerbated immune dysregulation and increased 
disease burden.","Copyright © 2023 McLeish, Sooda, Slater, Kachigunda, Beer, Paramalingam, Lamont,

University, Jiangmen, China.","OBJECTIVES: The Notch signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis 
of active tuberculosis (TB), and Th1-type cell-mediated immunity is essential 
for effective control of mycobacterial infection. However, it remains unclear 
whether Notch signaling molecules (Notch1, DLL1, and Hes1) and Th1-type factors 
(T-bet and IFN-γ) can serve as biomarkers for tracking the progression of active 
TB at different stages along with peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) 
parameters.
METHODS: A total of 60 participants were enrolled in the study, including 37 
confirmed TB patients (mild (n=17), moderate/severe (n=20)) and 23 healthy 
controls. The mRNA expression of Notch1, DLL1, Hes1, T-bet and IFN-γ in the 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the subjects was measured by 
RT-qPCR, then analyzed for differences. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve 
(ROC) was used to assess the effectiveness of each factor as a biomarker in 
identifying lung injury.
RESULTS: We found that mRNA expression levels of Notch1, DLL1, and Hes1 were 
upregulated in active TB patients, with higher levels observed in those with 
moderate/severe TB than those with mild TB or without TB. In contrast, mRNA 
levels of T-bet and IFN-γ were downregulated and significantly lower in mild and 
moderate/severe cases. Furthermore, the combiROC analysis of IFN-γ and the 
percentage of lymphocytes (L%) among WBC parameters showed superior 
discriminatory ability compared to other factors for identifying individuals 
with active TB versus healthy individuals. Notably, Notch pathway molecules were 
more effective than Th1-type factors and WBC parameters in differentiating mild 
and moderate/severe cases of active TB, particularly in the combiROC model that 
included Notch1 and Hes1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that Notch1, Hes1, IFN-γ, and L% can be used 
as biomarkers to identify different stages of active TB patients and to monitor 
the effectiveness of treatment.","Copyright © 2023 Xie, Chen, Chen, Long, Zhang and Liu.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1134123

diseases that, until recently, were considered separate entities. These entities 
have a similar clinical presentation, serological findings, and pathogenesis, so 
they are currently considered a single multisystemic disease. The common 
characteristic is the infiltration of involved tissues by plasma cells and 
lymphocytes that are positive for IgG4. Three major criteria have been proposed 
for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD: clinical, laboratory, and histological. The 
pancreas is the organ that is most affected by IgG4-RD, which can simulate a 
tumor. In this respect, a series of signs could help us suspect that the 
pancreatic findings do not reflect a tumor (halo sign, duct-penetrating sign, 
absence of vascular invasion, etc.). The differential diagnosis is important to 
avoid unnecessary surgical interventions.","Copyright © 2022 SERAM. Published by Elsevier España, S.L.U. All rights

with the occurrence and development of breast cancer, which may attribute to 
altered immunotoxicity and immune regulation. Currently, cancer immunotherapy 
aims to promote tumor-specific T cell responses, especially CD4+T helper cells 
(Th) for anti-tumor immunity. The histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are 
found to exert an anti-tumor effect by reshaping the tumor immune 
microenvironment, but the immune regulatory mechanism of HDACis in PAHs-induced 
breast tumor remains elusive. Here, using established breast cancer models 
induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), a potent carcinogenic agent of 
PAH, the novel HDACi, 2-hexyl-4-pentylene acid (HPTA) exhibited anti-tumor 
effect by activating T lymphocytes immune function. HPTA recruited CXCR3+CD4+T 
cells into chemokines CXCL9/10-enriched tumor sites, and the increased secretion 
of CXCL9/10 was regulated by the NF-κB-mediated pathway. Furthermore, HPTA 
promoted Th1 differentiation and assisted cytotoxic CD8+T cells in the 
elimination of breast cancer cells. These findings support the proposition of 
HPTA as a potential therapeutic in the treatment of PAHs-induced

performance and clinical utility of D-dimer and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR) in the early differential diagnosis of acute aortic syndrome (AAS).
METHODS: The consecutive patients presenting to Tianjin Chest Hospital for 
suspected AAS were retrospectively investigated between June 2018 and December 
2021. The baseline values of D-dimer and NLR were analyzed and compared in the 
study population. The discriminative ability of D-dimer and NLR was illustrated 
and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI). Clinical utility was evaluated by means of 
decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: In the study period, a total of 697 participants suspected of having 
AAS were enrolled and 323 had a final diagnosis of AAS. The baseline level of 
NLR as well as D-dimer was higher in patients with AAS. The use of NLR showed 
excellent overall diagnostic performance for AAS with a comparable AUC to that 
of D-dimer (0.845 vs. 0.822, P > 0.05). The reclassification analyses further 
confirmed that NLR had better discriminative properties for AAS with a 
significant NRI of 66.1% and IDI of 12.4% (P < 0.001). Moreover, NLR provided 
higher net benefit than D-dimer as shown by DCA. Similar results were observed 
in subgroup analyses according to the different classes of AAS.
CONCLUSIONS: NLR outperformed D-dimer with improved discriminative performance 
and superior clinical utility in identifying AAS. As a more readily available 
biomarker, NLR may be a reliable alternative to D-dimer for the screening of 
suspected AAS in clinical practice.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ajem.2023.03.059

disease, and there are few medicines at present. An increasing number of studies 
indicate that Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis) and its excretory-secretory 
(ES) antigens are inflammatory modulator. Therefore, this study focused on the 
effects of T. spiralis ES antigens on allergic asthma. Asthma model was 
established by sensitizing mice with ovalbumin antigen (OVA) and aluminum 
hydroxide (Al[OH]3), the asthmatic mice were interfered using T. spiralis 43 kDa 
protein (Ts43), T. spiralis 49 kDa protein (Ts49), and T. spiralis 53 kDa 
protein (Ts53), the important components of ES antigens, to establish ES 
antigens intervention models. Then, asthma symptom changes, weight changes, and 
lung inflammation of mice were evaluated. The results showed that ES antigens 
could relieve symptoms, weight loss, and lung inflammation caused by asthma in 
the mice, and the effect of combined intervention of Ts43, Ts49, and Ts53 was 
better. Finally, the effects of ES antigens on type 1 helper T (Th1) and type 2 
helper T (Th2) immune responses, and the differentiation direction of T 
lymphocytes in mice were discussed by detecting Th1 and Th2 cell-related factors 
and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells. The results suggested that the ratio of 
CD4+/CD8+ T cells decreased and the ratio of Th1/Th2 cells increased. In 
conclusion, this study indicated that T. spiralis ES antigens could mitigate 
allergic asthma in the mice by changing the differentiation direction of CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells and regulating the imbalance of Th1/Th2 cells ratio.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.110101

growth and metastatic seeding in patients with breast cancer. Deregulation of 
plasticity between Treg and Th17 cells creates an immune regulatory framework 
that enables tumor progression. Here, we discovered a functional role for 
Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in promoting Treg differentiation and immunosuppressive 
activity, and when Hh activity was inhibited, Tregs adopted a Th17-like 
phenotype complemented by an enhanced inflammatory profile. Mechanistically, Hh 
signaling promoted O-GlcNAc modifications of critical Treg and Th17 
transcription factors, Foxp3 and STAT3, respectively, that orchestrated this 
transition. Blocking Hh reprogramed Tregs metabolically, dampened their 
immunosuppressive activity, and supported their transdifferentiation into 
inflammatory Th17 cells that enhanced the recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells 
into tumors. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown role for Hh signaling

the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. 
Because of the high rates of relapse, there is an immediate and pressing need 
for the discovery of innovative sensitive biomarkers for OC patients. Using TCGA 
and GSE26712 datasets, we were able to identify 17 survival-related DEGs in OC 
that had differential expression. CLDN4 was the gene that caught our attention 
the most out of the 17 important genes since its expression was much higher in 
OC samples than in nontumor samples. The findings of the ROC assays then 
confirmed the diagnostic utility of the test in screening OC specimens to 
differentiate them from nontumor specimens. Patients with high CLDN4 expression 
predicted a shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) 
than those with low CLDN4 expression, according to clinical research. Patients 
with low CLDN4 expression predicted longer OS and DSS. Analysis using both 
univariate and multivariate techniques revealed that CLDN4 expression was an 
independent factor associated with a poor prognosis for OS and DSS. Based on 
multivariate analysis, the C-indexes and calibration plots of the nomogram 
suggested an effective predictive performance for OC patients. After that, we 
investigated whether or not there was a link between the infiltration of immune 
cells and the expression of the CLDN4 gene. We found that the expression of 
CLDN4 was positively associated with Th17 cells, NK CD56bright cells, while 
negatively associated with Th2 cells, pDC, and T helper cells. In the end, we 
carried out RT-PCR on our cohort and confirmed that the level of CLDN4 
expression was noticeably elevated in OC specimens in comparison to nontumor 
tissues. The diagnostic usefulness of CLDN4 expression for OC was also validated 
by the findings of ROC tests. Thus, our findings revealed that CLDN4 may serve 
as a predictive biomarker in OC to assess both the clinical outcome of OC 
patients and the level of immune infiltration.",Copyright © 2023 Pan Hu et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/1075265

tests of olfactory function. DNA methylation and GABAergic input have been 
implicated in biochemical processes controlling odor in animal studies, but this 
has not been investigated in human studies.
METHODS: In a study of measures of DNA methylation and GABAergic mRNAs in 
lymphocytes, we also measured odor identification and discrimination with the 
Sniffin' Sticks battery in 58 patients with chronic schizophrenia (CSZ) and 48 
controls. mRNAs in lymphocytes were assessed by qPCR using TaqManTM probes. 
Cognition was assessed by the MATRICS battery (Measurement and Treatment 
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia) in CSZ and controls, and 
symptoms in CSZ were assessed by PANSS scale (Positive and Negative Symptom 
Scale). The relationships of odor deficits with mRNA, cognition, and symptoms 
were explored by correlation analysis. Variables which significantly 
differentiated CSZ from controls were explored by logistic regression.
RESULTS: Overall, CSZ showed significantly (P≤.001) lower scores on odor 
discrimination compared to controls, with a moderate effect size, but no 
difference in odor identification. Deficits in odor discrimination, which has 
not been standardly assessed in many prior studies, strongly differentiated CSZ 
from controls. In logistic regression analysis, odor discrimination, but not 
odor identification, was a significant variable predicting schizophrenia versus 
control class membership. This is the first study to report relationship between 
odor deficits and DNA methylation and GABAergic mRNAs in blood cells of human 
subjects. There were negative correlations of odor identification with DNA 
methylation enzymes mRNAs and significant negative correlations with odor 
discrimination and GABAergic mRNAs. Lower odor scores were significantly 
associated with lower cognitive scores on the MATRICS battery in CSZ but not 
control subjects. In CSZ, lower odor scores were significantly associated with 
negative symptom scores, while higher odor identification scores were associated 
with PANNS Excitement factor.
DISCUSSION: Odor discrimination was a more powerful variable than odor 
identification in discriminating CSZ from controls and should be used more 
regularly as an odor measure in studies of schizophrenia. The substantive 
meaning of the negative correlations of odor discrimination and GABAergic mRNA 
variables in peripheral lymphocytes of CSZ needs more investigation and 
comparison with results in neural tissue.","Copyright © 2023 Smith, Sershen, Youssef, Lajtha, Jin, Zhang, Chen, Guidotti and

adaptive immune receptor (AIR) sequencing (scVDJ-seq) has been invaluable in 
studying lymphocyte biology. Here we introduce Dandelion, a computational 
pipeline for scVDJ-seq analysis. It enables the application of standard V(D)J 
analysis workflows to single-cell datasets, delivering improved V(D)J contig 
annotation and the identification of nonproductive and partially spliced 
contigs. We devised a strategy to create an AIR feature space that can be used 
for both differential V(D)J usage analysis and pseudotime trajectory inference. 
The application of Dandelion improved the alignment of human thymic development 
trajectories of double-positive T cells to mature single-positive CD4/CD8 T 
cells, generating predictions of factors regulating lineage commitment. 
Dandelion analysis of other cell compartments provided insights into the origins

deaths worldwide with limited available medicines. While drug repurposing comes 
as a promising strategy for cancer treatment, we discovered that propranolol 
(Prop), a non-selective β1 and β2 adrenergic receptor blocker, significantly 
inhibited the development of subcutaneous CT26 CRC and AOM/DSS-induced CRC 
models. The RNA-seq analysis highlighted the activated immune pathways after 
Prop treatment, with KEGG analysis enriched in T-cell differentiation. Routine 
analyses of blood revealed a decrease in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, a 
biomarker of systemic inflammation, and a prognostic indicator in the 
Prop-treated groups in both CRC models. Analysis of the tumor-infiltrating 
immune cells exhibited that Prop regressed the exhaustion of CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells in the CT26-derived graft models, which was further corroborated in the 
AOM/DSS-induced models. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis fitted well with the 
experimental data, showing that β2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) was positively 
correlated with T-cell exhaustion signature in various tumors. The in vitro 
experiment showed no direct effect of Prop on CT26 cell viability, while T cells 
were activated with significantly-upregulated production of IFN-γ and Granzyme 
B. Consistently, Prop was unable to restrain CT26 tumor growth in nude mice. At 
last, the combination of Prop and the chemotherapeutic drug Irinotecan acted out 
the strongest inhibition in CT26 tumor progress. Collectively, we repurpose Prop 
as a promising and economical therapeutic drug for CRC treatment and highlight

aimed to investigate the role of SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 
(SMURF1) in the Th17 and Th17.1 differentiation and Treg/Th17 imbalance, which 
are major factors contributing to the pathogenesis of SLE. SLE patients and 
healthy individuals were recruited to detect the SMURF1 levels in naïve CD4+ 
cells from peripheral blood. Purified and expanded naïve CD4+ T cells were 
employed to evaluate the effects of SMURF1 on Th17 and Th17.1 polarization in 
vitro. MRL/lpr lupus model was employed to explore the disease phenotype as well 
as Treg/Th17 balance in vivo. The results showed that SMURF1 was down-regulated 
in naïve CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood of patients with SLE and in spleen of 
MRL/lpr mice. SMURF1 overexpression suppressed the polarization of naïve CD4+ T 
cells toward Th17 and Th17.1 phenotype and down-regulated the expression of 
retinoid-related orphan receptor-gammat (RORγt). Subsequently, SMURF1 
down-regulation aggravated the disease phenotype, inflammation, and the 
Treg/Th17 imbalance in MRL/lpr mice. Furthermore, we found that SMURF 
overexpression promoted the ubiquitination and decreases the stability of RORγt. 
In conclusion, SMURF1 inhibited the polarization of Th17 and Th17.1 cells and 
improved the Treg/Th17 imbalance in SLE, which was mediated as least partly by

including electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). These flavors are a mixture of 
chemicals with overlapping constituents. There are no comparative toxicity 
studies of these flavors produced by different manufacturers. We hypothesized 
that acute exposure to menthol and tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosols induces 
inflammatory, genotoxicity, and metabolic responses in mouse lungs. We compared 
two brands, A and B, e-cig flavors (PG/VG, menthol, and tobacco) with and 
without nicotine for their inflammatory response, genotoxic markers, altered 
genes and proteins in the context of metabolism by exposing mouse strains, 
C57BL/6J (Th1-mediated) and BALB/cJ (Th2-mediated). Brand A nicotine-free 
menthol exposure caused increased neutrophils and differential T-lymphocyte 
influx in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and induced significant 
immunosuppression, while brand A tobacco with nicotine elicited an allergic 
inflammatory response with increased Eotaxin, IL-6, and RANTES levels. Brand B 
elicited a similar inflammatory response in menthol flavor exposure. Upon e-cig 
exposure, genotoxicity markers, significantly increased in lung tissue. These 
inflammatory and genotoxicity responses were associated with altered NLRP3 
inflammasome and TRPA1 induction by menthol flavor. Nicotine decreased 
surfactant protein D and increased PAI-1 by menthol and tobacco flavors, 
respectively. Integration of inflammatory and metabolic pathway gene expression 
analysis showed immunometabolic regulation in T-cells via PI3K/Akt/p70S6k-mTOR 
axis associated with suppressed immunity/allergic immune response. Overall, this 
study showed comparative toxicity of flavored e-cig aerosols, unraveling 
potential signaling pathways of nicotine and flavor-mediated pulmonary 
toxicological responses, and emphasized the need for standardized toxicity 
testing for appropriate premarket authorization of e-cigarette products.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

peptides in humans and is an autoantigen in several autoimmune diseases and in 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In this report, we profiled the specific T cell 
response to the autoimmune self-antigen LL-37 and investigated the factors 
modulating the response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy 
subjects and ACS patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The activation induced marker (AIM) assay demonstrated 
differential T cell profiles characterized by the persistence of CD134 and 
CD137, markers that impair tolerance and promote immune effector and memory 
response, in ACS compared to Controls. Specifically, CD8+CD69+CD137+ T cells 
were significantly increased by LL-37 stimulation in ACS PBMCs. T effector cell 
response to LL-37 were either HLA dependent or independent as determined by 
blocking with monoclonal antibody to either Class-I HLA or Class-II HLA. 
Blocking of immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 demonstrated the control of 
self-reactive T cell response to LL-37 was modulated predominantly by CTLA-4. 
Platelets from healthy controls down-modulated CD8+CD69+CD137+ T cell response 
to LL-37 in autologous PBMCs. CD8+CD69+CD137+ T cell AIM profile negatively 
correlated with platelet count in ACS patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report demonstrates that the immune response to the autoantigen 
LL-37 in ACS patients is characterized specifically by CD8+CD69+CD137+ T cell 
AIM profile with persistent T cell activation and the generation of immunologic 
memory. The results provide potentially novel insight into mechanistic pathways 
of antigen-specific immune signaling in ACS.","Copyright © 2023 Chernomordik, Cercek, Zhou, Zhao, Lio, Chyu, Shah and Dimayuga.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1113904

however, the responses to ICI treatment are highly variable in different 
individuals and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we 
employed a mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) model where tumor-bearing 
recipients diverged into responders (R) versus non-responders (NR) upon 
anti-PD-L1 treatment. We performed in-depth TCRβ sequencing with immunoSEQ 
platform to delineate the differences in CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs). We found that R and NR CD8 TILs both exhibited evidence of clonal 
expansion, suggesting activation regardless of response status. We detected no 
differences in clonal expansion or clonal diversity indexes between R vs. NR. 
However, the top expanded (>1%) TCRβ clonotypes appeared to be mutually 
exclusive between R and NR CD8 TILs, showing a preferential expansion of 
distinct TCRβ clonotypes in response to the same SCC tumor in R vs. NR. Notably, 
the mutual exclusivity of TCR clonotypes in R vs. NR was only observed when top 
TCRβ clonotypes were counted, because such top-expanded clonotypes are present 
in the opposite outcome group at a much lower frequency. Many TCRβ sequences 
were detected in only one recipient at a high frequency, implicating highly 
individualized anti-tumor immune responses. We conclude that differences in the 
clonal frequency of top TCR clonotypes between R and NR CD8 TILs may be one of 
the factors underlying differential anti-PD-L1 responses. This notion may offer 
a novel explanation for variable ICI responses in different individuals, which 
may substantially impact the development of new strategies for personalized 
cancer immunotherapy.","Copyright © 2023 John, Chen, Woolaver, Ge, Vashisht, Huang, Chen and Wang.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1100520

vaccine-associated brucellosis; and these safety concerns have affected their 
application. Although subunit vaccines have the advantages of safety, efficacy, 
low cost, and rapid production, they are usually poorly immunogenic and 
insufficient to trigger persistent immunity. Therefore, we added layered double 
hydroxide (LDH) as an adjuvant to Brucella subunit vaccine formulations to 
enhance the immune response to the antigen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: LDH and Freund's adjuvant were combined with Brucella 
outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) and OMV-associated proteins to form a subunit 
vaccine, respectively. The immunogenicity of LDH as an adjuvant was assessed in 
BALB/c mice. We examined levels of immunoglobulin G, G1, and G2a (IgG, IgG1, and 
IgG2a) antibodies (aBs); percentages of Cluster of Differentiation 4-positive 
(CD4+) and CD8+ T cells in peripheral-blood lymphocytes; and secretion of 
cytokines in mouse spleen lymphocytes. Finally, splenic index and splenic 
bacterial load were assessed via Brucella challenge experiments on mice.
RESULTS: The LDH subunit vaccine also produced high levels of specific aBs in 
mice compared with Freund's adjuvant subunit vaccine and induced mainly T-helper 
1 cell (Th1)-type immune responses. In addition, mice in the LDH subunit vaccine 
group had significantly lower bacterial loads in their spleens than those in the 
Freund's adjuvant subunit vaccine group, and the LDH-OMV vaccine offered a 
higher level of protection against Brucella attack.
CONCLUSION: LDH as an adjuvant-paired vaccine provided a high level of 
protection against Brucella infection.","DOI: 10.22038/IJBMS.2023.67394.14775

disease is the loss of homeostasis between Th17 and Treg cells, targeting the 
specific molecules of the Th17/Treg axis developmental pathway is a promising 
strategy for inflammatory bowel disease prevention and treatment. The current 
study aimed to assess the impact of cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) extract, 
rich in iridoids and polyphenols known for their potential anti-inflammatory 
activity, at two doses (20 or 100 mg/kg) on the crucial factors for Th17/Treg 
cell differentiation in the course of experimental colitis and compare this 
action with that of sulfasalazine. This study was conducted on the biobank colon 
tissue samples collected during the previous original experiment, in which 
colitis in rats was induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). The levels 
of IL-6, RORγt, total STAT3, p-STAT3, and Foxp3 were determined by ELISA. The 
expression of PIAS3 mRNA was quantified by qPCR. Cornelian cherry extract at a 
dose of 100 mg/kg counteracted the TNBS-induced elevation of IL-6, RORγt, and 
p-STAT3 levels and a decrease in Foxp3 level and PIAS3 mRNA expression, while 
given concomitantly with sulfasalazine was more effective than sulfasalazine 
alone in reversing the TNBS-induced changes in IL-6, RORγt, total STAT3, 
p-STAT3, Foxp3 levels, and PIAS3 mRNA expression. The beneficial effect of 
cornelian cherry extract on experimental colitis may be due to its 
immunomodulatory activity reflected by the influence on factors regulating the

well characterized in Chinese patients. Based on a large cohort of newly 
diagnosed CLL/SLL patients from China, we investigated immunophenotypes, genetic 
abnormalities, and their correlations. Eighty-four percent of the CLL/SLL 
patients showed typical immunophenotypes with scores of 4 or 5 points in the 
Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) scoring system (classic group), and the remaining 
16% of patients were atypical with scores lower than 4 points (atypical group). 
Trisomy 12 and variants of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, ATM, and MYD88 were the most 
recurrent genetic aberrations. Additionally, unsupervised genomic analysis based 
on molecular genetics revealed distinctive characteristics of MYD88 variants in 
CLL/SLL. By overlapping different correlation grouping analysis from genetics to 
immunophenotypes, the results showed MYD88 variants to be highly related to 
atypical CLL/SLL immunophenotypes. Furthermore, compared with mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL), the genetic landscape showed potential value in clinical 
differential diagnosis of atypical CLL/SLL and MCL patients. These results 
reveal immunophenotypic and genetic features, and may provide insights into the 
tumorigenesis and clinical management of Chinese CLL/SLL patients.","DOI: 10.3390/jcm12072667

polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes out of the total somatic cell 
count (SCC) and has been proposed in recent years as a proxy for udder health in 
dairy cows. We investigated phenotypic factors affecting SCC and DSCC using 3978 
records of 212 Alpine Grey and 426 Burlina cows farmed in Northern Italy. The 
linear mixed model accounted for the fixed effects of breed, parity, lactation 
stage, sampling season, and first-order interactions of breed with the other 
effects. Cow, herd-test-date nested within breed were random. Subsequently, four 
udder health status groups (UHS) were created by combining SCC and DSCC to 
assess the UHS impact on milk yield and quality. DSCC was greater in Alpine Grey 
(66.2 ± 0.8%) than Burlina cows (63.2 ± 0.6%) and, similarly to SCC, it 
increased with days in milk and parity regardless of breed. Milk yield and 
composition were affected by UHS in both breeds. These results suggest that also 
udder health of local breeds can be monitored on a large scale through SCC and 
DSCC for reduction in biodiversity loss and increased farm profitability. 
However, in addition to milk data, the introduction of mastitis recording and 
monitoring plans is advisable.","DOI: 10.3390/ani13071249

caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV) with a mortality rate of about 100%. 
However, the understanding of the interaction between ASFV and host is still not 
clear. In this study, the expression differences and functional analysis of 
microRNA (miRNA) in porcine peripheral blood lymphocytes of ASFV infected pigs 
and healthy pigs were compared based on Illumina high-throughput sequencing, 
then the GO and KEGG signal pathways were analyzed. The miRNA related to 
immunity and inflammation were screened, and the regulatory network of 
miRNA-mRNA was drawn. A total of 70 differentially expressed miRNAs were found 
(p ≤ 0.05). Of these, 45 were upregulated and 25 were downregulated in 
ASFV-infected pigs vs. healthy pigs. A total of 8179 mRNA genes targeted by 
these 70 differentially expressed miRNA were predicted, of which 1447 mRNA genes 
were targeted by ssc-miR-2320-5p. Five differentially expressed miRNA were 
validated by RT-qPCR, which were consistent with the RNA-Seq results. The GO 
analysis revealed that a total of 30 gene functions were significantly enriched, 
including 7 molecular functions (MF), 13 cellular components (CC), and 10 
biological processes (BP). The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the 
differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways related 
to immunity, inflammation, and various metabolic processes, in which a total of 
two downregulated miRNAs after infection and eight upregulated miRNAs related to 
immunity and inflammation were screened in ASFV-infected pigs vs. healthy pigs. 
The network of miRNA-mRNA showed that the mRNA target genes were strongly 
regulated by ssc-miR-214, ssc-miR-199b-3p, and ssc-miR-199a-3p. The mRNA target 
genes were enriched into the MAPK signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor 
signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and IL-17 signaling pathway by using a 
KEGG enrichment analysis. Therefore, ASFV could regulate immunity and 
metabolism-related pathways in infected pigs by inducing differential expression 
of miRNAs. These results provided a new basis for further elucidating the 
interactions between ASFV and the host as well as the immunity regulation 
mechanisms of ASFV, which will be conducive to better controlling ASF.","DOI: 10.3390/ani13071246

at drying off. From a One Health perspective, there should be a balance between 
the risk of IMI that may impair cow health and welfare and the reduction of 
antimicrobial usage to decrease antimicrobial resistance, as may happen when 
applying selective dry-cow therapy. This reduction may be achieved by an early 
and accurate diagnosis followed by prudent and rationale therapeutical 
protocols. This study aims to assess the accuracy of PLCC (neutrophils + 
lymphocyte count/mL) in identifying cows at risk of having IMI due to major 
pathogens (S.aureus, Str.agalactiae, Str.uberis, and Str.dysgalactiae), and to 
simulate the impact of this early diagnosis on the potential number of 
treatments using a decision-tree model. The results of this study showed that 
PLCC had an overall accuracy of 77.6%. The results of the decision-tree model 
based on data from the 12 participating herds, with an overall prevalence of 
major pathogens of 1.5%, showed a potential decrease in the number of treatments 
of about 30% (from 3.4% to 2.5%) when PLCC in early lactation (days 5-16) was 
used to identify cows at risk for major pathogens compared with using SCC at the 
first milk test (days 17-43). The study confirmed that it is possible to improve 
animal health and reduce the risk of antimicrobial use through early IMI 
detection based on PLCC and applying a rationale and prudent antimicrobial

system has the ability to control the initiation and development of tumors, 
including gliomas. Thus, immune cells find themselves controlled by various 
molecular pathways, inhibiting their activation, such as the immunosuppressive 
adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR). Our objective was to establish the expression 
profile and role of A2AR at the transcriptomic level, using real-time RT-PCR in 
Moroccan glioma patients, in addition to TCGA and CGGA cohorts. The real-time 
RT-PCR results in Moroccan patients showed that high expression of this gene was 
associated with poor survival in males. Our study on the CGGA cohort 
corroborated these results. In addition, there was a positive association of 
A2AR with T-cell exhaustion genes. A2AR also correlated strongly with genes that 
are primarily enriched in focal adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions, 
inducing epithelial mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and glioma growth. 
However, in the TCGA cohort, the A2AR showed results that were different from 
the two previously examined cohorts. In fact, this gene was instead linked to a 
good prognosis in patients with the astrocytoma histological type. The 
correlation and enrichment results reinforced the prognostic role of A2AR in 
this TCGA cohort, in which its high expression was shown to be related to 
lymphocyte differentiation and a successful cytolytic response, suggesting a 
more efficient anti-tumor immune response. Correlations and differential 
analyses based on A2AR gene expression, to understand the cause of the 
association of this gene with two different prognoses (CGGA males and TCGA 
Astrocytoma), showed that the overexpression of A2AR in Chinese male patients 
could be associated with the overexpression of extracellular adenosine, which 
binds to A2AR to induce immunosuppression and consequently a poor prognosis. 
However, in the second group (TCGA astrocytomas), the overexpression of the gene 
could be associated with an adenosine deficiency, and therefore this receptor 
does not undergo activation. The absence of A2AR activation in these patients 
may have protected them from immunosuppression, which could reflect the good 
prognosis. A2AR can be considered a promising therapeutic target in male CGGA 
and Moroccan patients with gliomas.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24076688

tolerance. Treg dysfunction results in diverse inflammatory and autoimmune 
diseases with life-threatening consequences. β2-integrins (CD11a-d/CD18) play 
important roles in the migration of leukocytes into inflamed tissues and cell 
signaling. Of all β2-integrins, T cells, including Treg, only express 
CD11a/CD18, termed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), on their 
surface. In humans, loss-of-function mutations in the common subunit CD18 result 
in leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-1 (LAD-1). Clinical symptoms vary 
depending on the extent of residual β2-integrin function, and patients may 
experience leukocytosis and recurrent infections. Some patients can develop 
autoimmune diseases, but the immune processes underlying the paradoxical 
situation of immune deficiency and autoimmunity have been scarcely investigated. 
To understand this complex phenotype, different transgenic mouse strains with a 
constitutive knockout of β2-integrins have been established. However, since a 
constitutive knockout affects all leukocytes and may limit the validity of 
studies focusing on their cell type-specific role, we established a 
Treg-specific CD18-floxed mouse strain. This mini-review aims to delineate the 
role of LFA-1 for the induction, maintenance, and regulatory function of Treg in 
vitro and in vivo as deduced from observations using the various 
β2-integrin-deficient mouse models.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24076331

lymphomas; however, the skin may also be affected by lymphomas with large cell 
morphology, as a primary or secondary localization. A minority of cases consist 
of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCLs). PCBCLs are a heterogeneous group 
of rare neoplasms with an overlapping morphological and immunohistochemical 
picture of the different subtypes. Nevertheless, differential diagnosis in the 
setting of this group of neoplasms is mandatory to identify the correct therapy 
and prognosis, but it may be challenging since, due to the rarity of these 
neoplasms, they may not always be familiar to pathologists. Indeed, 
immunohistochemistry may not be enough to distinguish the different histotypes, 
which overlap in immunohistochemical features. Furthermore, the ever-increasing 
knowledge of the molecular features of systemic B-cell lymphomas, such as gene 
rearrangements with clinical significance, has led in recent years to further

and the risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma worldwide. This narrative review intends to elucidate the 
potential impact of milk-related agents, predominantly milk-derived exosomes 
(MDEs) and their microRNAs (miRs) in lymphomagenesis. Upregulation of 
PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 signaling is a common feature of DLBCL. Increased expression of 
B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and suppression of B lymphocyte-induced maturation 
protein 1 (BLIMP1)/PR domain-containing protein 1 (PRDM1) are crucial 
pathological deviations in DLBCL. Translational evidence indicates that during 
the breastfeeding period, human MDE miRs support B cell proliferation via 
epigenetic upregulation of BCL6 (via miR-148a-3p-mediated suppression of DNA 
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and miR-155-5p/miR-29b-5p-mediated suppression of 
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) and suppression of BLIMP1 (via MDE 
let-7-5p/miR-125b-5p-targeting of PRDM1). After weaning with the physiological 
termination of MDE miR signaling, the infant's BCL6 expression and B cell 
proliferation declines, whereas BLIMP1-mediated B cell maturation for adequate 
own antibody production rises. Because human and bovine MDE miRs share identical 
nucleotide sequences, the consumption of pasteurized cow's milk in adults with 
the continued transfer of bioactive bovine MDE miRs may de-differentiate B cells 
back to the neonatal ""proliferation-dominated"" B cell phenotype maintaining an 
increased BLC6/BLIMP1 ratio. Persistent milk-induced epigenetic dysregulation of 
BCL6 and BLIMP1 expression may thus represent a novel driving mechanism in B 
cell lymphomagenesis. Bovine MDEs and their miR cargo have to be considered 
potential pathogens that should be removed from the human food chain.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24076102

regulatory T cells (Tregs) in psoriasis (PsO) pathogenesis. However, the genetic 
background of Treg dysfunctions remains unknown. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the association of PsO development with selected single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes in which protein products play a significant role 
in the regulation of differentiation and function of Tregs. There were three 
study groups in our research and each consisted of different unrelated patients 
and controls: 192 PsO patients and 5605 healthy volunteers in the microarray 
genotyping group, 150 PsO patients and 173 controls in the ARMS-PCR method 
group, and 6 PsO patients and 6 healthy volunteers in the expression analysis 
group. The DNA microarrays analysis (283 SNPs of 57 genes) and ARMS-PCR method 
(8 SNPs in 7 genes) were used to determine the frequency of occurrence of SNPs 
in selected genes. The mRNA expression of selected genes was determined in skin 
samples. There were statistically significant differences in the allele 
frequencies of four SNPs in three genes (TNF, IL12RB2, and IL12B) between 
early-onset PsO patients and controls. The lowest p-value was observed for 
rs3093662 (TNF), and the G allele carriers had a 2.73 times higher risk of 
developing early-onset PsO. Moreover, the study revealed significant differences 
in the frequency of SNPs and their influence on PsO development between early- 
and late-onset PsO. Based on the ARMS-PCR method, the association between some 
polymorphisms of four genes (IL4, IL10, TGFB1, and STAT3) and the risk of 
developing PsO was noticed. Psoriatic lesions were characterized with a lower 
mRNA expression of FOXP3, CTLA4, and IL2, and a higher expression of TNF and 
IL1A in comparison with unaffected skin. In conclusion, the genetic background 
associated with properly functioning Tregs seems to play a significant role in 
PsO pathogenesis and could have diagnostic value.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24076061

datasets and patient tissue samples. We also explored the differentiation 
characteristics of genes by pseudo-temporal analysis and assessed their 
diagnostic performance and drug sensitivity by molecular docking. Finally, we 
extended this study to the prognosis of IBD-associated colon cancer. 
TNF-centered 5-gene diagnostic model not only has excellent diagnostic efficacy, 
but is also closely associated with KRAS, P53, and IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathways and

enhance systemic anti-tumor T cell responses. Here, using two mouse tumor 
models, we demonstrate that adding long-acting CD122-directed IL-2 complexes 
(IL-2c) to RT/anti-PD1 further increases tumor-specific CD8+ T cell numbers. The 
highest increase (>50-fold) is found in the blood circulation. Compartmental 
analysis of exhausted T cell subsets shows that primarily undifferentiated, 
stem-like, tumor-specific CD8+ T cells expand in the blood; these cells express 
the chemokine receptor CXCR3, which is required for migration into tumors. In 
tumor tissue, effector-like but not terminally differentiated exhausted CD8+ T 
cells increase. Consistent with the surge in tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in 
blood that are migration and proliferation competent, we observe a CD8-dependent 
and CXCR3-dependent enhancement of the abscopal effect against 
distant/non-irradiated tumors and find that CD8+ T cells isolated from blood 
after RT/anti-PD1/IL-2c triple treatment can be a rich source of tumor-specific

constitutes a revolutionary advance for treatment of relapsed/refractory 
hematological malignancies. Nevertheless, cytokine release and immune effector 
cell-associated neurotoxicity syndromes are life-threatening toxicities in which 
the endothelium could be a pathophysiological substrate. Furthermore, 
differential diagnosis from sepsis, highly incident in these patients, is 
challenging. Suitable laboratory tools could be determinant for their 
appropriate management.
METHODS: Sixty-two patients treated with CAR-T cell immunotherapy for 
hematological malignancies (n=46 with CD19-positive diseases, n=16 with multiple 
myeloma) were included. Plasma samples were obtained: before CAR-T cell infusion 
(baseline); after 24-48 hours; at suspicion of any toxicity onset and 
24-48 hours after immunomodulatory treatment. Biomarkers of endothelial 
dysfunction (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), soluble TNF 
receptor 1 (sTNFRI), thrombomodulin (TM), soluble suppression of tumorigenesis-2 
factor (ST2), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)), innate immunity activation (neutrophil 
extracellular traps (NETs), soluble C5b-9 (sC5b-9)) and hemostasis/fibrinolysis 
(von Willebrand Factor antigen (VWF:Ag), ADAMTS-13 (A13), α2-antiplasmin 
(α2-AP), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (PAI-1 Ag)) were measured and 
compared with those in cohorts of patients with sepsis and healthy donors.
RESULTS: Patients who developed CAR-T cell toxicities presented increased levels 
of sVCAM-1, sTNFRI and ST2 at the clinical onset versus postinfusion values. 
Twenty-four hours after infusion, ST2 levels were good predictors of any CAR-T 
cell toxicity, and combination of ST2, Ang-2 and NETs differentiated patients 
requiring intensive care unit admission from those with milder clinical 
presentations. Association of Ang-2, NETs, sC5b-9, VWF:Ag and PAI-1 Ag showed 
excellent discrimination between severe CAR-T cell toxicities and sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides relevant contributions to the current knowledge 
of the CAR-T cell toxicities pathophysiology. Markers of endotheliopathy, innate 
immunity activation and hemostatic imbalance appear as potential laboratory 
tools for their prediction, severity and differential diagnosis.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

Regardless of the designation however, these tumors are known to show a spectrum 
of histopathological growth patterns that may pose challenges in interpretation

Just like any other type of thymoma, those composed predominantly of epithelioid 
cells may present as encapsulated or invasive tumors. Nevertheless, compared to 
other subtypes of thymoma, they are uncommon neoplasms. Therefore, it becomes 
very important to sufficiently sample thymomas before making a diagnosis of a 
particular subtype, especially when the tumor is rich in epithelioid cells and 
only has a scant lymphocytic component. Because of the unusual occurrence of 
these tumors, there are only few large series of cases that attempt to highlight

bioregulators (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly-Epitalon; Lys-Glu-Asp-Ala-Livagen; 
Ala-Glu-Asp-Pro - Cortagen and Lys-Glu - Vilon) on condensed chromatin in 
lymphocytes from old individuals. Were used molecular-cytogenetic methods: 
differential scanning calorimetry; activity of ribosomal genes of acrocentric 
chromosome satellite stalks-NORs; polymorphism of structural pericentromeric 
C-heterochromatin; variability of the facultative heterochromatin (sister 
chromatid exchanges - SCE) in the culture of lymphocytes from 75-88-year-old 
individuals. The analysis of results shows the chromosome progressive 
heterochromatinization (condensation of eu - and heterochromatin regions) occur 
in aging. Epigenetics process - heterochromatinization can deactivate many 
previously functioning active genes. It blocks certain stages of normal 
metabolic processes in the cell, which inhibits many specific enzymes and leads 
to aging pathologies. We show that peptide bioregulators induced unrolling 
deheterochromatinization (decondensation) of total heterochromatin, 
deheterochromatinization of satellite stalks of acrocentric chromosome, 
activating synthetic processes of ribosomal genes, does not cause 
deheterochromatinized of pericentromeric structural heterochromatin. This data 
also indicates that each of the studied peptide bioregulators (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly; 
Lys-Glu-Asp-Ala; Ala-Glu-Asp-Pro and Lys-Glu) has a selective effect on definite 
regions of chromosomes. Thus, short peptide bioregulators induce selective 
heterochromatinization and deheterochromatinization of chromosome regions 
(remodeling of facultative heterochromatin) in individuals 75-88 years old that 
opens up new opportunities in the treatment of aging diseases.",PMID: 37042594 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

prime combined with DNA boost and DNA prime combined with protein boost, 
respectively, against heartwater infection via needle challenge. To localise its 
antigenic regions for inclusion in a multi-epitope DNA vaccine against 
heartwater, Erum2510 was cleaved into five overlapping subfragments. These 
subfragments were expressed individually in an Escherichia coli host expression 
system and evaluated for their ability to induce proliferative responses, Th1 
and Th2 cytokines (interferon gamma [IFN-γ] and interleukin 4 [IL-4]) via 
enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot), quantitative real time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry. Recombinant (r)proteins 3 and 4 were 
shown to induce immunodominant Th1 and Th2 immune responses characterised by the 
secretion of effector cytokines IFN-γ and IL-4 in addition to differential 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), 
IL-2, IL-1, IL-18, IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF),

the past 40 years. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in the 
progression of osteosarcoma. This study aims to determine immune-associated 
prognostic biomarkers for osteosarcoma patients. With the help of analytical 
tools including ESTIMATE, differential gene expression, LASSO, and univariate 
cox and multivariate cox regression analysis, osteosarcoma gene expression data 
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were investigated. Following the 
establishment of a prognostic risk score model, internal and external 
validations using the GEO and TARGET databases were carried out. A total of 44 
and 55 samples respectively in the GSE21257 and the TARGET databases were 
included. Our analysis found 93 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
the high and low-ImmuneScore groups. Through univariate cox and LASSO analysis, 
ALOX5AP was identified as an indicator of TME in osteosarcomas. ALOX5AP was then 
used to construct a prognostic risk model. Internal and external verification 
revealed that higher expression of ALOX5AP was correlated with lower risk. 
Through the CIBERSORT algorithm, the level of CD8 T cells was found to 
negatively correlate with the risk score. This study revealed that ALOX5AP is an 
indicator for predicting high CD8 lymphocyte infiltration and ""hot"" tumor 
microenvironment in osteosarcomas. Thus, ALOX5AP has the potential to act as a

defense against bacteria and infection and a vulnerable organ that is easily

exhibits broad pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, 
immune-regulation and liver protection. In this study, we investigated the 
cellular responses in liver to sepsis infection and ART hepatic-protective 
mechanisms against sepsis. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis 
model was established in mice. The mice were administered ART (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 
at 4 h, and sacrificed at 12 h after the surgery. Liver samples were collected 
for preparing single-cell RNA transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq). The 
scRNA-seq analysis revealed that sepsis-induced a dramatic reduction of hepatic 
endothelial cells, especially the subtypes characterized with proliferation and 
differentiation. Macrophages were recruited during sepsis and released 
inflammatory cytokines (Tnf, Il1b, Il6), chemokines (Ccl6, Cd14), and 
transcription factor (Nfkb1), resulting in liver inflammatory responses. Massive 
apoptosis of lymphocytes and abnormal recruitment of neutrophils caused immune 
dysfunction. ART treatment significantly improved the survival of CLP mice 
within 96 h, and partially relieved or reversed the above-mentioned pathological 
features, mitigating the impact of sepsis on liver injury, inflammation, and 
dysfunction. This study provides comprehensive fundamental proof for the liver 
protective efficacy of ART against sepsis infection, which would potentially 
contribute to its clinical translation for sepsis therapy. Single cell 
transcriptome reveals the changes of various hepatocyte subtypes of CLP-induced 
liver injury and the potential pharmacological effects of artesunate on sepsis.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shanghai Institute of Materia

Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology Workshop within the 
category of B-cell lineage neoplasms' transdifferentiation into 
histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms (HDCNs).
METHODS: The workshop panel reviewed 29 cases, assigned consensus diagnoses, and 
summarized findings.
RESULTS: The specific diagnoses of transdifferentiated HDCN tumors were 
histiocytic sarcoma (16); Langerhans cell histiocytosis/sarcoma (5); 
indeterminate DC tumor (1); and HDCN, unclassifiable (1). Approximately 
one-third of the patients reviewed had follicular lymphoma; lymphoblastic 
leukemia/lymphoma; or another B-cell lymphoma, most commonly chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. There was a 3:1 preponderance toward women, 
median patient age was 60 years, and the median interval between the initial 
diagnosis of B-cell lineage neoplasm and HDCN was 4 to 5 years. The submitted 
cases have demonstrated substantial heterogeneity as well as overlapping 
immunophenotypic and other features. Comprehensive genomic DNA sequencing 
revealed alterations enriched in the MAPK pathway. Based on shared and distinct 
alterations seen in HDCNs and the preceding lymphomas, both linear and divergent 
clonal evolutionary pathways were inferred. Furthermore, RNA sequencing 
performed in a subset of cases yielded new insights into markers that could be 
useful for more precise cell lineage identification. The panel has thus proposed 
an updated algorithm for HDCN lineage assignment. The outcome of 
transdifferentiated HDCNs was poor, but the MAPK signaling pathway emerges as a 
potentially attractive therapeutic target.
CONCLUSIONS: Transdifferentiated HDCNs demonstrate heterogeneity and pose 
diagnostic challenges with regard to exact classification, but the in-depth 
characterization of the submitted cases have added to our understanding of the 
secondary HDCNs transdifferentiated from B-cell lymphoma/leukemia. Continuous 
efforts focusing on deciphering the specific cell lineage and differentiation 
state of these tumors will be critical for their accurate classification. 
Comprehensive molecular characterization of HDCNs may be informative in this 
regard. With the list of novel pharmacologic inhibitors of the MAPK pathway 
continuing to expand, improved outcomes for HDCN can be expected.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of American

phase, proinflammatory conditions increase the amount of circulating 
phosphatidylserine+ (PS) extracellular vesicles (EVs). These EVs interact 
especially with CD8+ T cells; however, it remains unclear whether they can 
actively modulate CD8+ T cell responses. In this study, we have developed a 
method to analyze cell-bound PS+ EVs and their target cells in vivo. We show 
that EV+ cell abundance increases during viral infection and that EVs 
preferentially bind to activated, but not naive, CD8+ T cells. Superresolution 
imaging revealed that PS+ EVs attach to clusters of CD8 molecules on the T cell 
surface. Furthermore, EV-binding induces antigen (Ag)-specific TCR signaling and 
increased nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Nuclear factor of 
activated T-cells (NFATc1) in vivo. EV-decorated but not EV-free CD8+ T cells 
are enriched for gene signatures associated with T-cell receptor signaling,

(CDK5) in a true population-based cohort of patients with colon cancer.
METHODS: 1. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to retrospectively 
analyse the expression of CDK5 in colon cancer tissue samples of 296 patients. 
The χ2 test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional regression model were used 
to analyse the difference between the patients with differential expression of 
CDK5 and with different stages (metastatic and nonmetastatic); 2. The number of 
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumour sections was determined, and 
its relationship with prognosis was explored.
RESULTS: 1. Among 296 patients stained for CDK5, 18 cases (6.09%) showed 
negative expression, 77 cases (26.01%) showed weak expression (+1), 124 cases 
(41.89%) showed medium positive expression (2+), and 77 cases (26.01%) showed 
strong positive expression (3+). The expression of CDK5 was neither related to 
mismatch repair nor TILs (p > .05). In non-metastatic patients, longer 
progression-free survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were observed 
in patients with high CDK5 expression (2+ or 3+) than low CDK5 expression (- or 
1+), while in metastatic disease, the opposite was true (p < .001). 2. TILs in 
226 patients were detected in the study. Among them, 115 cases (50.88%) showed a 
low number of TILs (TILs-L), and 111 cases (49.12%) showed a high number of TILs 
(TILs-H). Patients with a TIL ratio greater than .2 had a significantly better 
CSS (p < .001) or PFS (p = .008) than patients with a lower TIL ratio. By 
multivariate analysis, TILs-H was a protective factor for CSS, however failed to 
reach a significant difference (hazard ratio: .59, 95% CI: .33∼1.06, p = .079), 
and so was the PFS (HR: .65, 95% CI: .29∼1.43, p = .279).
CONCLUSION: High expression of CDK5 indicates a good prognosis in nonmetastatic 
colon cancer, while it is the opposite in metastatic colon cancer, and the 
expression of CDK5 is unrelated to TILs. Patients with TIL-H have a better 
prognosis, with a proper cut-off value of 20% for colon cancer.","DOI: 10.1177/10732748231169396

exhausted T cells with functional and phenotypic differences that dictate 
whether the infection is cleared or progresses to chronicity. High CD38 
expression has been observed on CD8+ T cells across various viral infections and 
tumors in patients, suggesting an important regulatory function for CD38 on 
responding T cells. Here, we show that CD38 expression was increased and 
sustained on exhausted CD8+ T cells following chronic lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, with lower levels observed on T cells 
from acute LCMV infection. We uncovered a cell-intrinsic role for CD38 
expression in regulating the survival of effector and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We 
observed increased proliferation and function of Cd38-/- CD8+ progenitor 
exhausted T cells compared to those of wild-type (WT) cells. Furthermore, 
decreased oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic potential were observed in 
Cd38-/- CD8+ T cells during chronic but not acute LCMV infection. Our studies 
reveal that CD38 has a dual cell-intrinsic function in CD8+ T cells, where it 
decreases proliferation and function yet supports their survival and metabolism. 
These findings show that CD38 is not only a marker of T cell activation but also 
has regulatory functions on effector and exhausted CD8+ T cells. IMPORTANCE Our 
study shows how CD38 expression is regulated on CD8+ T cells responding during 
acute and chronic viral infection. We observed higher CD38 levels on CD8+ T 
cells during chronic viral infection compared to levels during acute viral 
infection. Deleting CD38 had an important cell-intrinsic function in ensuring 
the survival of virus-specific CD8+ T cells throughout the course of viral 
infection. We found defective metabolism in Cd38-/- CD8+ T cells arising during 
chronic infection and changes in their progenitor T cell phenotype. Our studies 
revealed a dual cell-intrinsic role for CD38 in limiting proliferation and 
granzyme B production in virus-specific exhausted T cells while also promoting 
their survival. These data highlight new avenues for research into the 
mechanisms through which CD38 regulates the survival and metabolism of CD8+ T 
cell responses to viral infections.","DOI: 10.1128/jvi.00225-23

    bioRxiv. 2023 Feb 15;:","The activation of Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) by S1P promotes 
lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs, a process critical for immune 
surveillance and T cell effector activity. Multiple drugs that inhibit S1PR1 
function are in use clinically for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Cluster 
of Differentiation 69 (CD69) is an endogenous negative regulator of lymphocyte 
egress that interacts with S1PR1 in cis to facilitate internalization and 
degradation of the receptor. The mechanism by which CD69 causes S1PR1 
internalization has been unclear. Moreover, although there are numerous class A 
GPCR structures determined with different small molecule agonists bound, it 
remains unknown whether a transmembrane protein per se can act as a class A GPCR 
agonist. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of CD69-bound S1PR1 coupled to 
the heterotrimeric Gi complex. The transmembrane helix (TM) of one protomer of 
CD69 homodimer contacts the S1PR1-TM4. This interaction allosterically induces 
the movement of S1PR1-TMs 5-6, directly activating the receptor to engage the 
heterotrimeric Gi. Mutations in key residues at the interface affect the 
interactions between CD69 and S1PR1, as well as reduce the receptor 
internalization. Thus, our structural findings along with functional analyses 
demonstrate that CD69 acts in cis as a protein agonist of S1PR1, thereby 
promoting Gi-dependent S1PR1 internalization, loss of S1P gradient sensing, and 
inhibition of lymphocyte egress.","© 2023, Chen et al.","DOI: 10.7554/eLife.88204

currently in clinical trials. The creation of patient-specific iPSCs makes 
personalized therapy possible due to their main advantage of immunotolerance. 
However, some reports have claimed recently that aberrant gene expression 
followed by proteome alterations and neoantigen formation can result in iPSCs 
recognition by autologous T-cells. Meanwhile, the possibility of NK-cell 
activation has not been previously considered. This study focused on the 
comparison of autologous and allogeneic immune response to iPSC-derived cells 
and isogeneic parental somatic cells used for reprogramming.
METHODS: We established an isogeneic cell model consisting of parental dermal 
fibroblasts, fibroblast-like iPSC-derivatives (iPS-fibro) and iPS-fibro lacking 
beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Using the cells obtained from two patients, we 
analyzed the activation of autologous and allogeneic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells 
co-cultured with target cells.
RESULTS: Here we report that cells differentiated from iPSCs can be recognized 
by NK-cells rather than by autologous T-cells. We observed that iPS-fibro 
elicited a high level of NK-cell degranulation and cytotoxicity, while isogeneic 
parental skin fibroblasts used to obtain iPSCs barely triggered an NK-cell 
response. iPSC-derivatives with B2M knockout did not cause an additional 
increase in NK-cell activation, although they were devoid of HLA-I, the major 
inhibitory molecules for NK-cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant 
imbalance of ligands for activating and inhibitory NK-cell receptors in 
iPS-fibro. Compared to parental fibroblasts, iPSC-derivatives had a reduced 
expression of HLA-I simultaneously with an increased gene expression of major 
activating ligands, such as MICA, NECTIN2, and PVR. The lack of inhibitory 
signals might be due to insufficient maturity of cells differentiated from 
iPSCs. In addition, we showed that pretreatment of iPS-fibro with 
proinflammatory cytokine IFNγ restored the ligand imbalance, thereby reducing 
the degranulation and cytotoxicity of NK-cells.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we showed that iPSC-derived cells can be sensitive to 
the cytotoxic potential of autologous NK-cells regardless of HLA-I status. Thus, 
the balance of ligands for NK-cell receptors should be considered prior to 
iPSC-based cell therapies. Trial registration Not applicable.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13287-023-03308-5

in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune disorders, such as psoriasis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, steroid-resistant asthma, and 
multiple sclerosis. The master transcription factor retinoid-related orphan 
receptor gamma t (RORγt), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays a vital role in 
inducing Th17-cell differentiation. Recent findings suggest that metabolic 
control is critical for Th17-cell differentiation, particularly through the 
engagement of de novo lipid biosynthesis. Inhibition of lipid biosynthesis, 
either through the use of pharmacological inhibitors or by the deficiency of 
related enzymes in CD4+ T cells, results in significant suppression of Th17-cell 
differentiation. Mechanistic studies indicate that metabolic fluxes through both

controlling RORγt activity through the generation of a lipid ligand of RORγt.

lipid metabolism in the differentiation and function of Th17 cells, as well as

and annually >50,000 individuals will die of CRC, necessitating improvements in 
screening, prognostication, disease management, and therapeutic options. CRC 
tumors are removed en bloc with surrounding vasculature and lymphatics. 
Examination of regional lymph nodes at the time of surgical resection is 
essential for prognostication. Developing alternative approaches to indirectly 
assess recurrence risk would have utility in cases where lymph node yield is 
incomplete or inadequate. Spatially dependent, immune cell-specific (eg, 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes), proteomic, and transcriptomic expression 
patterns inside and around the tumor-the tumor immune microenvironment-can 
predict nodal/distant metastasis and probe the coordinated immune response from 
the primary tumor site. The comprehensive characterization of tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes and other immune infiltrates is possible using highly multiplexed 
spatial omics technologies, such as the GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler. In this 
study, machine learning and differential co-expression analyses helped identify 
biomarkers from Digital Spatial Profiler-assayed protein expression patterns

extracellular matrix remodeling (eg, GZMB and fibronectin), immune suppression 
(eg, FOXP3), exhaustion and cytotoxicity (eg, CD8), PD-L1-expressing dendritic

Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is ineffective due to its 
immunological cold tumor nature. Herein, we prepared a nanodrug (NCG) 
encapsulating the transforming growth factor-β receptor inhibitor galunisertib 
(Gal) and the sonosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), which was aimed to turn this type 
of cold tumor into a hot one to promote the ICB-based immunotherapy against it. 
After delivery to the tumor, NCG under ultrasonic irradiation generated reactive 
oxygen species causing tumor immunogenic cell death and releasing 
immunostimulatory signals such as calreticulin and HMGB1, which increased tumor 
immunogenicity and activated the innate T lymphocyte immune response. Moreover, 
NCG responded to the acidic microenvironment and released Gal, inhibiting 
phosphorylation and inducing immunosuppressive Smad2/3 signaling. Consequently, 
the differentiation of MDSCs was inhibited, M1-like polarization of 
tumor-associated macrophages was induced, and the immunosuppressive barrier of 
tumor-associated fibroblasts was destroyed to increase the infiltration of 
effector T cells, which reversed the immunosuppression of the tumor 
microenvironment and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibodies. 
Notably, in the liver metastasis mouse model, combination therapy using NCG (+) 
and aPD-L1 inhibited the growth of colon cancer liver metastasis, manifesting 
potential in treating this popular yet intractable malignancy. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE: Only a limited number of patients with colorectal cancer and liver 
metastasis can benefit from immune checkpoint blockade therapy, as most of them 
are microsatellite stable, immunologically cold tumors. Interestingly, there is 
compelling evidence that sonodynamic therapy (SDT) can convert immunosuppressed 
cold tumors into hot ones, trigger tumor immunogenic cell death non-invasively, 
and boost cytotoxic T cells infiltration. However, its therapeutic efficacy is 
constrained by the abundance of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) cytokines 
in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we reported a TGF-β-targeted inhibitory 
nanodrug that improved SDT in colon cancer and liver metastasis, reversed the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and boosted the immune response to 
anti-PD-L1 therapy in this cancer. It demonstrated the potential to cure this 
prevalent but incurable malignancy.","Copyright © 2023 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Disruption of intestinal barrier function and an imbalance in 
intestinal immunity are crucial for the occurrence and development of ulcerative 
colitis. Because of their important roles in regulating inflammation and 
immunity, exosomes (Exos) released from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 
(BMSCs) may be useful for treating ulcerative colitis. The EphB/EphrinB 
signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the inflammatory process and the 
development and function of immune cells, and can mediate long-distance 
intercellular communication through extracellular vesicles. This study was 
conducted to explore the effects of pre-modified BMSC-Exos expressing EphB2 
(EphB2-Exos) on immunoregulation in vitro.
METHODS: We transfected a lentivirus vector encoding EphB2 into BMSCs and 
isolated EphB2-Exos from the culture supernatant. Inflammation and oxidative 
damage in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) were induced by 
dextran sulfate sodium/hydrogen peroxide. In addition, spleen CD4+ T lymphocytes 
of rats were sorted in vitro. We conducted a series of experiments to explore 
the biological functions of EphB2-Exos.
RESULTS: EphB2-Exos were successfully isolated and were found to significantly 
protect the activity, proliferation, and migration of Caco-2 cells that were 
inhibited by dextran sulfate sodium. EphB2-Exos alleviated inflammation and 
apoptosis and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes while inhibiting 
oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells. EphB2-Exos restored intestinal barrier 
function by inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK pathway and regulated the polarization of 
CD4+T cells.
CONCLUSION: EphB2-Exos enhanced intestinal barrier function and regulated the 
immune balance by inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK pathway in vitro. These findings 
suggest that EphB2-Exos can be applied as a cell-free therapy for ulcerative 
colitis.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","DOI: 10.1007/s10529-023-03358-y

are only formulated with FDA-approved alum-based adjuvants, which poorly elicit 
a lasting immune response, hence the need for a more effective adjuvant system. 
This study evaluated the immunogenicity and toxicity of eggshell membranes (ESM) 
when administered as an adjuvant for the recombinant HBV vaccine (rHBsAg) in 
albino mice. Differential white blood cell analysis, as well as the titer 
measurement of Immunoglobulin G, subclass G1 and G2a on indirect ELISA, was 
performed to measure the immune-modulatory potentials of ESM. Moreover, analysis 
of the liver marker enzyme (AST and ALT) and body/liver weights was performed to 
ascertain the toxicity level of ESM. Finally, Immuno-informatic analysis was 
used to investigate the immune-modulatory potential of individual member 
proteins of ESM.
RESULTS: Our results showed a significant improvement in the experimental 
group's lymphocyte count after boost-dose administration compared to the 
controls, whereas there was no significant change in the granulocyte population. 
Furthermore, the formulations (ESM-rHBsAg) significantly improved IgG and IgG1 
titers after each successive immunization. Body/liver weight and liver function 
showed ESM non-toxic to mice. The immunoinformatic analysis discovered 
ovalbumin, lysozyme-C, and UFM-1 as the member proteins of ESM with 
immune-modulatory activities of activating antigen-presenting cells (APC).
CONCLUSION: This study has provided a clue into the potential valorization of 
eggshell membranes and their peptides as an adjuvant for vaccines such as HBV. 
We recommend more in-depth molecular analysis to support our findings as well as 
foster real-life application.

preoperative lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) after primary surgery in 
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients using a propensity score matching (PSM) 
analysis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive EOC patients who underwent 
primary surgery between January 2008 and December 2019. Patients were divided 
into two groups according to the optimal cutoff value of preoperative LMR. PSM 
(1:1) was conducted to eliminate confounding factors. A Cox proportional hazards 
model and the Kaplan-Meier estimator were employed to investigate the potential 
prognostic factors.
RESULTS: A total of 368 EOC patients were included in this study. The optimal 
cutoff value of LMR was identified as 4.65. Low preoperative LMR was 
significantly correlated with low albumin, high CA125 level, more blood loss, a 
high likelihood of ascites, advanced FIGO stage, and poor differentiation (all p 
< 0.05). After matching, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the group with LMR < 
4.65 experienced significantly shorter OS (p = 0.015). Multivariate Cox analysis 
revealed that low LMR (HR = 1.49, p = 0.041), advanced FIGO stage (HR = 5.25, p 
< 0.001), and undefined residual disease (HR = 3.77, p = 0.002) were independent 
factors in predicting poor OS. A forest plot revealed that LMR had better 
prognostic value in younger EOC patients, patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and 
albumin ≥ 35 g/L, CA125 ≥ 35 U/L, patients who had undergone optimal surgery, 
and those who had completed chemotherapy. Additionally, low-LMR patients who had 
undergone incomplete chemotherapy had a shorter median OS compared with those 
who completed chemotherapy treatment (48.5 vs. 105.9 months, p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: LMR could be used as an independent prognostic factor for EOC 
patients after primary surgery; a noticeable negative effect of LMR was observed 
among EOC patients with age < 65, good preoperative nutritional status, and more 
aggressive tumor biology, and among those who underwent optimal surgery. 
Completing adjuvant chemotherapy is essential to improve survival outcomes among 
EOC patients with LMR < 4.65 after surgery.","Copyright © 2023 Hu, Shen, Li, Xie, Ma, Jiang and Lv.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1139929

Virus Entry Mediator (HVEM, TNFRSF14) is a common clinical finding in a wide 
variety of human tumors, including those of hematological origin.
METHODS: We have addressed how HVEM expression on A20 leukemia cells influences 
tumor survival and its involvement in the modulation of the anti-tumor immune 
responses in a parental into F1 mouse tumor model of hybrid resistance by 
knocking-out HVEM expression. HVEM WT or HVEM KO leukemia cells were then 
injected intravenously into semiallogeneic F1 recipients and the extent of tumor 
dissemination was evaluated.
RESULTS: The loss of HVEM expression on A20 leukemia cells led to a significant 
increase of lymphoid and myeloid tumor cell infiltration curbing tumor 
progression. NK cells and to a lesser extent NKT cells and monocytes were the 
predominant innate populations contributing to the global increase of immune 
infiltrates in HVEM KO tumors compared to that present in HVEM KO tumors. In the 
overall increase of the adaptive T cell immune infiltrates, the stem cell-like 
PD-1- T cells progenitors and the effector T cell populations derived from them 
were more prominently present than terminally differentiated PD-1+ T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the PD-1- T cell subpopulation is likely 
to be a more relevant contributor to tumor rejection than the PD-1+ T cell 
subpopulation. These findings highlight the role of co-inhibitory signals 
delivered by HVEM upon engagement of BTLA on T cells and NK cells, placing 
HVEM/BTLA interaction in the spotlight as a novel immune checkpoint for the 
reinforcement of the anti-tumor responses in malignancies of hematopoietic 
origin.","Copyright © 2023 del Rio, de Juan, Roncador, Caleiras, Álvarez-Esteban,

outcomes in patients with classical hairy cell leukemia (cHCL) and HCL variant 
(HCL-V). Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. Between January 
2011 and December 2021, clinical data of 30 patients newly with diagnosed HCL at 
Peking Union Medical College Hospital were analyzed. The main outcome measures 
include clinical characteristics, treatment efficacy and survival. The 
Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Results: Twenty-one cases of 
cHCL and 9 cases of HCL-v were included. The median age at diagnosis was 55.5 
(range, 30-86) years, with the ratio of male to female 2.75∶1. The main clinical 
manifestations included fatigue in 11 cases (36.7%), abdominal distension in 7 
cases (23.3%), and infection in 4 cases, while 8 cases were asymptomatic. 
Splenomegaly was reported in 24 cases (80.0%), including 7 (23.3%) with 
megalosplenia. The white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, and the proportion 
of peripheral hairy cells in HCL-v group were significantly higher than those in 
cHCL group, whereas the development of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and 
monocytopenia in cHCL group was more remarkable than that in HCL-v group (all 
P<0.05). The BRAF-V600E gene mutation was detected only in cHCL patients (11/14 
vs. 0/9, P<0.001). In terms of immunophenotype, the expression of CD25, CD103, 
CD123 and CD200 in cHCL group (20/20, 20/20, 4/7, 7/17) were all stronger than 
those in HCL-v group (3/9, 7/9, 0/4, 2/8). Twenty-two patients were treated, of 
which 13 cases (12 cases of cHCL and 1 case of HCL-v) with cladribine, and 9 
cases (4 cHCL and 5 HCL-v) with interferon. Complete remission rate and overall 
response rate were comparable between cladribine and interferon treatment groups 
(both P<0.05). The median follow-up time was 31 (range, 1-125) months, and the 
median overall survival (OS) of the entire group was 125 months. The 5-year OS 
rate in HCL-v patients represented a trend of inferior (50.0% vs. 95.0%, 
P=0.207). Conclusions: The clinical features of HCL are unspecific, which 
includes fatigue, splenomegaly and recurrent infection. The clinical features, 
immunophenotype, treatment response and prognosis of HCL-v are different from 
those of cHCL. BRAF-V600E gene mutation is suggested as a key marker for 
differential diagnosis. Cladribine is recommended as front-line regimen of cHCL 
patients with satisfactory efficacy and prognosis. Conversely, response and 
clinical outcome in HCL-v patients still need to be improved.","Publisher: 目的： 分析经典型毛细胞白血病（cHCL）和变异型毛细胞白血病（HCL-v）的临床特征、治疗疗效及生存，并进行对比。 方法：

30例患者包括21例cHCL和9例HCL-v。诊断时年龄30~86岁，中位年龄为55.5岁；男女比例为2.75∶1。主要临床表现包括乏力11例（36.7%）、腹胀7例（23.3%）和感染4例，8例无临床症状。诊断时脾大者24例（80.0%），其中巨脾7例（23.3%）。HCL-v患者外周血白细胞计数、淋巴细胞计数及外周血毛细胞比例均显著高于cHCL患者，而cHCL患者出现贫血、血小板减低、单核细胞减低的比例显著高于HCL-v患者，差异均有统计学意义（均P<0.05）。cHCL患者中BRAF-V600E基因突变的阳性率显著高于HCL-v患者（11/14比0/9，P<0.001）。免疫表型方面，cHCL患者CD25、CD103、CD123和CD200的表达率（20/20、20/20、4/7、7/17）均高于HCL-v患者（3/9、7/9、0/4、2/8）。30例患者中22例接受治疗，13例（12例cHCL、1例HCL-v）采用克拉屈滨方案，9例（4例cHCL、5例HCL-v）采用干扰素治疗。克拉曲滨与干扰素治疗的完全缓解率及总反应率差异均无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。中位随访时间为31个月（范围1~125个月）。生存曲线分析显示，总体患者的中位总生存时间为125个月，HCL-v患者相比cHCL患者5年总生存率呈现劣势（50.0%比95.0%），但差异无统计学意义（P=0.207）。 
结论： 
HCL的临床特征缺乏特异性，主要包括乏力、脾大和反复感染。HCL-v临床特征、免疫表型、治疗反应及预后均与cHCL有差异，BRAF-V600E基因突变是区分二者的重要依据。cHCL患者应用克拉曲滨治疗反应率高，预后满意，而HCL-v的疗效及预后仍有待改善。.","DOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20220414-00274

plant that has an ethnopharmacological indication in the southern region of 
Brazil, in the Araucaria Forest biome. It's used as an alternative therapy for 
respiratory diseases for men and animals since the ""tropeirista"" movement in 
colonial Brazil.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Investigate the influence of oral administration of 
hydroalcoholic extract of C. spicata (HECS) on cellular inflammatory processes 
in the airways of mice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The HECS was obtained by the ultrasound-assisted 
technique. Phytochemical analysis of the volatile compounds was performed using 
gas-chromatography with mass spectrometry. To investigate the biological 
activity of HECS, the animals were pre-treated with HECS orally 1 h before and 
the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) model was used, in which the animals were 
subjected to inhalation of different pro-inflammatory agents such as carrageenan 
(CAR), histamine (HIST), capsaicin (CAP), bradykinin (BK), and 48/80 compound 
(C48/80). After sacrifice, BAL sample was collected from the bronchi and was 
analyzed for total and differential white blood cell counts, compared with 
control groups.
RESULTS: Fourteen volatile phytocompounds were identified in the HECS, the main 
ones being 2-bornanone, menthofuran and camphene. Among the HECS treated 
animals, all showed significant maximal inhibition (MI) when challenged with 
pro-inflammatory agents by nebulization. In the group of animals that received 
CAR, the MI was 72.77 ± 3.88%, compared to the negative control (NC). There was 
a predominance of lymphocytes (59.18 ± 4.07%). For the HIST group, MI was 
64.03 ± 4.33%, in relation to the NC, with predominance in macrophages number 
(76.53 ± 2.78%). In the CAP group, the MI obtained was 38.90 ± 11.31%, with 
greater macrophage migration occurring (80.98 ± 3.44%) in the higher dose. For 
animals subjected to BK inhalation, the MI was 48.63 ± 3.95% with macrophages 
predominance (64.33 ± 10.04%). In the group that received C48/80 inhalation, the 
MI was 40.25 ± 5.30% (100 mg kg-1), with higher occurrence of macrophages 
(72.97 ± 4.23%).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HECS had a non-specific inhibitory effect 
on cellular migration induced by different pro-inflammatory agents, reducing 
inflammation in airways of mice. These effects coincide and support its 
ethnopharmacological use as an alternative medicine for respiratory diseases in 
regions where the plant is prevalent.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2023.116477

contains at least 18 pharmacologically active components including various 
enzymes, peptides, and amines. This study aimed to evaluate the action of BV on 
some hematological parameters, humoral and cellular immunity, and the 
determination of antioxidant levels in male albino rats. The study included 40 
male albino rats (190-210 g), divided into four groups. Three groups were 
injected subcutaneously with three different doses of BV (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, 
respectively). The control group was injected with saline solution. Blood 
samples were obtained to measure total leucocytes count (TLC), differential 
leukocytes count, hematological parameters (hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), 
red blood cells (RBCs), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean 
cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and Platelets. Sera were used to assess 
immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE), some cytokines e.g., tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), tumor growth factor beta (TGF-β), interleukins 6 and 10 
(IL-6, IL-10), and some antioxidant levels malondialdehyde (MDA), super oxide 
dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH). Data showed that BV therapy increased 
antibody production levels (IgM, IgG, and IgA) while decreasing IgE levels. 
Hematological markers (Hb and lymphocytes) were increased. BV increased total 
TGF- β and IL-10 but decreased total TNF- α and IL-6. On the antioxidant scale, 
an increase in SOD, CAT, and GSH levels was observed, accompanied by a decrease 
in MDA levels. However, the BV treatment led to a significant reduction in the 
number of eosinophils, monocytes, and neutrophils (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our

(TAMs), two immunosuppressive myeloid components within the tumor 
microenvironment (TME), represent fundamental barriers in cancer immunotherapy, 
whereas current nanomedicines rarely exert dual modulatory roles on these cell 
types simultaneously. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) not only mediates 
MDSC-induced immunosuppression but also triggers differentiation and 
polarization of M2-TAMs. Herein, an ROS scavenging nanozyme, Zr-CeO, with 
enhanced superoxide dismutase- and catalase-like activities for renal tumor 
growth inhibition is reported. Mechanistically, intracellular ROS scavenging by 
Zr-CeO significantly attenuates MDSC immunosuppression via dampening the 
unfolded protein response, hinders M2-TAM polarization through the ERK and STAT3 
pathways, but barely affects neoplastic cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. 
Furthermore, Zr-CeO enhances the antitumor effect of PD-1 inhibition in murine 
renal and breast tumor models, accompanied with substantially decreased MDSC 
recruitment and reprogrammed phenotype of TAMs in the tumor mass. Upon cell 
isolation, reversed immunosuppressive phenotypes of MDSCs and TAMs are 
identified. In addition, Zr-CeO alone or combination therapy enhances T 
lymphocyte infiltration and IFN-γ production within the TME. Collectively, a 
promising strategy to impair the quantity and function of immunosuppressive 
myeloid cells and sensitize immunotherapy in both renal and breast cancers is

adjuvants to efficiently induce antiviral immune responses. Specificity and 
potency of these compounds are essential requirements for clinical trial 
applications. In patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, sustained 
loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a therapeutic goal, which may be 
achievable by the sequential activation of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and 
antibody-secreting B cells. We aimed to elucidate whether novel TLR7 agonist, 
GS-986, could activate immune responses involved in HBV elimination.
METHODS: To clarify the impact of GS-986 on pDCs, we quantified the expression 
levels of surface markers and evaluated for Tfh induction in a culture model 
consisting of human pDCs with allogeneic naïve CD4+ T cells. In addition, we 
examined whether GS-986 could enhance HBs antibody production capacity using 
PBMC from CHB patients.
RESULTS: pDCs from CHB patients had lower OX40L expression and as well as 
impaired capacity for Tfh induction compared with those from healthy donors. 
However, GS-986-stimulated pDCs from CHB patients expressed OX40L and produced 
IL-6 and IL-12, resulting in the induction of IL-21-producing Tfh cells (CXCR5+ 
PD-1+ CD4+ ) from naïve CD4+ T cells. The Tfh-inducing capacity of GS-986 was 
reduced in the presence of an anti-OX40L blocking antibody. Furthermore, GS-986 
promoted HBsAg-specific antibody production in PBMCs from CHB patients.
CONCLUSIONS: GS-986 is an adjuvant that stimulates pDCs to induce Tfh 
differentiation and antigen-specific B-cell production. This immune profile may 
be beneficial for therapeutic application as an immune modulator in CHB 
patients.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/liv.15568

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized for the 
skewed Th differentiation towards Th1 and Th17 cells as well as the impaired 
number and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs are capable of 
co-expressing effector Th markers in different inflammatory milieu, which 
probably indicates Treg dysfunction and incompetence to counter over-activated 
immune responses.
METHODS: Ninety-two primary ITP patients from March 2013 to December 2018 were 
included, and proinflammatory plasticity in different Treg compartments, age 
groups, and TGFBR2 variant carrier status were investigated.
RESULTS: Patients were categorized into elderly (n = 44) and younger (n = 48) 
groups according to an age of 50 years at disease onset. The overall remission 
rate was 82.6% after first-line regimens, including 47.8% complete remission. 
TGFBR2 variants were found in 7 (7.6%) patients with three V216I and four T340M 
heterozygote carriers. ITP patients demonstrated elevated co-expression of IL-17 
and decreased co-expression of both IFN-γ and IL-13 than health control (all 
p < 0.01). The elderly group demonstrated elevated prevalence of TGFBR2 variants 
(p = 0.037) and elevated co-expression of IL-17 (p = 0.017) in Tregs, while 
female predominance was found in the younger group (p = 0.037). In the elderly 
group, TGFBR2 variant carriers demonstrated further elevated co-expression of 
IL-17 (p = 0.023) and decreased co-expression of both IFN-γ (p = 0.039) and 
IL-13 (p = 0.046) in the aTreg compartment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed additional aberrations of Treg 
proinflammatory plasticity in elderly primary ITP patients, and highlighted the 
potential role of Treg dysfunction and senescence in the pathogenesis and 
management among these patients.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12865-023-00541-8

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The survival benefit of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization 
(TACE) in patients with hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after 
hepatectomy remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the survival efficacy 
of adjuvant TACE after hepatectomy for HCC.
METHODS: 1491 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy between January 2018 
and September 2021 at four medical centers in China were retrospectively 
analyzed, including 782 patients who received adjuvant TACE and 709 patients who 
did not receive adjuvant TACE. Propensity score matching (PSM) (1:1) was 
performed to minimize selection bias, which balanced the clinical 
characteristics of the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 1254 patients were enrolled after PSM, including 627 
patients who received adjuvant TACE and 627 patients who did not receive 
adjuvant TACE. Patients who received adjuvant TACE had higher disease-free 
survival (DFS, 1- ,2-, and 3-year: 78%-68%-62% vs. 69%-57%-50%, p < 0.001) and 
overall survival (OS, 1- ,2-, and 3-year: 96%-88%-80% vs. 90%-77%-66%, 
p < 0.001) than those who did not receive adjuvant TACE (Median DFS was 39 
months). Among the different levels of risk factors affecting prognosis [AFP, 
Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, Maximum tumor diameter, Number of tumors, 
Child-Pugh classification, Liver cirrhosis, Vascular invasion (imaging), 
Microvascular invasion, Satellite nodules, Differentiation, Chinese liver cancer 
stage II-IIIa], the majority of patients who received adjuvant TACE had higher 
DFS or OS than those who did not receive adjuvant TACE. More patients who 
received adjuvant TACE accepted subsequent antitumor therapy such as liver 
transplantation, re-hepatectomy and local ablation after tumor recurrence, while 
more patients who did not receive adjuvant TACE accepted subsequent antitumor 
therapy with TACE after tumor recurrence (All p < 0.05).

transplantation (LT) is highly morbid and occurs despite strict patient 
selection criteria. Individualized prediction of post-LT HCC recurrence risk 
remains an important need.
METHODS: Clinico-radiologic and pathologic data of 4981 patients with HCC 
undergoing LT from the United States Multicenter HCC Transplant Consortium 
(UMHTC) were analyzed to develop a REcurrent Liver cAncer Prediction ScorE 
(RELAPSE). Multivariable Fine and Gray competing risk analysis and machine 
learning algorithms (MLA; Random Survival Forest [RSF] and Classification and 
Regression Tree (CART) models) identified variables to model HCC recurrence. 
RELAPSE was externally validated in 1160 HCC LT recipients from the European 
Hepatocellular Cancer Liver Transplant (EurHeCaLT) study group.
RESULTS: Of 4981 UMHTC patients with HCC undergoing LT, 71.9% were within Milan 
criteria (MC), 16.1% were initially beyond MC with 9.4% downstaged prior to LT, 
and 12.0% had incidental HCC on explant pathology. Overall and recurrence-free 
survival at 1-, 3-, and 5-years was 89.7%, 78.6%, 69.8% and 86.8%, 74.9%, 66.7%, 
respectively, with a 5-year incidence of HCC recurrence of 12.5% (median 16 mo) 
and non-HCC mortality of 20.8%. A multivariable model identified maximum AFP (HR 
= 1.35 per-log SD, 95%-CI:1.22-1.50, p < 0.001), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (HR 
= 1.16 per-log SD, 95%-CI:1.04-1.28, p < 0.006), pathologic maximum tumor 
diameter (HR = 1.53 per-log SD, 95%-CI 1.35-1.73, p < 0.001), microvascular (HR 
= 2.37, 95%-CI:1.87-2.99, p < 0.001) and macrovascular (HR = 3.38, 
95%-CI:2.41-4.75, p < 0.001) invasion, and tumor differentiation (moderate HR = 
1.75, 95%-CI:1.29-2.37, p < 0.001; poor HR = 2.62, 95%-CI:1.54-3.32, p < 0.001) 
as independent variables predicting post-LT HCC recurrence (C-statistic = 0.78). 
MLAs incorporating additional covariates improved prediction of recurrence (RSF 
C-statistic = 0.81). Despite significant differences in EurHeCaLT recipient 
radiologic, treatment, and pathologic characteristics, external validation of 
RELAPSE demonstrated consistent 2 and 5-year recurrence risk discrimination (AUC 
0.77 and 0.75, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: We develop and externally validate a RELAPSE score which accurately 
discriminates post-LT HCC recurrence risk, and may allow for individualized 
post-LT surveillance, immunosuppression modification, and selection of high-risk 
patients for adjuvant therapies.",Copyright © 2023 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.,"DOI: 10.1097/LVT.0000000000000145

tumor-like proliferation associated with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, 
i.e., M. avium intracellulare, affecting primarily the lymph nodes of 
immunocompromised men in their 5th decade. Involvement of the nasal cavity by 
MSCP is exceedingly rare with only 3 well-documented examples in the literature.
METHODS: A 74-year-old, HIV-negative, man presented with a 0.5-cm nodule of the 
left nasal cavity clinically presenting as a ""nasal polyp."" His medical history 
was significant for colonic adenocarcinoma, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, and 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) transforming to B-cell prolymphocytic 
leukemia, responsive to chemotherapy. The patient was diagnosed with prostatic 
adenocarcinoma treated with radiotherapy two months before the nasal lesion was 
detected. No lymph node enlargement, pulmonary involvement or hepatosplenomegaly 
were noticed. The nasal nodule was surgically excised and histopathologically 
examined to rule out metastatic disease or CLL relapse.
RESULTS: Microscopically, the lesion comprised a well-circumscribed, monotonous, 
spindle cell population in a vaguely storiform arrangement mixed with a heavy 
infiltrate of neutrophils and sparse lymphocytes. The spindle cells featured 
finely granular rich eosinophilic cytoplasm with rounded, oval to epithelioid, 
or elongated nuclei with vesicular chromatin and one or two distinct nucleoli. 
The lesional cells lacked overt cytologic atypia and showed occasional regular 
mitoses. The surface epithelium was intact or focally ulcerated. By 
immunohistochemistry, the spindle cell population stained strongly and diffusely 
for CD68 and was negative for AE1/AE3, SMA, CD34, and PSA. CD3 highlighted 
scattered lymphocytes. Ziehl-Neelsen stain disclosed numerous intracytoplasmic 
acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of MSCP was rendered. No recurrences were 
observed during a 24-month follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Although exceptionally rare, MSCP should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis of nodular lesions of the nasal cavity that are 
characterized microscopically by marked spindle cell proliferation in a vague 
storiform pattern, admixed with a lymphocytic or mixed inflammatory infiltrate. 
A negative medical history for HIV infection and medication-induced 
immunosuppression should not preclude a diagnosis of MSCP, particularly in 
extranodal sites. Once the diagnosis is established, prognosis appears to be 
excellent for nasal MSCP following conservative surgical excision.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

(OVCA). Adoptive T-cell therapies with T-cell receptors (TCRs) targeting 
tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are considered promising solutions for 
less-immunogenic 'cold' ovarian tumors. In order to treat a broader patient 
population, more TCRs targeting peptides derived from different TAAs binding in 
various HLA class I molecules are essential. By performing a differential gene 
expression analysis using mRNA-seq datasets, PRAME, CTCFL and CLDN6 were 
selected as strictly tumor-specific TAAs, with high expression in ovarian cancer 
and at least 20-fold lower expression in all healthy tissues of risk. In primary 
OVCA patient samples and cell lines we confirmed expression and identified 
naturally expressed TAA-derived peptides in the HLA class I ligandome. 
Subsequently, high-avidity T-cell clones recognizing these peptides were 
isolated from the allo-HLA T-cell repertoire of healthy individuals. Three PRAME 
TCRs and one CTCFL TCR of the most promising T-cell clones were sequenced, and 
transferred to CD8+ T cells. The PRAME TCR-T cells demonstrated potent and 
specific antitumor reactivity in vitro and in vivo. The CTCFL TCR-T cells 
efficiently recognized primary patient-derived OVCA cells, and OVCA cell lines 
treated with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC). The identified 
PRAME and CTCFL TCRs are promising candidates for the treatment of patients with 
ovarian cancer, and are an essential addition to the currently used HLA-A*02:01 
restricted PRAME TCRs. Our selection of differentially expressed genes, 
naturally expressed TAA peptides and potent TCRs can improve and broaden the use 
of T-cell therapies for patients with ovarian cancer or other PRAME or CTCFL 
expressing cancers.","Copyright © 2023 van Amerongen, Tuit, Wouters, van de Meent, Siekman, Meeuwsen,

degenerative disease of the central nervous system, affects both males and 
females; however, females suffer from a higher risk of developing MS (2-3:1 
ratio relative to males). The precise sex-based factors influencing risk of MS 
are currently unknown. Here, we explore the role of sex in MS to identify 
molecular mechanisms underlying observed MS sex differences that may guide novel 
therapeutic approaches tailored for males or females.
METHODS: We performed a rigorous and systematic review of genome-wide 
transcriptome studies of MS that included patient sex data in the Gene 
Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress databases following PRISMA statement 
guidelines. For each selected study, we analyzed differential gene expression to 
explore the impact of the disease in females (IDF), in males (IDM) and our main 
goal: the sex differential impact of the disease (SDID). Then, for each scenario 
(IDF, IDM and SDID) we performed 2 meta-analyses in the main tissues involved in 
the disease (brain and blood). Finally, we performed a gene set analysis in 
brain tissue, in which a higher number of genes were dysregulated, to 
characterize sex differences in biological pathways.
RESULTS: After screening 122 publications, the systematic review provided a 
selection of 9 studies (5 in blood and 4 in brain tissue) with a total of 474 
samples (189 females with MS and 109 control females; 82 males with MS and 94 
control males). Blood and brain tissue meta-analyses identified, respectively, 1 
(KIR2DL3) and 13 (ARL17B, CECR7, CEP78, IFFO2, LOC401127, NUDT18, RNF10, 
SLC17A5, STMP1, TRAF3IP2-AS1, UBXN2B, ZNF117, ZNF488) MS-associated genes that 
differed between males and females (SDID comparison). Functional analyses in the 
brain revealed different altered immune patterns in females and males (IDF and 
IDM comparisons). The pro-inflammatory environment and innate immune responses 
related to myeloid lineage appear to be more affected in females, while adaptive 
responses associated with the lymphocyte lineage in males. Additionally, females 
with MS displayed alterations in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, 
purine, and glutamate metabolism, while MS males displayed alterations in stress 
response to metal ion, amine, and amino acid transport.
CONCLUSION: We found transcriptomic and functional differences between MS males 
and MS females (especially in the immune system), which may support the 
development of new sex-based research of this disease. Our study highlights the 
importance of understanding the role of biological sex in MS to guide a more 
personalized medicine.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106113

centrally shape the transcriptional signatures that drive disease evolution and 
that underlie its biological and clinical subsets. Characterizations of 
epigenetic regulators, particularly histone-modifying enzymes, are very 
rudimentary in CLL. In efforts to establish effectors of the CLL-associated 
oncogene T-cell leukemia 1A (TCL1A), we identified here the lysine-specific 
histone demethylase KDM1A to interact with the TCL1A protein in B-cells in 
conjunction with an increased catalytic activity of KDM1A. We demonstrate that 
KDM1A is upregulated in malignant B-cells. Elevated KDM1A and associated gene 
expression signatures correlated with aggressive disease features and adverse 
clinical outcomes in a large prospective CLL trial cohort. Genetic Kdm1a 
knockdown (Kdm1a-KD) in Eμ-TCL1A mice reduced leukemic burden and prolonged 
animal survival, accompanied by upregulated p53 and pro-apoptotic pathways. 
Genetic KDM1A depletion also affected milieu components (T-, stromal, monocytic 
cells), resulting in significant reductions of their capacity to support CLL 
cell survival and proliferation. Integrated analyses of differential global 
transcriptomes (RNA-seq) and H3K4me3 marks (ChIP-seq) in Eµ-TCL1A vs. 
iKdm1aKD;Eµ-TCL1A mice (confirmed in human CLL) implicate KDM1A as an oncogenic 
transcriptional repressor in CLL by altering histone methylation patterns with 
pronounced effects on defined cell death and motility pathways. Finally, 
pharmacologic KDM1A inhibition altered H3K4/9 target methylation and revealed 
marked anti-B-cell-leukemic synergisms. Overall, we established the pathogenic 
role and effector networks of KDM1A in CLL, namely via tumor-cell intrinsic 
mechanisms and impacts in cells of the microenvironment. Our data also provide 
rationales to further investigate therapeutic KDM1A targeting in CLL.",Copyright © 2023 American Society of Hematology.,"DOI: 10.1182/blood.2022017230

myositis and myocarditis after combined immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) 
therapy (anti-programmed cell death receptor-1, anti-lymphocyte activating

typical time window after ICI, recurrence upon re-challenge, elevations of CK, 
high-sensitive troponin T (hs-TnT) and I (hs-TnI), mild NT-proBNP increase, and

development in the thymus. Increased DNA replication can result in increased DNA 
mutations in the nuclear genome, but also in mitochondrial genomes. A high 
frequency of mitochondrial DNA mutations can lead to abnormal mitochondrial 
function and have negative implications on human health. Furthermore, aging is 
accompanied by an increase in such mutations through oxidative damage and 
replication errors. Increased mitochondrial DNA mutations cause loss of 
mitochondrial protein function, and decrease energy production, substrates, and 
metabolites. Here we have evaluated the effect of increased mitochondrial DNA 
mutations on T cell development in the thymus. Using mice carrying a mutant 
mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (PolG) that causes increased mitochondrial DNA 
mutations, we show that high fidelity replication of mitochondrial DNA is 
pivotal for proper T cell development. Reducing the fidelity of mitochondrial 
DNA replication results in a premature age-dependent reduction in the total 
number of CD4/CD8 double negative and double positive thymocytes. Analysis of 
mitochondrial density in thymocyte subpopulations suggests that this may be due 
to reduced proliferation in specific double negative stages. Taken together, 
this work suggests that T cell development is regulated by the ability of 
mitochondria to faithfully replicate their DNA.","Copyright © 2023 Limper, Bondah, Zhu, Villanueva, Chukwukere, Huang and August.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1128626

potential curative therapy against hematological malignancies, modulation of 
donor T cell alloreactivity is required to enhance the graft-versus-leukemia 
(GVL) effect and control graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after allo-HSCT. 
Donor-derived regulatory CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (Tregs) play a central role in 
establishing of immune tolerance after allo-HSCT. They could be a key target to 
be modulated for increasing the GVL effect and control of GVHD. We constructed 
an ordinary differential equation model incorporating bidirectional interactions 
between Tregs and effector CD4+ T cells (Teffs) as a mechanism for control of 
Treg cell concentration. The goal is to elucidate how the interaction between 
Tregs and Teffs is modulated in order to get insights into fine tuning of 
alloreactivity after allo-HSCT. The model was calibrated with respect to 
published Treg and Teff recovery data after allo-HSCT. The calibrated model 
exhibits perfect or near-perfect adaptation to stepwise perturbations between 
Treg and Teff interactions, as seen in Treg cell populations when patients with 
relapsed malignancy were treated with anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4). In addition, the model predicts observed 
shifts of Tregs and Teffs concentrations after co-stimulatory receptor IL-2R or 
TNFR2 blockade with allo-HSCT. The present results suggest simultaneous 
blockades of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors as a potential treatment

Foxp3+ Treg cells in the TME of cholangiocarcinoma through the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling 
pathway. High-throughput sequencing dataset in the GEO database combined with

among MUC1, EGFR, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was explored. CD4+ T cells 
extracted from peripheral blood were induced to differentiate into Treg cells, 
followed by co-culture with cholangiocarcinoma cells. A mouse model was 
constructed to detect the role of MUC1 in the accumulation of Foxp3+ Treg cells,

as they respond to external cues and differentiate into T helper (Th) cells. T 
cells exhibit plasticity between Th phenotypes in highly inflammatory 
environments, such as colitis, in which high levels of IL-6 promote plasticity 
between regulatory T (Treg) cells and Th17 cells. Protein Kinase C theta (PKCθ) 
is a T cell-specific serine/threonine kinase that promotes Th17 differentiation 
while negatively regulating Treg differentiation. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), also a 
serine/threonine kinase and encoded by Stk11, is necessary for Treg survival and 
function. Stk11 can be alternatively spliced to produce a short variant (Stk11S) 
by transcribing a cryptic exon. However, the contribution of Stk11 splice 
variants to Th cell differentiation has not been previously explored. Here we 
show that in Th17 cells, the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein, hnRNPLL, mediates 
Stk11 splicing into its short splice variant, and that Stk11S expression is 
diminished when Hnrnpll is depleted using siRNA knock-down approaches. We 
further show that PKCθ regulates hnRNPLL and, thus, Stk11S expression in Th17 
cells. We provide additional evidence that exposing induced (i)Tregs to IL-6 
culminates in Stk11 splicing downstream of PKCθAltogether our data reveal a yet 
undescribed outside-in signaling pathway initiated by IL-6, that acts through 
PKCθ and hnRNPLL to regulate Stk11 splice variants and facilitate Th17 cell 
differentiation. Furthermore, we show for the first time, that this pathway can 
also be initiated in developing iTregs exposed to IL-6, providing mechanistic 
insight into iTreg phenotypic stability and iTreg to Th17 cell plasticity.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.molimm.2023.03.020

pre-treatment inflammatory markers and other clinical characteristics and the 
survival of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients who received first-line 
platinum-based treatment and to construct nomograms for predicting overall 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).
METHODS: A total of 612 patients diagnosed with SCLC between March 2008 and 
August 2021 were randomly divided into two cohorts: a training cohort (n = 459) 
and a validation cohort (n = 153). Inflammatory markers, clinicopathological 
factors, and follow-up information of patients were collected for each case. Cox 
regression was used to conduct univariate and multivariate analyses and the 
independent prognostic factors were adopted to develop the nomograms. Harrell's 
concordance index (C-index) and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic 
curve were used to verify model differentiation, calibration curve was used to 
verify consistency, and decision curve analysis was used to verify the clinical 
application value.
RESULTS: Our results showed that baseline C-reactive protein/albumin ratio, 
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, NSE level, hyponatremia, the efficacy of first-line 
chemotherapy, and stage were independent prognostic factors for both OS and PFS 
in SCLC. In the training cohort, the C-index of PFS and OS was 0.698 and 0.666, 
respectively. In the validation cohort, the C-index of PFS and OS was 0.727 and 
0.747, respectively. The nomograms showed good predictability and high clinical 
value. Also, our new clinical models were superior to the US Veterans 
Administration Lung Study Group (VALG) staging for predicting the prognosis of 
SCLC.

due to their minimally invasive harvest, high yield, and immunomodulatory 
capacity. In this study, we investigated the effects of local vs. systemic ASC 
delivery on VCA survival and alloimmune regulation.
METHODS: Lewis rats received hindlimb transplants from Brown Norway rats and 
were administered donor-derived ASCs (passage 3-4, 1x10 6 cells/rat) locally in 
the allograft, or contralateral limb, or systemically at postoperative day (POD) 
1. Recipients were treated intraperitoneal with rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum 
on POD -4 and 1, and daily tacrolimus for 21 days. Limb allografts were 
monitored for clinical signs of rejection. Donor cell chimerism, immune cell 
differentiation, and cytokine expression in recipient lymphoid organs were 
measured by flow cytometric analysis. The immunomodulation function of ASCs was 
tested by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay and ASC stimulation studies.
RESULTS: Local-ASC treated recipients achieved significant prolonged allograft 
survival (85.7% survived >130 days, n=6) compared to systemic- and 
contralateral-ASC groups. Secondary donor skin allografts transplanted to the 
local-ASC long-term surviving recipients accepted permanently without additional 
immunosuppression. The increases in donor cell chimerism and regulatory T-cells 
were evident in blood and draining lymph nodes of the local-ASC group. Moreover, 
MLR showed that ASCs inhibited donor-specific T cell proliferation independently 
of direct ASC-T-cell contact. ASCs upregulated anti-inflammatory molecules in 
response to cytokines stimulation in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Local delivery of ASCs promoted long-term survival and modulated 
alloimmune responses in a full MHC-mismatched VCA model and was more effective 
than systemic administration.",Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.,"DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010510

radiation exposure (DEARE), a chronic condition affecting multiple organs, 
including lung, kidney, heart, gastrointestinal tract, eyes, and brain, and 
often causing cancer. While effective medical countermeasures (MCM) for the 
hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) have been identified and approved 
by the FDA, development of MCM for DEARE has not yet been successful. We 
previously documented residual bone marrow damage (RBMD) and progressive renal 
and cardiovascular DEARE in murine survivors of H-ARS, and significant survival 
efficacy of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) given as a radioprotectant 
or radiomitigator for H-ARS. We now describe additional DEARE (physiological and 
neural function, progressive fur graying, ocular inflammation, and malignancy) 
developing after sub-threshold doses in our H-ARS model, and detailed analysis 
of the effects of dmPGE2 administered before (PGE-pre) or after (PGE-post) 
lethal total-body irradiation (TBI) on these DEARE. Administration of PGE-pre 
normalized the twofold reduction of white blood cells (WBC) and lymphocytes seen 
in vehicle-treated survivors (Veh), and increased the number of bone marrow (BM) 
cells, splenocytes, thymocytes, and phenotypically defined hematopoietic 
progenitor cells (HPC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to levels equivalent 
to those in non-irradiated age-matched controls. PGE-pre significantly protected 
HPC colony formation ex vivo by >twofold, long term-HSC in vivo engraftment 
potential up to ninefold, and significantly blunted TBI-induced myeloid skewing. 
Secondary transplantation documented continued production of LT-HSC with normal 
lineage differentiation. PGE-pre reduced development of DEARE cardiovascular 
pathologies and renal damage; prevented coronary artery rarefication, blunted 
progressive loss of coronary artery endothelia, reduced inflammation and 
coronary early senescence, and blunted radiation-induced increase in blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN). Ocular monocytes were significantly lower in PGE-pre mice, as 
was TBI-induced fur graying. Increased body weight and decreased frailty in male 
mice, and reduced incidence of thymic lymphoma were documented in PGE-pre mice. 
In assays measuring behavioral and cognitive functions, PGE-pre reduced anxiety 
in females, significantly blunted shock flinch response, and increased 
exploratory behavior in males. No effect of TBI was observed on memory in any 
group. PGE-post, despite significantly increasing 30-day survival in H-ARS and 
WBC and hematopoietic recovery, was not effective in reducing TBI-induced RBMD 
or any other DEARE. In summary, dmPGE2 administered as an H-ARS MCM before 
lethal TBI significantly increased 30-day survival and ameliorated RBMD and 
multi-organ and cognitive/behavioral DEARE to at least 12 months after TBI, 
whereas given after TBI, dmPGE2 enhances survival from H-ARS but has little 
impact on RBMD or other DEARE.",© 2023 by Radiation Research Society.,"DOI: 10.1667/RADE-22-00208.1

Samples were irradiated with 1.42 Gy 2.5-MeV neutrons, 0.71 Gy neutrons and 0.71 
Gy 137Cs γ rays, and 1.42 Gy 137Cs γ rays. Transcriptome sequencing identified 
56 differentially co-expressed genes and enriched 26 KEGG pathways. There are 
97, 45 and 30 differentially expressed genes in neutron, neutron and γ ray 
combined treatment, and γ rays, respectively, and 21, 3 and 8 KEGG pathways with 
significant differences are enriched. Fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain

MDM2. Additionally, irradiation of AHH-1 human lymphocytes with a 252Cf neutron 
source at 0, 0.14, 0.35, and 0.71 Gy, fluorescence qPCR revealed a dose-response

0.803, 0.999, and 0.999, respectively. Thus, neutrons can induce more 
differentially expressed genes and enrich more pathways. Combined treatment of 
neutrons and γ-rays may incorporate damage of both high and low LET, the genes

elements and a substantial part of the human genome. Their role in development 
has been well documented and there is now mounting evidence that dysregulated 
HERV expression also contributes to various human diseases. While research on 
HERV elements has in the past been hampered by their high sequence similarity, 
advanced sequencing technology and analytical tools have empowered the field. 
For the first time, we are now able to undertake locus-specific HERV analysis, 
deciphering expression patterns, regulatory networks and biological functions of 
these elements. To do so, we inevitable rely on omics datasets available through 
the public domain. However, technical parameters inevitably differ, making 
inter-study analysis challenging. We here address the issue of confounding 
factors for profiling locus-specific HERV transcriptomes using datasets from 
multiple sources.
METHODS: We collected RNAseq datasets of CD4 and CD8 primary T cells and 
extracted HERV expression profiles for 3220 elements, resembling most intact, 
near full-length proviruses. Looking at sequencing parameters and batch effects, 
we compared HERV signatures across datasets and determined permissive features 
for HERV expression analysis from multiple-source data.
RESULTS: We could demonstrate that considering sequencing parameters, 
sequencing-depth is most influential on HERV signature outcome. Sequencing 
samples deeper broadens the spectrum of expressed HERV elements. Sequencing mode 
and read length are secondary parameters. Nevertheless, we find that HERV 
signatures from smaller RNAseq datasets do reliably reveal most abundantly 
expressed HERV elements. Overall, HERV signatures between samples and studies 
overlap substantially, indicating a robust HERV transcript signature in CD4 and 
CD8 T cells. Moreover, we find that measures of batch effect reduction are 
critical to uncover genic and HERV expression differences between cell types. 
After doing so, differences in the HERV transcriptome between ontologically 
closely related CD4 and CD8 T cells became apparent.
CONCLUSION: In our systematic approach to determine sequencing and analysis 
parameters for detection of locus-specific HERV expression, we provide evidence 
that analysis of RNAseq datasets from multiple studies can aid confidence of 
biological findings. When generating de novo HERV expression datasets we 
recommend increased sequence depth ( > = 100 mio reads) compared to standard 
genic transcriptome pipelines. Finally, batch effect reduction measures need to 
be implemented to allow for differential expression analysis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12920-023-01486-y

which excessive CD4+ T-cell activation and imbalanced effector T-cell 
differentiation play critical roles. Recent studies have implied a potential 
association between posttranscriptional N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification 
and CD4+ T-cell-mediated humoral immunity. However, how this biological process 
contributes to lupus is not well understood. In this work, we investigated the 
role of the m6A methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) in CD4+ T-cell activation, 
differentiation, and SLE pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: The expression of METTL3 was knocked down and METTL3 enzyme activity 
was inhibited using siRNA and catalytic inhibitor, respectively. In vivo 
evaluation of METTL3 inhibition on CD4+ T-cell activation, effector T-cell 
differentiation, and SLE pathogenesis was achieved using a sheep red blood cell 
(SRBC)-immunized mouse model and a chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) 
mouse model. RNA-seq was performed to identify pathways and gene signatures 
targeted by METTL3. m6A RNA-immunoprecipitation qPCR was applied to confirm the 
m6A modification of METTL3 targets.
RESULTS: METTL3 was defective in the CD4+ T cells of SLE patients. METTL3 
expression varied following CD4+ T-cell activation and effector T-cell 
differentiation in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition of METTL3 promoted the 
activation of CD4+ T cells and influenced the differentiation of effector T 
cells, predominantly Treg cells, in vivo. Moreover, METTL3 inhibition increased 
antibody production and aggravated the lupus-like phenotype in cGVHD mice. 
Further investigation revealed that catalytic inhibition of METTL3 reduced Foxp3 
expression by enhancing Foxp3 mRNA decay in a m6A-dependent manner, hence 
suppressing Treg cell differentiation.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our findings demonstrated that METTL3 was required for 
stabilizing Foxp3 mRNA via m6A modification to maintain the Treg differentiation 
program. METTL3 inhibition contributed to the pathogenesis of SLE by 
participating in the activation of CD4+ T cells and imbalance of effector T-cell 
differentiation, which could serve as a potential target for therapeutic 
intervention in SLE.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s10020-023-00643-4

to the destruction of exocrine glands and multisystem lesions. Abnormal 
proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation of CD4+ T cells are key factors in 
the pathogenesis of pSS. Autophagy is one of the important mechanisms to 
maintain immune homeostasis and function of CD4+ T cells. Human umbilical cord 
mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (UCMSC-Exos) may simulate the 
immunoregulation of MSCs while avoiding the risks of MSCs treatment. However, 
whether UCMSC-Exos can regulate the functions of CD4+ T cells in pSS, and 
whether the effects via the autophagy pathway remains unclear.
METHODS: The study analyzed retrospectively the peripheral blood lymphocyte 
subsets in pSS patients, and explored the relationship between lymphocyte 
subsets and disease activity. Next, peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were sorted 
using immunomagnetic beads. The proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and 
inflammatory factors of CD4+ T cells were determined using flow cytometry. 
Autophagosomes of CD4+ T cells were detected using transmission electron 
microscopy, autophagy-related proteins and genes were detected using western 
blotting or RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: The study demonstrated that the peripheral blood CD4+ T cells decreased 
in pSS patients, and negatively correlated with disease activity. UCMSC-Exos 
inhibited excessive proliferation and apoptosis of CD4+ T cells in pSS patients, 
blocked them in the G0/G1 phase, inhibited them from entering the S phase, 
reduced the Th17 cell ratio, elevated the Treg ratio, inhibited IFN-γ, TNF-α, 
IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-17F secretion, and promoted IL-10 and TGF-β secretion. 
UCMSC-Exos reduced the elevated autophagy levels in the peripheral blood CD4+ T 
cells of patients with pSS. Furthermore, UCMSC-Exos regulated CD4+ T cell 
proliferation and early apoptosis, inhibited Th17 cell differentiation, promoted 
Treg cell differentiation, and restored the Th17/Treg balance in pSS patients 
through the autophagy pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that UCMSC-Exos exerts an immunomodulatory 
effect on the CD4+ T cells, and maybe as a new treatment for pSS.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10787-023-01189-x

(#)Contributed equally","Lack of reliable predictive biomarkers is a major limitation of combination 
therapy with chemotherapy and anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed 
death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) therapy (chemo-immunotherapy). We previously 
observed that the increase of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells expressing CX3CR1, a 
marker of differentiation, correlates with response to anti-PD-1 therapy; 
however, the predictive and prognostic value of T-cell CX3CR1 expression during 
chemo-immunotherapy is unknown. Here, we evaluated the utility of circulating 
CX3CR1+CD8+ T cells as a predictive correlate of response to chemo-immunotherapy 
in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). At least 10% increase of 
the CX3CR1+ subset in circulating CD8+ T cells from baseline (CX3CR1 score) was 
associated with response to chemo-immunotherapy as early as 4 weeks with 85.7% 
overall accuracy of predicting response at 6 weeks. Furthermore, at least 10% 
increase of the CX3CR1 score correlated with substantially better 
progression-free (P = 0.0051) and overall survival (P = 0.0138) on Kaplan-Meier 
analysis. Combined single-cell RNA/T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of 
circulating T cells from longitudinally obtained blood samples and TCR 
sequencing of tumor tissue from the same patient who received a long-term 
benefit from the treatment demonstrated remarkable changes in genomic and 
transcriptomic signatures of T cells as well as evolution of TCR clonotypes in 
peripheral blood containing highly frequent tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte 
repertoires overexpressing CX3CR1 early after initiation of the treatment 
despite stable findings of the imaging study. Collectively, these findings 
highlight the potential utility of T-cell CX3CR1 expression as a dynamic 
blood-based biomarker during the early course of chemo-immunotherapy and a 
marker to identify frequent circulating tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte 
repertoires.
SIGNIFICANCE: Current approaches to combined chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
therapy (chemo-immunotherapy) for patients with NSCLC are limited by the lack of 
reliable predictive biomarkers. This study shows the utility of T-cell 
differentiation marker, CX3CR1, as an early on-treatment predictor of response 
and changes in genomic/transcriptomic signatures of circulating 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte repertoires in patients with NSCLC undergoing 
chemo-immunotherapy.",© 2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-22-0383

leading to degeneration of joints, chronic pain, and disability in the elderly. 
Little is known about the role of immune-related genes (IRGs) and immune cells

METHOD: Hub IRGs of OA were identified by differential expression analysis and 
filtered by three machine learning strategies, including random forest (RF), 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and support vector 
machine (SVM). A diagnostic nomogram model was then constructed by using these 
hub IRGs, with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision curve 
analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) estimating its 
performance and clinical impact. Hierarchical clustering analysis was then 
conducted by setting the hub IRGs as input information. Differences in immune 
cell infiltration and activities of immune pathways were revealed between 
different immune subtypes.
RESULT: Five hub IRGs of OA were identified, including TNFSF11, SCD1, PGF, 
EDNRB, and IL1R1. Of them, TNFSF11 and SCD1 contributed the most to the 
diagnostic nomogram model with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.904 and 
0.864, respectively. Two immune subtypes were characterized. The immune 
over-activated subtype showed excessively activated cellular immunity with a 
higher proportion of activated B cells and activated CD8 T cells. The two 
phenotypes were also seen in two validation cohorts.

inflammatory biomarkers, the relationship between neutrophil counts and NLR and 
SHR were poorly explored in IS. We aimed to systemically and comprehensively 
explore the correlation between various blood inflammation markers (mainly 
neutrophil counts and NLR) and SHR.
METHODS: Data from 487 patients with acute IS(AIS) in Xiangya Hospital were

(≤1.02 versus >1.02). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate 
the correlation between neutrophil counts and NLR and high SHR group. Subgroup 
analyses were performed in the TOAST classification and functional prognosis.
RESULTS: The neutrophil counts and NLR were all clearly associated with SHR 
levels in different logistic analysis models. In the subgroup analysis of TOAST 
classification, the higher neutrophil counts and NLR were the independent risk 
factors for high SHR patients with large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA)

independent risk factor for high SHR patients with cardioembolism (CE) (adjusted 
OR:2.413, 95% CI: 1.081-5.383, P=0.031). ROC analysis showed that neutrophil 
counts was helpful for differentiating high SHR group with CE and low SHR group 
with CE (neutrophil: AUC =0.776, P=0.002). However, there were no difference in 
levels of neutrophil counts and NLR between patients with SVO and without SVO. 
The higher neutrophil counts and NLR independently associated with high SHR

américain adulte présentant des signes neurologiques centraux. L’analyse 
pré-mortem du liquide céphalo-rachidien a révélé une pléocytose mononucléaire, 
principalement lymphocytaire, qui est une trouvaille rapportée chez d’autres 
espèces atteintes de listériose. Les modifications histopathologiques 
post-mortem du tronc cérébral étaient caractéristiques de la listériose et 
l’infection a été confirmée par un marquage immunohistochimique et une culture 
bactérienne.Message clinique clé :La listériose doit être incluse comme

have renewed interest in cortisol in that it may also have important roles in 
the stress response. The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that 
chronic treatment with low levels of either corticosterone or cortisol would 
alter HLR and immune organ morphometrics. Further, we wanted to determine if 
chronic treatment with either GC would elicit an increase in cortisol levels in 
egg albumen. To test our hypotheses, we implanted silastic capsules that 
contained corticosterone, cortisol, or empty capsules as controls (N = 
5/sex/treatment). Blood serum, smears, body weights, and egg quality data were 
collected. Ducks were then euthanized and body weight, weights of spleens, 
livers, and the number of active follicles were recorded. Albumen GC levels were 
assessed using mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using a 2- or 3-way ANOVA 
as appropriate and post-hoc with Fishers PLSD. No treatment elicited differences 
in egg quality measures or body weight compared to controls. Corticosterone 
treatment did elicit an increase in serum corticosterone (p < 0.05), but not 
cortisol, levels compared to controls in both sexes. Both cortisol and 
corticosterone treatments increased (p < 0.05) serum levels of cortisol compared 
to controls. Relative spleen weights were higher (p < 0.05) in hens following 
corticosterone but not cortisol treatment. No other organs showed any 
differences among the treatment groups. Both GCs elicited an increase (p < 
0.001) in HLR in hens at all time-points over the 2-week treatment period 
compared to controls. Cortisol, not corticosterone, only elicited an increase in 
HLR for drakes (p < 0.05) compared to controls but only at day 1 after implants. 
Chronic treatment with cortisol, but not corticosterone, elicited an increase (p 
< 0.01) in egg albumen cortisol levels compared to other groups. Corticosterone 
was not detected in any albumen samples. Our results suggest that 
glucocorticoids elicit differential effects and although corticosterone has been 
stated to be the predominant GC in avian species, cortisol may provide critical 
information to further understand bird welfare.","Copyright © 2023 Oluwagbenga, Tetel, Tonissen, Karcher and Fraley.","DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2023.1132728

(CLL) are often unique, expressing remarkably similar IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene 
rearrangements, ""stereotyped BCRs"". The B-cell receptors (BCRs) on CLL cells are 
also distinctive in often deriving from autoreactive B lymphocytes, leading to 
the assumption of a defect in immune tolerance.
RESULTS: Using bulk and single-cell immunoglobulin heavy and light chain 
variable domain sequencing, we enumerated CLL stereotype-like IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ 
sequences (CLL-SLS) in B cells from cord blood (CB) and adult peripheral blood 
(PBMC) and bone marrow (BM of healthy donors. CLL-SLS were found at similar 
frequencies among CB, BM, and PBMC, suggesting that age does not influence 
CLL-SLS levels. Moreover, the frequencies of CLL-SLS did not differ among B 
lymphocytes in the BM at early stages of development, and only re-circulating 
marginal zone B cells contained significantly higher CLL-SLS frequencies than 
other mature B-cell subpopulations. Although we identified CLL-SLS corresponding 
to most of the CLL major stereotyped subsets, CLL-SLS frequencies did not 
correlate with those found in patients. Interestingly, in CB samples, half of 
the CLL-SLS identified were attributed to two IGHV-mutated subsets. We also 
found satellite CLL-SLS among the same normal samples, and they were also 
enriched in naïve B cells but unexpectedly, these were ~10-fold higher than 
standard CLL-SLS. In general, IGHV-mutated CLL-SLS subsets were enriched among 
antigen-experienced B-cell subpopulations, and IGHV-unmutated CLL-SLS were found 
mostly in antigen-inexperienced B cells. Nevertheless, CLL-SLS with an 
IGHV-mutation status matching that of CLL clones varied among the normal B-cell 
subpopulations, suggesting that specific CLL-SLS could originate from distinct 
subpopulations of normal B cells. Lastly, using single-cell DNA sequencing, we 
identified paired IGH and IGL rearrangements in normal B lymphocytes resembling 
those of stereotyped BCRs in CLL, although some differed from those in patients 
based on IG isotype or somatic mutation.
DISCUSSION: CLL-SLS are present in normal B-lymphocyte populations at all stages 
of development. Thus, despite their autoreactive profile they are not deleted by 
central tolerance mechanisms, possibly because the level of autoreactivity is 
not registered as dangerous by deletion mechanisms or because editing of L-chain 
variable genes occurred which our experimental approach could not identify.","Copyright © 2023 Vergani, Bagnara, Agathangelidis, Ng, Ferrer, Mazzarello,

The purpose of this study is to construct a scoring system grounded on 
peripheral blood parameters associated with nutrition and inflammation and 
explore its value in stage, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival 
(PFS) prediction for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred and fifty-three EOC patients were 
retrospectively identified and their clinical data and relevant peripheral blood 
parameters were collected. The ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte, lymphocyte to 
monocyte, fibrinogen to lymphocyte, total cholesterol to lymphocyte and albumin 
level were calculated and dichotomized. A scoring system named peripheral blood 
score (PBS) was constructed. Univariate and multivariate Logistic or Cox 
regression analyses were used to select independent factors; these factors were 
then used to develop nomogram models of advanced stage and OS, PFS, 
respectively. The internal validation and DCA analysis were performed to 
evaluate models.
RESULTS: Lower PBS indicated a better prognosis and higher PBS indicated 
inferior. High PBS is associated with advanced stage, high CA125, serous 
histological type, poor differentiation, and accompanied ascites. The logistic 
regression showed age, CA125, and PBS were independent factors for the FIGO 
III-IV stage. The nomogram models for advanced FIGO stage based on these factors 
showed good efficiency. FIGO stage, residual disease, and PBS were independent 
factors affecting OS and PFS, the nomogram models composed of these factors had 
good performance. DCA curves revealed the models augmented net benefits.
CONCLUSION: PBS can be a noninvasive biomarker for EOC patients' prognosis. The 
related nomogram models could be powerful, cost-effective tools to provide 
information of advanced stage, OS, and PFS for EOC patients.",© 2023 Bai et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/JIR.S401451

Systematical identification of clinically relevant metabolic subtypes of 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is critical to understand tumor heterogeneity and 
develop efficient treatment strategies.
METHODS: We performed an integrative analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and 
clinical data from an HCC patient cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
RESULTS: Four metabolic subtypes were defined: mHCC1, mHHC2, mHCC3, and mHCC4. 
These subtypes had distinct differences in mutations profiles, activities of 
metabolic pathways, prognostic metabolism genes, and immune features. The mHCC1 
was associated with poorest outcome and was characterized by extensive metabolic 
alterations, abundant immune infiltration, and increased expression of 
immunosuppressive checkpoints. The mHHC2 displayed lowest metabolic alteration 
level and was associated with most significant improvement in overall survival 
in response to high CD8+ T cell infiltration. The mHHC3 was a ""cold-tumor"" with 
low immune infiltration and few metabolic alterations. The mHCC4 presented a 
medium degree of metabolic alteration and high CTNNB1 mutation rate. Based on 
our HCC classification and in vitro study, we identified palmitoyl-protein 
thioesterase 1 (PPT1) was a specific prognostic gene and therapeutic target for 
mHCC1.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted mechanistic differences among metabolic 
subtypes and identified potential therapeutic targets for subtype-specific 
treatment strategies targeting unique metabolic vulnerabilities. The immune 
heterogeneities across metabolic subtypes may help further clarify the 
association between metabolism and immune environment and guide the development 
of novel strategies through targeting both unique metabolic vulnerabilities and 
immunosuppressive triggers.","Copyright © 2023 Yang, Zeng, Chen, Zheng, Zhou and Chen.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1076587

score, especially the IFN-I score, in patients with anti-melanoma 
differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibody-positive dermatomyositis 
(anti-MDA5+ DM).
METHODS: We enrolled 262 patients with different autoimmune diseases, including 
idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid 
arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, and Sjögren's syndrome, as well as 58 
healthy controls. Multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR) using four TaqMan probes was used to evaluate type I IFN-stimulated 
genes (IFI44 and MX1), one type II IFN-stimulated gene (IRF1), and one internal 
control gene (HRPT1), which were used to determine the IFN-I score. The clinical 
features and disease activity index were compared between the high and low IFN-I 
score groups in 61 patients with anti-MDA5+ DM. The associations between 
laboratory findings and the predictive value of the baseline IFN-I score for 
mortality were analyzed.
RESULTS: The IFN score was significantly higher in patients with anti-MDA5+ DM 
than in healthy controls. The IFN-I score was positively correlated with the 
serum IFN-α concentration, ferritin concentration, and Myositis Disease Activity 
Assessment Visual Analogue Scale (MYOACT) score. Compared with patients with a 
low IFN-I score, patients with a high IFN-I score showed a higher MYOACT score, 
C-reactive protein concentration, aspartate transaminase concentration, ferritin 
concentration, plasma cell percentage, and CD3+ T-cell percentage, as well as 
lower lymphocyte, natural killer cell, and monocyte counts. The 3-month survival 
rate was significantly lower in patients with an IFN-I score of >4.9 than in 
those with an IFN-I score of ≤4.9 (72.9% vs. 100%, respectively; P = 0.044).
CONCLUSION: The IFN score, especially the IFN-I score, measured by multiplex 
RT-qPCR is a valuable tool to monitor disease activity and predict mortality in

cells that respond to conserved pathogen-derived vitamin B metabolites presented 
by the MHC class I related-1 molecule (MR1) antigen presentation pathway. Whilst 
viruses do not synthesize these metabolites, we have reported that varicella 
zoster virus (VZV) profoundly suppresses MR1 expression, implicating this virus 
in manipulation of the MR1:MAIT cell axis. During primary infection, the 
lymphotropism of VZV is likely to be instrumental in hematogenous dissemination 
of virus to gain access to cutaneous sites where it clinically manifests as 
varicella (chickenpox). However, MAIT cells, which are found in the blood and at 
mucosal and other organ sites, have yet to be examined in the context of VZV 
infection. The goal of this study was to examine any direct impact of VZV on 
MAIT cells.
METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we interrogated whether primary blood derived 
MAIT cells are permissive to infection by VZV whilst further analysing 
differential levels of infection between various MAIT cell subpopulations. 
Changes in cell surface extravasation, skin homing, activation and proliferation 
markers after VZV infection of MAIT cells was also assessed via flow cytometry. 
Finally the capacity of MAIT cells to transfer infectious virus was tested 
through an infectious center assay and imaged via fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: We identify primary blood-derived MAIT cells as being permissive to VZV 
infection. A consequence of VZV infection of MAIT cells was their capacity to 
transfer infectious virus to other permissive cells, consistent with MAIT cells 
supporting productive infection. When subgrouping MAIT cells by their co- 
expression of a variety cell surface markers, there was a higher proportion of 
VZV infected MAIT cells co-expressing CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ MAIT cells compared to 
the more phenotypically dominant CD8+ MAIT cells, whereas infection was not 
associated with differences in co-expression of CD56 (MAIT cell subset with 
enhanced responsiveness to innate cytokine stimulation), CD27 (co-stimulatory) 
or PD-1 (immune checkpoint). Infected MAIT cells retained high expression of 
CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, CLA and CCR4, indicating a potentially intact capacity for 
transendothelial migration, extravasation and trafficking to skin sites. 
Infected MAIT cells also displayed increased expression of CD69 (early 
activation) and CD71 (proliferation) markers.
DISCUSSION: These data identify MAIT cells as being permissive to VZV infection 
and identify impacts of such infection on co- expressed functional markers.","Copyright © 2023 Purohit, Corbett, Slobedman and Abendroth.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1121714

disease mainly mediated by IgG autoantibody. While follicular helper T (Tfh) 
cells are crucial for supporting IgG autoantibody generation in human SLE, 
underlying mechanisms for Tfh cell mal-differentiation remain unclear.
METHODS: In total, 129 SLE patients and 37 healthy donors were recruited for 
this study. Circulating leptin was determined by ELISA from patients with SLE 
and healthy individuals. CD4 T cells isolated from SLE patients and healthy 
donors were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads under cytokine-unbiased 
conditions in the presence or absence of recombinant leptin protein, followed by 
detection for Tfh cell differentiation by quantifying intracellular 
transcription factor Bcl-6 and cytokine IL-21. AMPK activation was assessed by 
analyzing phosphor-AMPK using phosflow cytometry and immunoblots. Leptin 
receptor expression was determined using flow cytometry and its overexpression 
was achieved by transfection with an expression vector. Humanized SLE chimeras 
were induced by injecting patients' immune cells into immune-deficient NSG mice 
and used for translational studies.
RESULTS: Circulating leptin was elevated in patients with SLE, inversely 
associated with disease activity. In healthy individuals, leptin efficiently 
inhibited Tfh cell differentiation through inducing AMPK activation. Meanwhile, 
leptin receptor deficiency was a feature of CD4 T cells in SLE patients, 
impairing the inhibitory effect of leptin on the differentiation of Tfh cells. 
As a result, we observed the coexistence of high circulating leptin and 
increased Tfh cell frequencies in SLE patients. Accordingly, overexpression of 
leptin receptor in SLE CD4 T cells abrogated Tfh cell mal-differentiation and 
IgG anti-dsDNA generation in humanized lupus chimeras.
CONCLUSION: Leptin receptor deficiency blocks the inhibitory effect of leptin on 
SLE Tfh cell differentiation, serving as a promising therapeutic target for 
lupus management.","Copyright © 2023 Liu, Zheng, Jia, Wang, Tang, Wen, Zhang and Yuan.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1157731

monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) is a hallmark of 
immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. There is an urgent need for the 
development of novel drugs with the capacity to impair innate immune cell 
overactivation under inflammatory conditions. Compelling evidence pointed out 
cannabinoids as potential therapeutic tools with anti-inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory capacity. WIN55,212-2, a non-selective synthetic cannabinoid 
agonist, displays protective effects in several inflammatory conditions by 
mechanisms partially depending on the generation of tolerogenic DCs able to 
induce functional regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, its immunomodulatory 
capacity on other myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages remains 
incompletely understood.
METHODS: Human monocyte-derived DCs (hmoDCs) were differentiated in the absence 
(conventional hmoDCs) or presence of WIN55,212-2 (WIN-hmoDCs). Cells were 
stimulated with LPS, cocultured with naive T lymphocytes and their cytokine 
production and ability to induce T cell responses were analysed by ELISA or flow 
cytometry. To evaluate the effect of WIN55,212-2 in macrophage polarization, 
human and murine macrophages were activated with LPS or LPS/IFNγ, in the 
presence or absence of the cannabinoid. Cytokine, costimulatory molecules and 
inflammasome markers were assayed. Metabolic and chromatin immunoprecipitation 
assays were also performed. Finally, the protective capacity of WIN55,212-2 was 
studied in vivo in BALB/c mice after intraperitoneal injection with LPS.
RESULTS: We show for the first time that the differentiation of hmoDCs in the 
presence of WIN55,212-2 generates tolerogenic WIN-hmoDCs that are less 
responsive to LPS stimulation and able to prime Tregs. WIN55,212-2 also impairs 
the pro-inflammatory polarization of human macrophages by inhibiting cytokine 
production, inflammasome activation and rescuing macrophages from pyroptotic 
cell death. Mechanistically, WIN55,212-2 induced a metabolic and epigenetic 
shift in macrophages by decreasing LPS-induced mTORC1 signaling, commitment to 
glycolysis and active histone marks in pro-inflammatory cytokine promoters. We 
confirmed these data in ex vivo LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages (PMΦs), 
which were also supported by the in vivo anti-inflammatory capacity of 
WIN55,212-2 in a LPS-induced sepsis mouse model.
CONCLUSION: Overall, we shed light into the molecular mechanisms by which 
cannabinoids exert anti-inflammatory properties in myeloid cells, which might 
well contribute to the future rational design of novel therapeutic strategies 
for inflammatory disorders.","Copyright © 2023 Pérez-Diego, Angelina, Martín-Cruz, de la Rocha-Muñoz,

diseases. Very few studies were done in south Indian population to observe the 
oral manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in relation to the 
cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, and this study mainly highlights the 
presenting complaint of HIV patients during their dental visit. The study was 
aimed to determine the chief complaints of patients along with oral 
manifestations of HIV and correlate them to CD4 count.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive HIV-positive patients were 
considered for the study. All the oral manifestations and the chief complaints 
along with the calculated CD4 counts were noted and the results were correlated. 
Spearman correlation was used for CD4 count and other oral manifestations.
RESULTS: The mean CD4 counts were 421 cells/mm3 with a standard deviation (SD) 
of 404.34 for the most common oral manifestation of burning mouth and 176.5 
cells/mm3 for the least common manifestation of malignancies. The CD4 count 
ranged from 120 to 1100 cells/mm3. The mean age and CD4 count were 38 years and 
398.86, respectively. There was a statistically significant correlation with 
candidiasis and gingivitis, and the rest of the conditions were insignificant.
CONCLUSION: The study results suggest that the chief complaint of presentation 
of an HIV-positive patient is pain due to carious teeth/abscess followed by 
burning mouth, with candidiasis being the most common disease.","DOI: 10.4103/ijdr.ijdr_627_22

novel type of immune checkpoint. This study was performed to explore the 
potential mechanism by which different domains of VISTA affect T-cell activation 
and search for potential interacting proteins.
METHODS: Stably transfected Jurkat cell lines were constructed to overexpress 
human VISTA (VISTA-FL), cytoplasmic domain deletion mutants (VISTA-ΔECD) and 
extracellular domain deletion mutants (VISTA- ΔCD). Empty vector (EV) control 
cell lines were constructed. Four stable cell lines were subjected to 
transcriptome sequencing after stimulation with PMA and PHA. The differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were analysed to explore the potential pathway by which 
VISTA inhibits T-cell activation. Proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network 
analysis was used to search for potential interacting proteins of VISTA.
RESULTS: In this study, 1256 DEGs were identified in Jurkat-VISTA-FL cells, 740 
DEGs in Jurkat-VISTA-ΔCD cells, and 5605 DEGs in Jurkat-VISTA-ΔECD cells 
compared with Jurkat-EV cells. DEGs were mainly enriched in pathways related to 
T-cell differentiation, T-cell receptor signalling pathway and T-cell migration 
in Jurkat-VISTA-ΔECD cells; with cholesterol biosynthesis in Jurkat-VISTA-ΔCD 
cells; and with the inflammatory response in Jurkat-VISTA-FL cells. HHLA2 and 
CTH were identified as potential partners that interact directly with VISTA. The 
results also show an indirect interaction between VISTA and PSGL-1.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the pathways by which VISTA is involved in 
T-cell activation and identified the potential binding partners of VISTA through 
RNA-seq, providing valuable resources for developing in-depth studies of the 
action mechanisms of VISTA as a potential target for cancer and inflammatory 
diseases.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.molimm.2023.03.021

nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (PDNKSCC), also known as 
lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC), is extremely limited due to its rarity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multi-institutional study enrolled 85 patients with 
thymic PDNKSCC. DNA in situ hybridization was performed to evaluate the EBV 
status of all 85 cases. Immunohistochemistry and next generation sequencing were 
performed to compare the differences in the clinicopathological and molecular 
features between EBV-related and EBV-unrelated PDNKSCC. Tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) were also analyzed by these methods.
RESULTS: The 85 cases were classified into 27 EBV-related PDNKSCCs (31.8 %) and 
58 EBV-unrelated PDNKSCCs (68.2 %) according to the EBV status, and 35 
Lymphoepithelioma pattern (LP) (41.2 %) and 50 desmoplastic pattern (DP) 
(58.8 %) according to the histological characteristics. Compared to the 
EBV-unrelated PDNKSCC, EBV-related PDNKSCC showed a younger patient predominance 
and more commonly displayed a LP subtype. Additionally, LP-type cases were 
divided into two groups: Group 1 (EBV-related, 20/85) and Group 2 
(EBV-unrelated, 15/85); the DP-type cases were divided into Group 3 
(EBV-unrelated, 43/85) and Group 4 (EBV-related, 7/85). The four Groups showed a 
significant association with patients' OS and PFS. EBV-related PDNKSCC had 
significantly higher PD-L1 + tumor cells (TCs) and PD-L1 + and CD8 + immune 
cells (ICs) than EBV-unrelated PDNKSCC. The tumor microenvironment immune type 
(TMIT) I (PDL1-Tumor+/CD8-High) was more common in EBV-related PDNKSCC, 
especially in Group 1(LP and EBV related) with more than 90 % cases belonged to 
TMIT I. Molecular analysis demonstrated that EBV-related PDNKSCC had a 
significantly higher tumour mutational burden and frequency of somatic mutations 
than EBV-unrelated cases.
CONCLUSIONS: EBV-related PDNKSCC, especially the Group 1, could be a candidate 
for immunotherapy and EBV positivity may provide an indication for the selection 
of targeted therapy due to their high tumour mutational burden.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2023.107178

pathophysiology of this complication is still unclear. We previously described 
the possibility to isolate lung mesenchymal cells (LMC) by culturing 
broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with pulmonary fibrosis or 
chronic lung allograft dysfunction. Aim of this study was to investigate the 
possibility to isolate and characterize LMC from BAL of patients that, two 
months after discharge for severe COVID19, show CT signs of post-COVID19 
fibrosis (Post-COVID) and in some cases has been considered transplant 
indication. Results were compared with those from BAL of patients with collagen 
tissue disease-associated interstitial fibrosis (CTD-ILD). BAL fluid levels of 
TGFβ, VEGF, TIMP2, RANTES, IL6, IL8, and PAI1 were assessed. LMC were cultured 
and expanded, phenotyped by flow cytometry, and tested for osteogenic and 
adipogenic differentiation. Finally, we tested immunomodulatory and 
proliferative capabilities, collagen I production + /- TGF-beta stimulation. BAL 
cytokine and growth factor levels were comparable in the two groups. Efficiency 
of isolation from BAL was 100% in post-COVID compared to 63% in CTD-ILD. LMC 
from post-COVID were positive for CD105, CD73, CD90, and negative for CD45, 
CD34, CD19 and HLA-DR as in CTD-ILD samples. Post-COVID LMC displayed higher 
collagen production with respect to CTD-ILD LMC. Immunomodulatory capacity 
towards lymphocytes was very low, while Post-COVID LMC significantly upregulated 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production by healthy PBMCs. Our preliminary data 
suggest that LMC from post-COVID19 fibrosis patients share several features with 
CTD-ILD ones but might have a higher response to fibrogenic signals and 
pro-inflammatory profile.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is an extremely malignant tumor and 
accounts for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Aspartate beta-hydroxylase 
domain containing 1 (ASPHD1) may participate in cancer progression through 
controlling α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. However, its role in skin 
cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) has not been well studied.
METHODS: The gene expression data of ASPDH1 and differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) from TCGA and GTEx were evaluated, and verified via the GEO database. 
Then, we performed GO/KEGG, GSEA, PPI network analysis to analyze the functional 
implications of the DEGs related to ASPHD1. Then, the association between the 
ASPHD1 expression and clinical parameters was investigated by Cox regression 
analysis. Subsequently, the survival time of SKCM patients was evaluated by 
plotting Kaplan-Meier curves. Moreover, we investigated the correlation between 
the ASPHD1 expression and lymphocytic infiltration by using the data from TISIDB 
and TIMER 2.0. Next, we explored the association between ASPHD1 expression and 
drug sensitivity. Finally, we validate the expression differences by analyzing 
the results of qPCR, Western blot from human normal epidermal melanocytes and 
melanoma cells, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) from non-tumor skin as well as 
melanoma tissues.
RESULTS: The ASPHD1 expression level was significantly upregulated in several 
cancers, including SKCM especially SKCM-metastasis tissues, and patients with an 
increased ASPHD1 expression had longer overall survival time than low expression 
ones. The functional enrichment analysis of ASPHD1-related DEGs showed an 
association with cell development regulation and tumorigenic pathways. 
Furthermore, the increased ASPHD1 expression level was associated with the level 
of immunostimulors, immunoinhibitors, chemokines, and TILs, such as CD4+, CD8+ T 
cell, mast cell, Th2 cell, and dendritic cell. More interesting, we found that 
ASPHD1 expression was tightly associated with CTLA4 and CD276 which are immune 
checkpoint markers. Moreover, the upregulated expression of ASPHD1 exhibited 
higher IC50 values for 24 chemotherapy drugs, including doxorubicin, and 
masitinib. Finally, the differential expression of ASPHD1 in SKCM was validated 
by the results of qPCR, Western blot, and IHC.
CONCLUSION: The expression of ASPHD1 in SKCM patients is closely related to 
patient survival. ASPHD1 may participate in the regulation of tumor immune 
microenvironment. Additionally, it may serve as a prognostic biomarker for SKCM 
and future in-depth studies are necessary to explore its value.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-10625-8

travel by many residents. However, the concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) 
in the air of a subway platform is higher than that of the ground level or 
carriage. Moreover, the composition and source of subway PM2.5 differ from those 
of atmospheric PM2.5. Currently, there is insufficient research on the impact of 
subway PM2.5 on health. In this study, intratracheally subway PM2.5-inoculated 
wild type (WT) and Rag1-/- mice, lacking functional T cells and B cells, were 
used to investigate the potential of subway PM2.5 exposure to cause 
extrapulmonary organ injuries. Subway PM2.5 increased inflammatory cells 
infiltration, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, as well as 
monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 gene and protein expression, 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction, and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR4, 
myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor (NF)-κB levels in 
liver, kidney, spleen, and thymus in a dose-dependent fashion in WT mice. Subway 
PM2.5 exposure resulted in slight macrophage (F4/80+) and neutrophil (Ly6G+) 
infiltration and caused no increase in the protein levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, 
or COX-2 in the liver, kidneys, spleen, and thymus of Rag1-/- mice. These 
results demonstrate a dose-response manner between subway PM2.5 exposure and 
inflammatory injuries of extrapulmonary organs, which could be related to the 
TLR/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. Subway PM2.5-induced extrapulmonary organ

OX40 co-stimulation or CTLA-4 blockade can eradicate melanomas containing 
antigen escape variants. As expected, early on-target recognition of melanoma

responses by helping B cells form germinal centers (GCs) and the production of 
high-affinity antibodies. However, aberrant Tfh cell expansion also contributes 
to the generation of self-reactive autoantibodies and promotes 
autoantibody-mediated autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE). Protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha isoform (PP2A Cα) 
expression levels are elevated in peripheral T cells of SLE patients and 
positively correlate with autoantibody titers and disease activity. Here, we 
demonstrate a critical role of PP2A in Tfh differentiation by using T cell 
restricted PP2A Cα deficient mice. We observed impaired Tfh differentiation and 
GC response in two different classical Tfh induction models. Mechanistic studies 
revealed that downregulation of protein translation of the Tfh lineage 
transcription factor BCL6 in PP2A deficient T cells. Importantly, we found that 
PP2A deficiency by either gene knockout or chemical inhibition alleviated lupus 
severity in mice. Lastly, we confirmed a positive correlation between PP2A Cα 
and BCL6 protein levels in human CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE. In 
summary, our study revealed a critical role of PP2A in regulating Tfh cells and

levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients clinically diagnosed with 
pulmonary tuberculosis.
METHOD: Pulmonary tuberculosis-related datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database were analyzed, and DE-miRNAs were screened for Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment 
to construct a DE-miRNA-DE-mRNA network. The peripheral blood lymphocytes of 10 
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, 10 patients with rifampicin-resistant 
tuberculosis and 10 healthy volunteers were selected for validation of RNA 
expression levels. qRT-PCR was done to verify the expression of DE-miRNA, and 
western blotting was done to check the expression levels of genes of associated 
pathways.
RESULTS: Differential expression of miR-660 was found in pulmonary tuberculosis 
through data analysis and literature mining. The differential expression was 
also confirmed by qRT-PCR in samples from patients and healthy controls. The 
expression of miR-660 was significantly upregulated (p < 0.01) in patients with 
pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis compared 
with the healthy controls. According to western blotting results, the expression 
levels of P-NF-κB and AKT in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and NF-κB, 
P-NF-κB, AKT and p-AKT in patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis were 
significantly upregulated (p < 0.01).

and people. The so called intra-epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) compartment largely 
consist of T cells. Interestingly, the specific regulation and contribution of 
IELs in the context of inflammatory bowel disease remains poorly understood, in 
part due to the lack of appropriate analysis tools. Powerful, label-free methods 
could ultimately provide access to this cell population and hence give valuable 
insight into IEL biology and even more to their disease-related functionalities. 
Raman spectroscopy has demonstrated over the last few years its potential for 
reliable cell characterization and differentiation, but its utility in regard to 
IEL exploration remains unknown. To address this question experimentally, we 
utilized a murine, T cell-driven experimental model system which is accepted to 
model human gut inflammation. Here, we repopulated the small intestinal IEL 
compartment (SI IELs) of Rag1-deficient mice endogenously lacking T cells by 
transferring naïve CD4+ T helper cells intraperitoneally. Using multivariate 
statistical analysis, high-throughput Raman spectroscopy managed to define a 
cell subpopulation ex vivo within the SI IEL pool of mice previously receiving T 
cells in vivo that displayed characteristic spectral features of lymphocytes. 
Raman data sets matched flow cytometry analyses with the latter identifying T 
cell receptor (TCR)αβ+ CD4+ T cell population in SI IELs from T cell-transferred 
mice, but not from control mice, in an abundance comparable to the one detected 
by Raman spectroscopy. Hence, in this study, we provide experimental evidence 
for high-throughput Raman spectroscopy to be a novel, future tool to reliably 
identify and potentially further characterize the T cell pool of small 
intestinal IELs ex vivo.","DOI: 10.1039/d3an00074e

self-MHC-peptide expressed in thymic epithelial cells, which contributes to the 
formation of a T cell repertoire. However, it is not well understood whether 
additional signals from epithelial cells are required to drive positive 
selection. In this study, we found that one of the TNFR superfamily members, 
herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), when expressed on thymocytes provides 
signals for positive selection. HVEM deficiency in double-positive (DP) 
thymocytes impaired positive selection of CD8 thymocytes. HVEM-deficient 
thymocytes in OT-1 TCR transgenic mice exhibited significant defects in positive 
selection and impaired CD69 upregulation of selected thymocytes. HVEM ligands 
(lymphotoxin-like, exhibits inducible expression, and competes with HSV 
glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes, and B and T 
lymphocyte attenuator) were expressed in cortical thymic epithelial cells. Weak 
TCR ligation combined with HVEM signals enhanced ERK activation in DP thymocytes 
developed in vitro. Insufficient signals for positive selection in 
HVEM-deficient DP thymocytes led to the development of innate memory-like CD8 T 
cells expressing high levels of CD122, along with the increased development of 
PLZF+ NKT cells. These results suggest that thymocytes receive activation 
signals through HVEM during positive selection. Thus, our findings provide 
evidence that the threshold of thymocyte positive selection is set by signals 
from TCR in association with HVEM.","Copyright © 2023 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.2200748

however, factors that modulate their phenotype and function have not been 
completely elucidated. Cytokines IL-12 and IL-27 have recognized roles in 
promoting CD8+ T cells' effector function and mediated antitumor responses. 
Tumor-specific CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can be identified 
based on surface expression of CD39, whereas bystander CD8+ TILs do not express 
this enzyme. It is currently unclear how and why tumor-specific CD8+ T cells 
uniquely express CD39. Given the important roles of IL-12 and IL-27 in promoting 
CD8+ T cell functionality, we investigated whether these cytokines could 
modulate CD39 expression on these cells. Using in vitro stimulation assays, we 
identified that murine splenic CD8+ T cells differentially upregulate CD39 in 
the presence of IL-12 and IL-27. Subsequently, we assessed the exhaustion 
profile of IL-12- and IL-27-induced CD39+CD8+ T cells. Despite the greatest 
frequency of exhausted CD39+CD8+ T cells after activation with IL-12, as 
demonstrated by the coexpression of TIM-3+PD-1+LAG-3+ and reduced degranulation 
capacity, these cells retained the ability to produce IFN-γ. IL-27-induced 
CD39+CD8+ T cells expressed PD-1 but did not exhibit a terminally exhausted 
phenotype. IL-27 was able to attenuate IL-12-mediated inhibitory receptor 
expression on CD39+CD8+ T cells but did not rescue degranulation ability. Using 
an immunogenic neuro-2a mouse model, inhibiting IL-12 activity reduced CD39+CD8+ 
TIL frequency compared with controls without changing the overall CD8+ TIL 
frequency. These results provide insight into immune regulators of CD39 
expression on CD8+ T cells and further highlight the differential impact of 
CD39-inducing factors on the phenotype and effector functions of CD8+ T cells.","Copyright © 2023 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.2200897

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the differences of transcriptome profile 
between 2 groups of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients with 
distinct outcomes and identify potential biomarkers for recurrence.
METHODS: RNA sequencing was performed in 2 groups of HGSOC patients with similar 
demographic characteristics but exhibiting distinct progression-free survival 
(PFS). Transcriptome data of poor response (PR; PFS ≤6 months) and good response 
(GR; PFS ≥12 months) group were compared. We employed xCell to evaluate the 
abundance of 63 cells in tumor microenvironment. The predictive value of 
recurrence-related tumor infiltration cells was validated in cohort data from 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The 
weighted correlation network analysis was performed to identify the genes 
related to cell infiltration.
RESULTS: PR patients exhibited a distinct tumor infiltration immune 
cells-related transcriptional profile compared to GR patients, such as lower 
signatures of leukocyte differentiation, activation and chemotaxis. The fraction 
of T-helper 2 (Th2) cells infiltration was significantly higher in PR group than 
in GR group. High infiltration of Th2 was significantly associated with 
unfavorable prognosis in the GEO cohort (area under the curve=0.84 at 6 months 
recurrence) and TCGA cohort (p=0.008). Genes enriched to extracellular matrix 
organization and integrin binding were relevant to Th2 infiltration.
CONCLUSION: Patients with HGSOC having shorter PFS exhibited a distinct gene 
signature that related to tumor-infiltrating immune cells. The level of Th2 
infiltration could facilitate patient recurrence risk stratification and may be 
a promising biomarker for prognosis prediction and immune-related treatment.","© 2023. Asian Society of Gynecologic Oncology, Korean Society of Gynecologic

explore the regulation of HSC and LSC maintenance, the underlying molecular 
mechanism remains obscure. Here, we observe that the expression of

increased in HSCs after stresses exposure. Of note, deletion of Tespa1 results 
in short-term expansion but long-term exhaustion of HSCs in mice under stress 
conditions due to impaired quiescence. Mechanistically, Tespa1 can interact with 
CSN subunit 6 (CSN6), a subunit of COP9 signalosome, to prevent 
ubiquitination-mediated degradation of c-Myc protein in HSCs. As a consequence, 
forcing c-Myc expression improves the functional defect of Tespa1-null HSCs. On 
the other hand, Tespa1 is identified to be highly enriched in human acute

poorly understood. In this study, we investigated its effect on dendritic cells 
(DCs) and CD4+ T cells, which are essential for the development of BU. Our 
results showed that the expression of PDL1 and IRF1 was significantly decreased 
in DCs from active BU patients, and IFNα2a could significantly upregulate PDL1 
expression in an IRF1-dependent manner. IFNα2a-treated DCs induced CD4+ T cells 
apoptosis and inhibited the Th1/Th17 immune response in association with reduced 
secretion of IFN-γ and IL-17. We also found that IFNα2a promoted Th1 cell 
differentiation and IL-10 secretion by CD4+ T cells. Finally, a comparison of 
patients before and after IFNα2a therapy revealed that the frequencies of 
Th1/Th17 cells significantly decreased in association with remission of uveitis 
after IFNα2a therapy. Collectively, these results show that IFNα2a could exert 
its effects by modulating the function of DCs and CD4+ T cells in BU.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.clim.2023.109303

the diamond-backed terrapin, Malaclemys terrapin, population has seen 
significant declines. Associated with the illegal wildlife trade, occasions 
arise in which terrapins are confiscated, and no standard operating procedures 
exist for repatriation into the wild. To develop such procedures, an 
understanding of the pathogens circulating in the wild diamond-backed terrapin 
population in New Jersey is needed. We sampled 30 wild female diamond-backed 
terrapins for herpesvirus, Mycoplasmopsis, ranavirus, and intestinal and blood 
parasites and performed white blood cell counts and differentials and evaluated 
biochemistry values. Terrapins had an average age of 10 yr (8-15 yr), and 70% 
were gravid at the time of sampling. Thirty-three percent of the sampled 
northern diamond-backed terrapins were positive for Mycoplasmopsis sp., and all 
were negative for ranavirus and herpesviruses. Occasional blood parasites were 
found, and few intestinal parasites were noted. There was no significant 
difference between gravid status and any of the blood parameters (P<0.05). Blood 
chemistry values appeared to vary according to feeding activity; no differences 
were noted in the values in relation to gravid status. Four terrapins had 
heterophil to lymphocyte (H:L) ratios above 4.5, significantly higher than the 
other terrapins sampled, which may indicate inflammation. Two of the four had 
Mycoplasmopsis, one sample was contaminated by other bacteria and was discarded, 
and one was negative. No significant difference was found between Mycoplasmopsis 
infection status and H:L ratio (P=0.926). Our findings, though conducted on a 
small number of female terrapins at a specific time point, provide data on the

modulated by the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2RX7), a cation cannel activated by 
high extracellular concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
METHODS: In vivo analysis was performed in the Plasmodium chabaudi model of 
malaria in view of the great relevance of this infectious disease for human 
health, as well as the availability of data concerning Th1/Tfh differentiation.
RESULTS: We show that P2RX7 induces T-bet expression and aerobic glycolysis in 
splenic CD4+ T cells that respond to malaria, at a time prior to Th1/Tfh 
polarization. Cell-intrinsic P2RX7 signaling sustains the glycolytic pathway and 
causes bioenergetic mitochondrial stress in activated CD4+ T cells. We also show 
in vitro the phenotypic similarities of Th1-conditioned CD4+ T cells that do not 
express P2RX7 and those in which the glycolytic pathway is pharmacologically 
inhibited. In addition, in vitro ATP synthase blockade and the consequent 
inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, which drives cellular metabolism for 
aerobic glycolysis, is sufficient to promote rapid CD4+ T cell proliferation and 
polarization to the Th1 profile in the absence of P2RX7.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that P2RX7-mediated metabolic reprograming 
for aerobic glycolysis is a key event for Th1 differentiation and suggest that 
ATP synthase inhibition is a downstream effect of P2RX7 signaling that 
potentiates the Th1 response.","Copyright © 2023 Salles, Raeder, Angeli, Santiago, de Souza, Ramalho, Câmara,

appendicitis cases and compare them with acute appendicitis cases in terms of 
parameters such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein 
(CRP)-to-lymphocyte ratio (CLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
systemic immune-inflammation index (SII). We primarily aimed to evaluate the 
utility of SII in the differential diagnosis of Enterobius-associated 
appendicitis. Methods The appendectomy specimens of pediatric patients who were 
operated on for acute appendicitis between June 2016 and August 2022 were 
retrospectively evaluated. Enterobius-associated appendicitis cases 
were included for analysis. All patients were evaluated regarding age, gender, 
blood count, surgery, and pathology reports. Pathology reports were evaluated 
for the presence of histological signs of acute appendicitis. The patients were 
classified into an Enterobius-associated appendicitis group and a regular acute 
appendicitis group. CRP, white blood cell (WBC), red cell distribution width 
(RDW), neutrophils, lymphocytes, NLR, monocytes, eosinophils, platelet (PLT), 
PLR, CLR, and SII values were compared between the two groups. Results Eleven 
cases of Enterobius-associated appendicitis were identified out of 430 total 
cases (2.55%) examined. The mean age of the group with acute appendicitis was 
12.83 ±3.16 years, while the mean age of the group with Enterobius-associated 
appendicitis was 8.55 ±2.54 years. There was no statistically significant 
difference in terms of CRP, WBC, RDW, lymphocytes, neutrophils, NLR, monocytes, 
eosinophils, PLT, PLR, and CLR values between the two groups (p>0.05). However, 
when the SII values of the participants were analyzed, it was observed that the 
SII values of the participants in the regular appendicitis group were 
significantly higher than those of the participants in the Enterobius group 
(p<0.05). Among the 11 Enterobius-associated appendicitis patients, seven 
appendectomy specimens revealed no inflammation and were regarded as negative 
appendectomy (63.63%). Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate the 
utility of preoperative SII evaluation in Enterobius-associated appendicitis. 
SII is a simple, easy-to-calculate indicator of Enterobius-associated 
appendicitis and aids in the preoperative differential diagnosis of acute

mucin-domain-containing molecule 3(Tim-3) may be used as the biomarkers for the 
therapy in patients with peritoneal neoplasms. In the current study, the 
differential percentages of peripheral PD-1 and Tim-3 are explored to 
investigate whether to associate with primary sites and pathological types of 
patients with peritoneal neoplasms or not. We also investigated the frequencies 
of PD-1 and Tim-3 on circulating Lymphocytes, CD3 + T cells, CD3 + CD4 + T cells 
and CD3 + CD8 + T cells if would correlate with the progression-free survival of 
peritoneal neoplasms patients.
METHODS: 115 patients with peritoneal neoplasms were recruited, subjected to 
multicolor flow cytometric analyses of the percentages of PD-1 and Tim-3 
receptors of circulating Lymphocytes, CD3 + T cells, CD3 + CD4 + T cells and 
CD3 + CD8 + T cells. The peritoneal neoplasms patients were divided into primary 
group and secondary group depending on whether the tumor had primary focus and 
limited to peritoneal tumor or not. Then all the patients were regrouped by the 
pathological types of neoplasms (adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, and 
pseudomyxoma). The secondary peritoneal neoplasms group was divided into the 
different primary site groups (colon, gastric, gynecology). This study also 
enrolled 38 cases of normal volunteers. The above markers were explored by flow 
cytometer, to find the differential levels in peritoneal neoplasms patients 
compared with normal group in peripheral blood.
RESULTS: Higher levels of CD4 + T lymphocytes, CD8 + T lymphocytes, 
CD45 + PD-1 + lymphocytes, CD3 + PD-1 + T cells, CD3 + CD4 + PD-1 + T cells, 
CD3 + CD8 + PD-1 + T cells and CD45 + Tim-3 + lymphocytes were found in

0.004, 0.047, 0.046, 0.044, 0.014, 0.038 and 0.017). Compared with primary 
peritoneal neoplasms group, the percentages of CD45 + PD-1 + lymphocytes, 
CD3 + PD-1 + T cells, and CD3 + CD4 + PD-1 + T cells were increased in the 
secondary peritoneal neoplasms group (the p value was respectively 0.010, 0.044, 
and 0.040), while PD-1 did not correlate with the primary sites in secondary 
group (P > 0.05). Tim-3 had no statistical differences in primary peritoneal 
neoplasms group compared with secondary group (p > 0.05), but CD45 + Tim-3+% 
lymphocytes, CD3 + Tim-3+%T cells, and CD3 + CD4 + Tim-3 + T cells were 
associated with different secondary sites of peritoneal neoplasms (p < 0.05). In 
the different pathological type groups, the percentages of 
CD45 + PD-1 + lymphocytes, CD3 + PD-1 + T cells presented the higher levels in 
adenocarcinoma group compared with mesothelioma group (p = 0.048, p = 0.045). 
The frequencies of CD45 + PD-1 + lymphocytes and CD3 + PD-1 + T cells in 
peripheral blood were associated with progression-free survival (PFS).
CONCLUSIONS: Our work uncovers peripheral PD-1 and Tim-3 percentages are 
associated with primary sites and pathological types of peritoneal neoplasms.

(#)Contributed equally","Regulation of intron retention (IR), a form of alternative splicing, is a newly 
recognized checkpoint in gene expression. Since there are numerous abnormalities 
in gene expression in the prototypic autoimmune disease systemic lupus

with this disease. We, therefore, studied global gene expression and IR patterns 
of lymphocytes in SLE patients. We analyzed RNA-seq data from peripheral blood T 
cell samples from 14 patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
and 4 healthy controls and a second, independent data set of RNA-seq data from B 
cells from16 SLE patients and 4 healthy controls. We identified intron retention 
levels from 26,372 well annotated genes as well as differential gene expression 
and tested for differences between cases and controls using unbiased 
hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. We followed with 
gene-disease enrichment analysis and gene-ontology enrichment analysis. Finally, 
we then tested for significant differences in intron retention between cases and 
controls both globally and with respect to specific genes. Overall decreased IR 
was found in T cells from one cohort and B cells from another cohort of patients 
with SLE and was associated with increased expression of numerous genes, 
including those encoding spliceosome components. Different introns within the 
same gene displayed both up- and down-regulated retention profiles indicating a 
complex regulatory mechanism. These results indicate that decreased IR in immune 
cells is characteristic of patients with active SLE and may contribute to the 
abnormal expression of specific genes in this autoimmune disease.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-31890-4

specific cell types and the genome region containing GATA3 contains dozens of

performed a high-throughput tiling deletion screen of a 2 Mb genome region in

in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Increasing evidence indicates that 
peripheral CD4+ T cells, a vital pathological component of PD, have been 
implicated in systemic inflammation activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
dysfunction, central nervous system infiltration, and consequent neurons 
degeneration. However, there is no consensus on CD4+ T cell types' exact 
phenotypic characteristics in systemic inflammation and the mechanism of CD4+ T 
cells traffic into the BBB in patients with PD. In this study, we employed 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to elucidate the potential mechanism of T 
cells on the breakdown of BBB. The PD-associated Cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4+ 
CTLs) were characterized by a significant increase in proportion as well as 
enhancement of interferon-gamma (IFNG) response and cell adhesion. Meanwhile, 
TBX21, IRF1 and NFATC2, identified as the key transcription factors in effector 
CD4+ T cells differentiation, induced overexpression of target genes-IFNG in 
CD4+ CTLs. Interestingly, endothelial cells (ECs) in PD patients were discovered 
to be more responsive to IFNG than other cell types of midbrain. Furthermore, 
the cell-cell communication analysis between CD4+ T cells and midbrain cells 
identified IFNG/IFNGR1 and SPP1/ITGB1 as the ligand-receptor pairs to mediate 
CD4+ CTLs' infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) through the

diseases, the development of which are associated with the expansion of 
pathogenic T lymphocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells may be an attractive 
therapeutic option for patients with RA or OA due to the regenerative and 
immunomodulatory abilities of these cells. The infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) is a 
rich and easily available source of mesenchymal stem cells (adipose-derived stem 
cells, ASCs). However, the phenotypic, potential and immunomodulatory properties 
of ASCs have not been fully characterised. We aimed to evaluate the phenotype, 
regenerative potential and effects of IFP-derived ASCs from RA and OA patients 
on CD4+ T cell proliferation. The MSC phenotype was assessed using flow 
cytometry. The multipotency of MSCs was evaluated on the basis of their ability 
to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts. The 
immunomodulatory activities of MSCs were examined in co-cultures with sorted 
CD4+ T cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The concentrations of 
soluble factors involved in ASC-dependent immunomodulatory activities were 
assessed in co-culture supernatants using ELISA. We found that ASCs with PPIs 
from RA and OA patients maintain the ability to differentiate into adipocytes, 
chondrocytes and osteoblasts. ASCs from RA and OA patients also showed a similar 
phenotype and comparable abilities to inhibit CD4+ T cell proliferation, which 
was dependent on the induction of soluble factors The results of our study 
constitute the basis for further research on the therapeutic potential of ASCs 
in the treatment of patients with RA and OA.","DOI: 10.3390/pharmaceutics15031003

inflammation, autoimmune dysfunction, and cartilage and bone destruction. In 
this review, we summarized the available reports on the protective effects of 
Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) on RA in terms of anti-inflammatory, 
immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic and osteoprotective effects. Firstly, GLP 
inhibits RA synovial fibroblast (RASF) proliferation and migration, modulates 
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and reduces synovial inflammation. 
Secondly, GLP regulates the proliferation and differentiation of 
antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, inhibits phagocytosis by 
mononuclear macrophages and nature killer (NK) cells and regulates the ratio of 
M1, M2 and related inflammatory cytokines. In addition, GLP produced activities 
in balancing humoral and cellular immunity, such as regulating immunoglobulin 
production, modulating T and B lymphocyte proliferative responses and cytokine 
release, exhibiting immunomodulatory effects. Thirdly, GLP inhibits angiogenesis 
through the direct inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation and 
induction of cell death and the indirect inhibition of vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) production in the cells. Finally, GLP can inhibit the 
production of matrix metalloproteinases and promote osteoblast formation, 
exerting protective effects on bone and articular cartilage. It is suggested 
that GLP may be a promising agent for the treatment of RA.","DOI: 10.3390/molecules28062483

syndrome in children (MIS-C) in April 2020, the diagnostic challenge has been to 
recognize this syndrome and to differentiate it from other clinically similar 
pathologies such as Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Our 
objective is to compare clinical signs, laboratory data and instrumental 
investigations between patients with MIS-C, KD and TSS. Materials and Methods: 
This retrospective observational study was conducted at the Children's Clinical 
University Hospital, Latvia (CCUH). We collected data from all pediatric 
patients <18 years of age, who met the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention case definition for MIS-C, and who presented to CCUH between December 
2020 and December 2021. We also retrospectively reviewed data from inpatient 
medical records of patients <18 years of age diagnosed as having KD and TSS at 
CCUH between December 2015 and December 2021. Results: In total, 81 patients 
were included in this study: 39 (48.1%) with KD, 29 (35.8%) with MIS-C and 13 
(16.1%) with TSS. In comparison with TSS and KD, patients with MIS-C more often 
presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain (p < 0.001), diarrhea 
(p = 0.003)), shortness of breath (p < 0.02) and headache (p < 0.003). All MIS-C 
patients had cardiovascular involvement and 93.1% of MIS-C patients fulfilled KD 
criteria, showing higher prevalence than in other research. Patients with KD had 
higher prevalence of cervical lymphadenopathy (p < 0.006) and arthralgias (p < 
0.001). In comparison with KD and TSS, MIS-C patients had higher levels of 
ferritin (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p = 0.04) and cardiac biomarkers, but lower 
levels of platelets and lymphocytes (p < 0.001). KD patients tended to have 
lower peak C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), but higher levels of platelets. 
Acute kidney injury was more often observed in TSS patients (p = 0.01). 
Pathological changes in electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography were 
significantly more often observed in MIS-C patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: 
This research shows that MIS-C, KD and TSS have several clinical similarities 
and additional investigations are required for reaching final diagnosis. All the 
patients with suspected MIS-C diagnosis should be examined for possible 
cardiovascular involvement including cardiac biomarkers, ECG and 
echocardiography.","DOI: 10.3390/medicina59030626

and microscopic colitis (lymphocytic and collagenous colitis) are 
immune-mediated diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, with distinct 
pathophysiology.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the prevalence of autoimmune diseases between 
microscopic colitis (MC) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in our patient 
cohorts in their medical history.
METHODS: We collected data from 611 patients (508 with IBD, 103 with MC). We 
recorded cases of other autoimmune diseases. The screened documentation was 
written in the period between 2008 and 2022. We sought to determine whether 
colonic involvement had an impact on the prevalence of autoimmune diseases.
RESULTS: Ulcerative colitis patients and patients with colonic-predominant 
Crohn's disease had a greater propensity for autoimmune conditions across the 
disease course than patients with ileal-predominant Crohn's disease. 
Gluten-related disorders were more common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative 
colitis, and slightly more common than in microscopic colitis. In ulcerative 
colitis, 10 patients had non-differentiated collagenosis registered, which can 
later develop into a definite autoimmune disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Predominantly colonic involvement can be a predisposing factor for 
developing additional autoimmune disorders in IBD. Ulcerative colitis patients 
may have laboratory markers of autoimmunity, without fulfilling the diagnostic 
criteria for definitive autoimmune disorders (non-differentiated collagenosis).","DOI: 10.3390/life13030652

inflammatory diseases. IL-38 expression has been mainly observed not only in 
epithelia, but also in cells of the immune system, including macrophages and B 
cells. Given the association of both IL-38 and B cells with chronic 
inflammation, we explored if IL-38 affects B cell biology. IL-38-deficient mice 
showed higher amounts of plasma cells (PC) in lymphoid organs but, conversely, 
lower levels of plasmatic antibody titers. Exploring underlying mechanisms in 
human B cells revealed that exogenously added IL-38 did not significantly affect 
early B cell activation or differentiation into plasma cells, even though IL-38 
suppressed upregulation of CD38. Instead, IL-38 mRNA expression was transiently 
upregulated during the differentiation of human B cells to plasma cells in 
vitro, and knocking down IL-38 during early B cell differentiation increased 
plasma cell generation, while reducing antibody production, thus reproducing the 
murine phenotype. Although this endogenous role of IL-38 in B cell 
differentiation and antibody production did not align with an immunosuppressive 
function, autoantibody production induced in mice by repeated IL-18 injections 
was enhanced in an IL-38-deficient background. Taken together, our data suggest 
that cell-intrinsic IL-38 promotes antibody production at baseline but 
suppresses the production of autoantibodies in an inflammatory context, which 
may partially explain its protective role during chronic inflammation.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24065676

Leukemia were characterized by quantifying and clustering 24 total and 
phosphorylated DDR proteins. Overall, three protein expression patterns (C1-C3) 
were identified and were associated as an independent predictor of distinct 
patient overall survival outcomes. Patients within clusters C1 and C2 had poorer 
survival outcomes and responses to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituxan 
chemotherapy compared to patients within cluster C3. However, DDR protein 
expression patterns were not prognostic in more modern therapies with BCL2 
inhibitors or a BTK/PI3K inhibitor. Individually, nine of the DDR proteins were 
prognostic for predicting overall survival and/or time to first treatment. When 
looking for other proteins that may be associated with or influenced by DDR 
expression patterns, our differential expression analysis found that cell cycle 
and adhesion proteins were lower in clusters compared to normal CD19 controls. 
In addition, cluster C3 had a lower expression of MAPK proteins compared to the 
poor prognostic patient clusters thus implying a potential regulatory connection 
between adhesion, cell cycle, MAPK, and DDR signaling in CLL. Thus, assessing 
the proteomic expression of DNA damage proteins in CLL provided novel insights 
for deciphering influences on patient outcomes and expanded our understanding of 
the potential complexities and effects of DDR cell signaling.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24065481

of ongoing research, with a whole-body dose of 2 Gy proposed as a safe limit. 
This article evaluates the RIT-induced cytogenetic damage in two rare 
differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) cases, including the first follow-up study 
of a pediatric DTC patient. Chromosome damage in the patient's peripheral blood 
lymphocytes (PBL) was examined using conventional metaphase assay, painting of 
chromosomes 2, 4, and 12 (FISH), and multiplex fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (mFISH). Patient 1 (female, 1.6 y.o.) received four RIT courses 
over 1.1 years. Patient 2 (female, 49 y.o.) received 12 courses over 6.4 years, 
the last two of which were examined. Blood samples were collected before and 3-4 
days after the treatment. Chromosome aberrations (CA) analyzed by conventional 
and FISH methods were converted to a whole-body dose accounting for the dose 
rate effect. The mFISH method showed an increase in total aberrant cell 
frequency following each RIT course, while cells carrying unstable aberrations 
predominated in the yield. The proportion of cells containing stable CA 
associated with long-term cytogenetic risk remained mostly unchanged during 
follow-up for both patients. A one-time administration of RIT was safe, as the 
threshold of 2 Gy for the whole-body dose was not exceeded. The risk of side 
effects projected from RIT-attributable cytogenetic damage was low, suggesting a 
good long-term prognosis. In rare cases, such as the ones reviewed in this 
study, individual planning based on cytogenetic biodosimetry is strongly 
recommended.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24065128

inflammation response index (SIRI), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), 
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
radiomic metrics (quantitative descriptors of image content) extracted from MRI 
sequences by machine learning increase the efficacy of proper presurgical 
differentiation between benign and malignant salivary gland tumors.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 117 patients with salivary gland tumors was 
conducted between January 2015 and November 2022. Univariate analyses with 
nonparametric tests and multivariate analyses with machine learning approaches 
were used.
RESULTS: Inflammatory biomarkers showed statistically significant differences (p 
< 0.05) in the Kruskal-Wallis test based on median values in discriminating 
Warthin tumors from pleomorphic adenoma and malignancies. The accuracy of NLR, 
PLR, SII, and SIRI was 0.88, 0.74, 0.76, and 0.83, respectively. Analysis of 
radiomic metrics to discriminate Warthin tumors from pleomorphic adenoma and 
malignancies showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in nine 
radiomic features. The best multivariate analysis result was obtained from an 
SVM model with 86% accuracy, 68% sensitivity, and 91% specificity for six 
features.

mechanisms, including immune checkpoints. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated 
protein-4 (CTLA-4) is an immune checkpoint receptor that downregulates 
anti-tumour immune responses, with evidence of involvement in HNC. The less 
studied, alternatively spliced, soluble isoform (sCTLA-4) also plays an 
immunosuppressive role that contributes to immune escape. We quantified sCTLA-4 
in normal, potentially malignant, and malignant oral and oropharyngeal tissues 
to elucidate any role in tumourigenesis and identify its potential as a 
biomarker for diagnosis and patient stratification. Methods: Normal, low- and 
high-grade epithelial dysplasia, and squamous cell carcinoma oral and 
oropharyngeal biopsies were selectively stained for sCTLA-4 and quantified using 
the image analysis software QuPath. Results: Distinct sCTLA-4 staining patterns 
were observed, in which normal epithelial sCTLA-4 expression correlated with 
keratinocyte differentiation, while disrupted expression, both in intensity and 
localisation, was observed in dysplastic and neoplastic tissues. Conclusions: 
Our data indicate an additional, previously unknown role for sCTLA-4 in 
epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. Furthermore, our findings 
suggest the potential of sCTLA-4 as a biomarker for predicting disease 
progression and patient stratification for targeted HNC therapies.","DOI: 10.3390/cancers15061696

with each other, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation may have a prognostic 
value in cancer. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) plays a pivotal role in glucose 
transport and metabolism and it is aberrantly expressed in various cancer types. 
We evaluated the differential expression of GLUT1, along with 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), and then analyzed their prognostic significance.
METHODS: A total of 163 patients with resectable NSCLC were included in this 
study. Tumor sections were immunohistochemically stained for GLUT1 and GLUT3. 
Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured by preoperative FDG-PET, 
and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) were derived from pretreatment blood count.
RESULTS: GLUT1 and GLUT3 was positively expressed in 74.8% and 6.1% of the NSCLC 
tissues, respectively. GLUT1 expression was significantly correlated with 
squamous cell carcinoma histology, poor differentiation, high pathologic stage, 
old age, male, smoking, and high SUVmax (>7) (all p < 0.05). The squamous cell 
carcinoma and smoker group also showed significantly higher SUVmax (both p < 
0.001). Systemic inflammation markers, including NLR, PLR, and LMR, were 
positively correlated with high SUVmax (all p < 0.05). High GLUT1 expression, 
high SUVmax, high NLR, and low LMR, were significantly associated with poor 
overall survival in patients with NSCLC. However, in the multivariate survival 
analysis, LMR was an independent prognostic factor overall (HR 1.86, 95% CI 
1.05-3.3) and for the stage I/II cohort (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.24-4.3) (all p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammatory markers-NLR, PLR, and LMR are strongly 
correlated with the SUVmax and are indicators of aggressive tumor behavior. 
Specifically, LMR is a promising prognostic biomarker in NSCLC patients.","DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics13061013

prevention of melanoma development, it remains challenging in terms of diagnosis 
and treatment. To improve the clinical situation of patients, it would be 
especially beneficial to develop prognostic methods for the effective and 
continuous assessment of the disease course. The solution could lie in the 
selection of effective biomarkers derived from the tumor microenvironment, 
increasing the effectiveness of melanoma prognoses and monitoring. Hence, in 
this study, we evaluated the number of circulating melanoma cells (CMCs) in 
representative blood samples of melanoma patients vs. healthy controls, as well 
as the proportion of particular cytotoxic T cells in the total lymphocyte and 
leukocyte population as a reflection of immune resistance. The results were 
correlated with the clinical parameters of the patients to examine the potential 
value of CMC quantification and lymphoid cell phenotyping in melanoma 
diagnostics, prognostics, and treatment outcome monitoring. The CMC numbers were 
significantly higher in melanoma patients than in healthy controls. However, an 
analysis of the correlations between the baseline CMC counts and the clinical 
parameters found no significant results. In turn, we found significant 
differences between the groups in the percentage of various profiles of CD8+ 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes characterized by TIGIT and TIM-3 differential 
expression. Importantly, the CMC number correlated with CD8+TIGIT+ and 
CD8+TIGIT+TIM-3- cytotoxic T cell counts in the melanoma patient group. 
Considering the above, the combination of CMCs and the immunological status of 
the patient, as defined by the prevalence of selected immune cell types, seems 
to be a promising approach in melanoma diagnostics and prognostics.","DOI: 10.3390/cells12060856

cytokines, including IFN-γ. The involvement and mechanisms of γδ T cells in the 
pathogenesis of OLP remain obscure. The expression of γδ T cells in lesion 
tissues and in the peripheral blood of OLP patients was determined via flow 
cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Human leukocyte antigen-DR 
(HLA-DR), cluster of differentiation (CD) 69, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 
natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) and IFN-γ were detected in γδ T cells 
of OLP patients using flow cytometry. Additionally, the involvement of 
stimulator of the interferon genes (STING)-TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) pathway

was employed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of γδ T cells in OLP. γδ T 
cells were significantly upregulated in the lesion tissues, whereas their 
peripheral counterparts were downregulated in OLP patients. Meanwhile, increased 
frequencies of local CD69+ and NKG2D+ γδ T cells and peripheral HLA-DR+ and 
TLR4+ γδ T cells were detected in OLP. Furthermore, significant co-localization 
of STING and TBK1 was observed in the γδ T cells of OLP lesions. In addition,

syndrome of limbic encephalitis is herpes simplex virus (HSV), but rare cases 
caused by Treponema pallidum have also been reported. We present the case of a 
46-year-old man who presented with sudden onset of headaches, nausea, vomiting, 
and short-term loss of consciousness with clonic convulsions and subsequent 
disorientation and aphasia. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis and magnetic resonance of the brain revealed 
bilateral temporal lesions. Clinical, radiologic, and biochemical examinations 
of CSF suggested encephalitis caused by HSV. However, the positivity of CXCL-13 
chemokine in the CSF by a rapid point-of-care assay suggested active spirochetal 
infection and led to further serologic investigation. The definitive diagnosis 
of neuro-syphilis was concluded by positive intrathecal synthesis of 
immunoglobulins against Treponema pallidum. Penicillin therapy led to a rapid 
improvement, and the patient was discharged home after three weeks. Due to 
memory problems and irritability, after eighteen months, he came for a follow-up 
neurological and psychological examination. The psychological examination 
revealed a significant deficit in executive functions and behavioural changes.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has been shown to have some 
therapeutic effects in rodent models and patients with IBD; however, its role in 
colon tumor models is controversial. In this study, the potential role and 
mechanisms of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) in colitis-associated colon 
cancer (CAC) were investigated.
METHODS: The CAC mouse model was established with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran 
sulfate sodium (DSS). The mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of 
MSCs once weekly for different periods. The progression of CAC and the cytokine 
expression in tissues was assessed. Immunofluorescence staining was used to 
detect MSCs localization. Levels of immune cells in the spleen and lamina 
propria of the colon were detected using flow cytometry. A co-culture of MSCs 
and naïve T cells was performed to determine the effect of MSCs on naïve T cell 
differentiation.
RESULTS: Early administration of MSCs inhibited the occurrence of CAC, while 
late administration promoted the progression of CAC. The inhibitory effect of 
early injection in mice was characterized by the expression of inflammatory 
cytokines in colon tissue was decreased, and induction of T regulatory cells 
(Tregs) infiltration via TGF-β. The promotive effect of late injection was 
characterized by a shift of T helper (Th) 1/Th2 immune balance toward a Th2 
phenotype through IL-4 secretion. IL-12 can reverse this shift to Th2 
accumulation in mice.
CONCLUSION: MSCs can curb the progression of colon cancer by inducing Treg 
accumulation via TGF-β at the early stage of inflammatory transformation but 
promote the progression of colon cancer by inducing a shift in Th1/Th2 immune 
balance to Th2 through IL-4 secretion at the late stage. And the immune balance 
of Th1/Th2 influenced by MSCs could be reversed by IL-12.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-023-04028-3

monocyte distribution width (MDW) is a novel inflammatory biomarker with 
prognostic significance for coronavirus disease and pancreatitis; however, no 
study has assessed its correlation with the severity of colonic diverticulitis.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included patients older 
than 18 years who presented to the emergency department between November 1, 
2020, and May 31, 2021, and received a diagnosis of acute colonic diverticulitis 
after abdominal computed tomography. The characteristics and laboratory 
parameters of patients with simple versus complicated diverticulitis were 
compared. The significance of categorical data was assessed using the chi-square 
or Fisher's exact test. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous 
variables. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify 
predictors of complicated colonic diverticulitis. Receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curves were used to test the efficacy of inflammatory 
biomarkers in distinguishing simple from complicated cases.
RESULTS: Of the 160 patients enrolled, 21 (13.125%) had complicated 
diverticulitis. Although right-sided was more prevalent than left-sided colonic 
diverticulitis (70% versus 30%), complicated diverticulitis was more common in 
those with left-sided colonic diverticulitis (61.905%, p = 0.001). Age, white 
blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
MDW were significantly higher in the complicated diverticulitis group 
(p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the left-sided location 
and the MDW were significant and independent predictors of complicated 
diverticulitis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was as follows: MDW, 0.870 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.784-0.956); CRP, 0.800 (95% CI, 0.707-0.892); 
NLR, 0.724 (95% CI, 0.616-0.832); PLR, 0.662 (95% CI, 0.525-0.798); and WBC, 
0.679 (95% CI, 0.563-0.795). When the MDW cutoff was 20.38, the sensitivity and 
specificity were maximized to 90.5% and 80.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A large MDW was a significant and independent predictor of 
complicated diverticulitis. The optimal cutoff value for MDW is 20.38 as it 
exhibits maximum sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing between simple 
and complicated diverticulitis The MDW may aid in planning antibiotic therapy

METHODS: Data of two prospective multicenter studies in Switzerland were used,

RESULTS: Of the 389 children included 25 (6.4%) had TB disease, 12 (3.1%) TB 
infection, 28 (7.2%) were healthy TB exposed and 324 (83.3%) nTB-LRTI. Median 
(IQR) NLR was highest with 2.0 (1.2, 2.2) in children with TB disease compared 
to TB exposed [0.8 (0.6, 1.3); P = 0.002] and nTB-LRTI [0.3 (0.1, 1.0); P < 
0.001]. Median (IQR) NMLR was highest with 1.4 (1.2, 1.7) in children with TB 
disease compared to healthy exposed [0.7 (0.6, 1.1); P = 0.003] and children 
with nTB-LRTI [0.2 (0.1, 0.6); P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic 
curves to detect TB disease compared to nTB-LRTI for NLR and NMLR had an area 
under the curve of 0.82 and 0.86, the sensitivity of 88% and 88%, and 
specificity of 71% and 76%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: NLR and NMLR are promising, easy-to-obtain diagnostic biomarkers to 
differentiate children with TB disease from other lower respiratory tract 
infections. These results require validation in a larger study and in settings

D-dimer with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could improve the 
discriminative performance for aortic dissection (AD).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline levels of D-dimer and NLR were measured in 
patients suspected of AD. The diagnostic performance and clinical usefulness of 
D-dimer, NLR, and their combination were assessed and compared using receiver 
operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, logistic regression analysis, 
net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement 
(IDI), and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The levels of D-dimer and NLR were both significantly higher in AD 
patients. The combined use displayed good discriminatory performance with an 
area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.869, which was preferable to that of D-dimer. 
Although no meaningful improvement was found in the AUC by comparison with NLR 
alone, the combined use could significantly improve the discrimination power 
with a continuous NRI of 60.0% and an IDI of 4.9%. DCA demonstrated that the net 
benefit of the combined use was preferred over that of either single test.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of D-dimer and NLR could improve the 
discriminatory efficiency for AD with the potential in clinical application. 
This study may provide a novel diagnostic strategy for AD. More studies need to 
be done to confirm the findings of this study.","DOI: 10.1080/14737159.2023.2196406

characterized by abnormal activation of the immune system, causing 
hemophagocytosis, inflammation, and potentially widespread organ damage. The 
primary (genetic) form, caused by mutations affecting lymphocyte cytotoxicity, 
is most commonly seen in children. Secondary HLH is commonly associated with 
infections, malignancies, and rheumatologic disorders. Most current information 
on diagnosis and treatment is based on pediatric populations. HLH is a disease 
that should be diagnosed and treated promptly, otherwise it is fatal. Treatment 
is directed at treating the triggering disorder, along with symptomatic 
treatment with dexamethasone and etoposide. We present a 56-year-old patient who 
was admitted with worsening weakness, exertional dyspnea, dry and nonproductive 
cough, and a 5-pound weight loss associated with loss of appetite. This is among 
the rare disorders that are not commonly encountered in day-to-day practice. Our 
differential diagnoses were broad, including infection, such as visceral 
leishmaniasis, atypical/tuberculous mycobacteria, histoplasmosis, Ehrlichia, 
Bartonella, Brucella, Adenovirus, disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV), 
hematological-like Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or multicentric Castleman 
disease; drug reaction, such as drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS); and metabolic disorder, including Wolman's disease (infantile 
lysosomal acid lipase deficiency) or Gaucher's disease. Based on our 
investigations as described in our case report, it was narrowed down to 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and COVID-19. Two COVID-19 tests were 
negative. His lab abnormalities and diagnostic testing revealed hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis. He was empirically started on antibiotics and 
dexamethasone, to be continued for 2 weeks then tapered if the patient showed 
continued improvement. Dexamethasone was tapered over 8 weeks. He improved on 
just one of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications, proving 
that treatment should be tailored to the patient. In addition, in this case 
study, we included the background, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, 
management, and prognosis of HLH.","DOI: 10.3390/curroncol30030268

implications in the response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Thus, we 
aimed to exploratively analyze tumor tissue of HCC patients who do or do not 
respond to TACE, and to identify novel prognostic biomarkers predictive of 
response to TACE. We retrospectively included 15 HCC patients who had three 
consecutive TACE between January 2019 and November 2019. Eight patients had a 
response while seven patients had no response to TACE. All patients had 
measurable disease according to mRECIST. Corresponding tumor tissue samples were 
processed for differential expression profiling using NanoString nCounter® 
PanCancer immune profiling panel. Immune-related pathways were broadly 
upregulated in TACE responders. The top differentially regulated genes were the 
upregulated CXCL1 (log2fc 4.98, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-p < 0.001), CXCL6 
(log2fc 4.43, BH-p = 0.016) and the downregulated MME (log2fc -4.33, BH-p 
0.001). CD8/T-regs was highly increased in responders, whereas the relative 
number of T-regs to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) was highly decreased. 
We preliminary identified CXCL1 and CXCL6 as candidate genes that might have the 
potential to serve as therapeutically relevant biomarkers in HCC patients. This 
might pave the way to improve patient selection for TACE in HCC patients beyond

immunogenic malignancies expressing melanoma-differentiation antigens and 
neoantigens. SRY-related HMG-box 10 (SOX10) is a transcription factor and a 
neural-crest differentiation marker that is used as a diagnostic marker for 
melanoma whilst playing a role in melanoma initiation through activation of the 
SOX10-MITF axis. SOX10 was shown to play a role in melanoma initiation by 
inducing expression of immune checkpoint molecules (e.g., HVEM and CEACAM1). In 
this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between SOX10 and the 
expression an immune checkpoint molecule, programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SOX10 overexpression and knockdown was performed using 
SOX10 gene transfection and SOX10 siRNA transfection into A375 melanoma cells. 
PD-L1 expression was assessed by flow cytometry and western blotting. T cell 
response was evaluated using NY-ESO-1 specific TCR-transduced T (TCR-T) cells by 
IFNγ ELISPOT assay.
RESULTS: SOX10 overexpression increased the expression of PD-L1, whereas SOX10 
knockdown, using siRNA, decreased its expression. IFNγ ELISPOT assay revealed 
that overexpression of SOX10 decreased the susceptibility of cells to 
NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T cells.
CONCLUSION: SOX10 has a role in the intrinsic immune suppressive mechanisms of 
melanoma through expression of PD-L1.","Copyright © 2023 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

with a down-regulated class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression can lead 
to proliferation unhampered by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which has been proven to 
be of prognostic relevance. The objective of this study was to determine the 
levels of HLA-A and HLA-B/C expression in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) cells 
and their usefulness for predicting 5-year survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective double-blinded cohort study analyzed 
patients starting a new line of therapy for MBC. RT-qPCR was used to determine 
the levels of HLA-A and B/C expression in MBC cells and the mRNA-based tumor 
intrinsic subtype. Two receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were 
constructed in order to determine whether HLA-A and HLA-B/C expression levels 
can be used for predicting 5-year survival. Youden J points, and sensitivity and 
specificity optimized cut-off points were determined for both ROC curves.
RESULTS: We enrolled 34 patients. The ROC curve for HLA-B/C had the highest AUC 
compared to HLA-A (0.55 vs. 0.42). High levels of HLA-A and HLA-B/C expression 
(40-ΔΔCT of 33.5 and 31.9, respectively) were highly specific (reaching 87.5% 
for HLA-A and even 100% specificity for HLA-B/C) yet insensitive for five-year 
survival in our study.
CONCLUSION: High expression of certain class I HLA molecule subtypes by MBCs, in 
particular high HLA-A or B/C expression by MBC cells seems very specific in 
predicting the 5-year survival. We determined cut-off values for these HLA 
molecule clusters with high specificity, which might help identify patients with 
a favorable prognosis as prognosticators of a 5-year overall survival if their 
sensitivity is improved in larger prospective cohorts.","Copyright © 2023 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Both the crystalline and soluble forms of cholesterol increase 
macrophage secretion of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), aggravating the inflammatory 
response in atherosclerosis (AS). However, the link between cholesterol and 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the 
effect of cholesterol treatment on Tregs.
METHODS: Differentiation of induced Tregs (iTregs) was analyzed using flow 
cytometry. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and its target 
genes was measured by western blotting and/or RT-qPCR. Two reporter jurkat cell 
lines were constructed by lentiviral transfection. Mitochondrial function and 
the structure of natural Tregs (nTregs) were determined by tetramethylrhodamine 
(TMRM) and mitoSOX staining, Seahorse assay, and electron microscopy. The 
immunoregulatory function of nTregs was determined by nTreg-macrophage 
co-culture assay and ELISA.
RESULTS: Cholesterol treatment suppressed iTreg differentiation and impaired 
nTreg function. Mechanistically, cholesterol induced the production of 
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in naïve T cells, inhibiting the 
degradation of HIF-1α and unleashing its inhibitory effects on iTreg 
differentiation. Furthermore, cholesterol-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage 
impaired the immunosuppressive function of nTregs. Mixed lymphocyte reaction and 
nTreg-macrophage co-culture assays revealed that cholesterol treatment 
compromised the ability of nTregs to inhibit pro-inflammatory conventional T 
cell proliferation and promote the anti-inflammatory functions of macrophages. 
Finally, mitoTEMPO (MT), a specific mtROS scavenger, restored iTreg 
differentiation and protected nTreg from further deterioration.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cholesterol may aggravate inflammation 
within AS plaques by acting on both iTregs and nTregs, and that MT may be a 
promising anti-atherogenic drug.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-023-03896-z

from indolent to rapidly progressive disease. Leukemic cell subsets with 
regulatory properties evade immune clearance; however, the contribution of such 
subsets during CLL progression is not completely elucidated. Here, we report 
that CLL B cells crosstalk with their immune counterparts, notably by promoting 
the regulatory T (Treg) cell compartment and shaping several helper T (Th) 
subsets. Among various constitutively- and BCR/CD40-mediated factors secreted, 
tumour subsets co-express two important immunoregulatory cytokines, IL10 and 
TGFβ1, both associated with a memory B cell phenotype. Neutralizing secreted 
IL10 or inhibiting the TGFβ signalling pathway demonstrated that these cytokines 
are mainly involved in Th- and Treg differentiation/maintenance. In line with 
the regulatory subsets, we also demonstrated that a CLL B cell population 
expresses FOXP3, a marker of regulatory T cells. Analysis of IL10, TGFβ1 and 
FOXP3 positive subpopulations frequencies in CLL samples discriminated 2

lead to primary Sjögren' s syndrome (pSS).
METHODS: We downloaded datasets about peripheral blood samples of pSS patients 
and healthy controls (GSE51092, GSE84844, and GSE66795) from Gene Expression 
Omnibus database. The weighted co-expression network analysis and differential 
expression analysis first were implemented. After that, protein-protein network 
interaction and Support Vector Machines were applied in the meantime to take 
intersection for key genes. Moreover, we conducted immune cell infiltration 
analysis to explore the relationship between the gene expression and 
concentration of immune cells in peripheral blood. Lastly, the expression of key 
genes was verified in pSS patients and murine models by reverse-transcription 
polymerase chain reaction. Meanwhile, correlation analysis of gene expression 
and disease activity was also performed.
RESULTS: Only 1 key gene, interferon induced with helicase c domain 1 (IFIH1), 
was identified to be both significantly up-regulated and important for the 
diagnosis of pSS. The increased expression of IFIH1 in peripheral blood was 
confirmed in data sets, patients and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Its 
expression was correlated with disease activity in patients as well. In 
addition, the IFIH1 expression was also increased in spleen and salivary glands 
infiltrated with lymphocytes in NOD mice. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration 
analysis showed that the expression of IFIH1 was positively correlated with the 
proportion of memory B cells and activated dendritic cells, and negatively 
correlated with the proportion of macrophage M0.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, bioinformatics analyses and experimental assays were 
performed to provide a new insight for understanding of pSS. IFIH1 may be a new 
diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for pSS.","© 2023 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley &

transplantation and autoimmunity. In conventional T cell therapy, chronic 
stimulation can result in poor in vivo function, a phenomenon termed exhaustion. 
Whether or not Tregs are also susceptible to exhaustion, and if so, if this 
would limit their therapeutic effect, was unknown. To ""benchmark"" exhaustion in 
human Tregs, we used a method known to induce exhaustion in conventional T 
cells: expression of a tonic-signaling chimeric antigen receptor (TS-CAR). We 
found that TS-CAR-expressing Tregs rapidly acquired a phenotype that resembled 
exhaustion and had major changes in their transcriptome, metabolism, and 
epigenome. Similar to conventional T cells, TS-CAR Tregs upregulated expression 
of inhibitory receptors and transcription factors such as PD-1, TIM3, TOX and 
BLIMP1, and displayed a global increase in chromatin accessibility-enriched AP-1 
family transcription factor binding sites. However, they also displayed 
Treg-specific changes such as high expression of 4-1BB, LAP, and GARP. DNA 
methylation analysis and comparison to a CD8+ T cell-based multipotency index 
showed that Tregs naturally exist in a relatively differentiated state, with 
further TS-CAR-induced changes. Functionally, TS-CAR Tregs remained stable and 
suppressive in vitro but were nonfunctional in vivo, as tested in a model of 
xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. These data are the first comprehensive 
investigation of exhaustion in Tregs and reveal key similarities and differences 
with exhausted conventional T cells. The finding that human Tregs are 
susceptible to chronic stimulation-driven dysfunction has important implications 
for the design of CAR Treg adoptive immunotherapy strategies.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2219086120

oocyte/spermatozoa contacts during fertilization. Intriguingly, it is also 
expressed in CD4+ T lymphocytes, in particular Treg cells under the control of 
Foxp3. To understand Izumo1R function in Treg cells, we analyzed mice with 
Treg-specific Izumo1r deficiency (Iz1rTrKO). Treg differentiation and 
homeostasis were largely normal, with no overt autoimmunity and only marginal 
increases in PD1+ and CD44hi Treg phenotypes. pTreg differentiation was also 
unaffected. Iz1rTrKO mice proved uniquely susceptible to imiquimod-induced, γδT 
cell-dependent, skin disease, contrasting with normal responses to several 
inflammatory or tumor challenges, including other models of skin inflammation. 
Analysis of Iz1rTrKO skin revealed a subclinical inflammation that presaged 
IMQ-induced changes, with an imbalance of Rorγ+ γδT cells. Immunostaining of 
normal mouse skin revealed the expression of Izumo1, the ligand for Izumo1R, 
electively in dermal γδT cells. We propose that Izumo1R on Tregs enables tight 
contacts with γδT cells, thereby controlling a particular path of skin 
inflammation.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2221255120

Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China. ccmok2005@yahoo.com.","Despite the uncertainty of the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, 
novel small molecules targeting specific intracellular mechanisms of immune 
cells are being developed to reverse the pathophysiological processes. These 
targeted molecules have the advantages of convenient administration, lower 
production costs, and the lack of immunogenicity. The Janus kinases, Bruton's 
tyrosine kinases, and spleen tyrosine kinases are important enzymes for 
activating downstream signals from various receptors on immune cells that 
include cytokines, growth factor, hormones, Fc, CD40, and B-cell receptors. 
Suppression of these kinases impairs cellular activation, differentiation, and 
survival, leading to diminished cytokine actions and autoantibody secretion. 
Intracellular protein degradation by immunoproteasomes, levered by the cereblon 
E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is an essential process for the regulation of 
cellular functions and survival. Modulation of the immunoproteasomes and 
cereblon leads to depletion of long-lived plasma cells, reduced plasmablast 
differentiation, and production of autoantibodies and interferon-α. The 
sphingosine 1-phosphate/sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 pathway is 
responsible for lymphocyte trafficking, regulatory T-cell/Th17 cell homeostasis, 
and vascular permeability. Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 modulators limit 
the trafficking of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood-brain barrier, 
increase regulatory T-cell function, and decrease production of autoantibodies 
and type I interferons. This article summarizes the development of these 
targeted small molecules in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
the future prospect for precision medicine.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland

that levels of T-cell activation and the size of the HIV reservoir are greater 
in rectal tissue and lymph nodes (LN) than in blood, the relative contributions 
of T-cell subsets to this anatomic difference are unknown. We measured and 
compared HIV-1 DNA content, expression of the T-cell activation markers CD38 and 
HLA-DR, and expression of the exhaustion markers programmed cell death protein 1 
(PD-1) and T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor

transitional memory (TM), and effector memory (EM) CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in 
paired blood and LN samples among 14 people with HIV who were receiving 
antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1 DNA levels, T-cell immune activation, and TIGIT 
expression were higher in LN than in blood, especially in CM and TM CD4+ T-cell 
subsets. Immune activation was significantly higher in all CD8+ T-cell subsets, 
and memory CD8+ T-cell subsets from LN had higher levels of PD-1 expression, 
compared with blood, while TIGIT expression levels were significantly lower in 
TM CD8+ T-cells. The differences seen in CM and TM CD4+ T-cell subsets were more 
pronounced among participants with CD4+ T-cell counts of <500 cells/μL within

a range of symptoms in which host immune response have been associated with 
disease progression. However, the putative role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in 
determining COVID-19 outcomes has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we 
compared peripheral Tregs between volunteers not previously infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 (healthy control [HC]) and volunteers who recovered from mild (Mild 
Recovered) and severe (Severe Recovered) COVID-19. Peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 synthetic peptides (Pool Spike 
CoV-2 and Pool CoV-2) or staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). Results of a 
multicolor flow cytometric assay showed higher Treg frequency and expression of 
IL-10, IL-17, perforin, granzyme B, PD-1, and CD39/CD73 co-expression in Treg 
among the PBMC from the Mild Recovered group than in the Severe Recovered or HC 
groups for certain SARS-CoV-2 related stimulus. Moreover, Mild Recovered 
unstimulated samples presented a higher Tregs frequency and expression of IL-10 
and granzyme B than did that of HC. Compared with Pool CoV-2 stimuli, Pool Spike 
CoV-2 reduced IL-10 expression and improved PD-1 expression in Tregs from 
volunteers in the Mild Recovered group. Interestingly, Pool Spike CoV-2 elicited 
a decrease in Treg IL-17+ frequency in the Severe Recovered group. In HC, the 
expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP) and cytotoxic granule 
co-expression by Tregs was higher in Pool CoV-2 stimulated samples. While Pool 
Spike CoV-2 stimulation reduced the frequency of IL-10+ and CTLA-4+ Tregs in 
PBMC from volunteers in the Mild Recovered group who had not experienced certain 
symptoms, higher levels of perforin and perforin+granzyme B+ co-expression by 
Tregs were found in the Mild Recovered group in volunteers who had experienced 
dyspnea. Finally, we found differential expression of CD39 and CD73 among 
volunteers in the Mild Recovered group between those who had and had not 
experienced musculoskeletal pain. Collectively, our study suggests that changes 
in the immunosuppressive repertoire of Tregs can influence the development of a 
distinct COVID-19 clinical profile, revealing that a possible modulation of 
Tregs exists among volunteers of the Mild Recovered group between those who did 
and did not develop certain symptoms, leading to mild disease.","Copyright © 2023 de Sousa Palmeira, Peixoto, Csordas, de Medeiros, de Azevedo,

differentiation-related genes (DRGs) in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from GEO and bulk RNA-seq data 
from TCGA were analyzed to identify DRGs using trajectory method. Functional 
gene analysis was carried out by GO/KEGG enrichment analysis. The mRNA and 
protein expression in human tissue were analyzed by HPA and GEPIA databases. To 
investigate the prognostic value of these genes, three risk score (RS) models in 
different pathological types of NSCLC were generated and predicted NSCLC 
prognosis in datasets from TCGA, UCSC and GEO databases.
RESULTS: 1,738 DRGs were identified through trajectory analysis. GO/KEGG 
analysis showed that these genes were predominantly related to myeloid leukocyte 
activation and leukocyte migration. 13 DRGs (C1QB, CCL4, CD14, CD84, FGL2, 
MS4A6A, NLRP3, PLEK, RNASE6, SAMSN1, SPN, TMEM176B, ZEB2) related to prognosis 
were obtained through univariate Cox analysis and Lasso regression. C1QB, CD84, 
FGL2, MS4A6A, NLRP3, PLEK, SAMSN1, SPN, and ZEB2 were downregulated in NSCLC 
compared to non-cancer tissue. The mRNA of 13 genes were significantly expressed 
in pulmonary macrophages with strong cell specificity. Meanwhile, 
immunohistochemical staining showed that C1QB, CCL4, SPN, CD14, NLRP3, SAMSN1, 
MS4A6A, TMEM176B were expressed in different degrees in lung cancer tissues. 
ZEB2 (HR=1.4, P<0.05) and CD14 (HR=1.6, P<0.05) expression were associated with 
a worse prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma; ZEB2 (HR=0.64, P<0.05), CD84 
(HR=0.65, P<0.05), PLEK (HR=0.71, P<0.05) and FGL2 (HR=0.61, P<0.05) expression 
were associated with a better prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Three RS models 
based on 13 DRGs both showed that the high RS was significantly associated with 
poor prognosis in different pathological types of NSCLC.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prognostic value of DRGs in TAMs in NSCLC 
patients, providing novel insights for the development of therapeutic and 
prognostic targets based on TAM functional differences.","Copyright © 2023 Li, Zhou, Zhu, Yang, Jin, Dai, Zhu, Song and Jiang.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1123840

responses, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are critically regulated by the 
transcription factor retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t 
(RORγt). Previously, we have identified a crucial role of the conserved 
non-coding sequence 9 (CNS9), located at +5,802 to +7,963 bp of the Rorc gene, 
in directing T helper 17 differentiation and related autoimmune disease. 
However, whether cis-acting elements regulate RORγt expression in ILC3s is 
unknown.
RESULTS: Here we show that CNS9 deficiency in mice not only decreases ILC3 
signature gene expression and increases ILC1-gene expression features in total 
ILC3s, but also leads to generation of a distinct CD4+NKp46+ ILC3 population, 
though the overall numbers and frequencies of RORγt+ ILC3s are not affected. 
Mechanistically, CNS9 deficiency selectively decreases RORγt expression in 
ILC3s, which thus alters ILC3 gene expression features and promotes 
cell-intrinsic generation of CD4+NKp46+ ILC3 subset.
CONCLUSION: Our study thus identifies CNS9 as an essential cis-regulatory 
element controlling the lineage stability and plasticity of ILC3s through 
modulating expression levels of RORγt protein.","Copyright © 2023 Chang, Zhang, Ge, Xing, Guo, Wang and Dong.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1105145

modulate myeloid cells and T cell function to control systemic autoimmunity. 
Contrary to our hypothesis, the deficiency of Nlrp12 in autoimmune-prone 
B6.Faslpr/lpr mice ameliorated autoimmunity in males but not females. Nlrp12 
deficiency dampened B cell terminal differentiation, germinal center reaction, 
and survival of autoreactive B cells leading to decreased production of 
autoantibodies and reduced renal deposition of IgG and complement C3. In 
parallel, Nlrp12 deficiency reduced the expansion of potentially pathogenic T 
cells, including double-negative T cells and T follicular helper cells. 
Furthermore, reduced pro-inflammatory innate immunity was observed, where the 
gene deletion decreased in-vivo expansion of splenic macrophages and mitigated 
ex-vivo responses of bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells to LPS 
stimulation. Interestingly, Nlrp12 deficiency altered the diversity and 
composition of fecal microbiota in both male and female B6/lpr mice. Notably, 
however, Nlrp12 deficiency significantly modulated small intestinal microbiota 
only in male mice, suggesting that the sex differences in disease phenotype 
might be gut microbiota-dependent. Together, these results suggest a potential 
pathogenic role of NLRP12 in promoting systemic autoimmunity in males. Future 
studies will investigate sex-based mechanisms through which NLRP12 
differentially modulates autoimmune outcomes.","Copyright © 2023 Abdelhamid, Mao, Cabana-Puig, Zhu, Swartwout, Edwards,

transfusions, which can have major immunomodulatory effects. Platelet 
concentrates (PCs) contain many immunomodulatory elements, including the 
platelets themselves, residual leukocytes, extracellular vesicles, such as 
microparticles (MPs), cytokines and other soluble elements. Two of these 
components, MPs and a soluble form of CD27 (sCD27), have been shown to play a 
particularly important role in immune system modulation. The loss of CD27 
expression is an irreversible marker of terminal effector CD3+ T-lymphocyte (TL) 
differentiation, and the CD27+ MPs present in PCs may maintain CD27 expression 
on the surface of TLs, and, thus, the activation of these cells.
METHODS: In this study, we phenotyped the CD27-expressing MPs present in PCs by 
microscale flow cytometry and investigated the interaction of these particles 
with CD4+ TLs. We cocultured MPs and PBMCs and determined the origin of the CD27 
expressed on the surface of CD4+ TLs with the aid of two fluorochromes (BV510 
for CD27 originating from MPs and BV786 for cellular CD27).
RESULTS: We showed that the binding of CD27- expressing MPs involved the CD70 
molecule, which was also present on these MPs. Finally, the maintenance of CD27 
expression on the surface of TLs by sorted CD27+ MPs led to activation levels 
lower than those observed with other types of MPs.
DISCUSSION: These results for CD27-expressing MPs and their CD70-mediated 
targeting open up new possibilities for immunotherapy based on the use of MPs to 
maintain a phenotype or to target immune cells, for example. Moreover, 
decreasing the levels of CD27-expressing MPs in transfused platelets might also 
increase the chances of success for anti-CD27 monoclonal immunotherapy.","Copyright © 2023 Cagnet, Neyrinck-Leglantier, Tamagne, Berradhia, Khelfa,

between these and additional transcription factors such as STATs, Batf, Ikaros, 
Runx3, c-Maf, Bcl11b, and Zbtb46, activated in response to lineage-guiding

loss. Protocol biopsy poses additional risk for recipients with normal renal 
function. The transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
contains tremendous information and has potential application value for 
non-invasive diagnosis.
METHODS: From the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we collected three datasets 
containing 109 rejected samples and 215 normal controls. After data filter and 
normalization, we performed deconvolution of bulk RNA sequencing data to predict 
cell type and cell-type specific gene expression. Subsequently, we calculated 
cell communication analysis by Tensor-cell2cell and conducted the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to screen the 
robust differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These gene expression levels were 
validated in mice kidney transplantation acute rejection model. The function of 
the novel gene ISG15 in monocytes was further confirmed by gene knockdown and 
lymphocyte-stimulated assay.
RESULTS: The bulk RNA-seq hardly predicted kidney transplant rejection 
accurately. Seven types of immune cells and transcriptomic characteristics were 
predicted from the gene expression data. The monocytes showed significant 
differences in amount and gene expression of rejection. The cell-to-cell 
communication indicated the enrichment of antigen presentation and T cell 
activation ligand-receptor pairs. Then 10 robust genes were found by Lasso 
regression and a novel gene ISG15 remained differential expression in monocytes 
between rejection samples and normal control both in public data and animal 
model. Furthermore, ISG15 also showed a critical role in promoting the 
proliferation of T cells.
CONCLUSION: This study identified and validated a novel gene ISG15 associated 
with rejection in peripheral blood after kidney transplantation, which is a 
significant non-invasive diagnosis and a potential therapeutic target.","Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Qin, Wang, Li and Hu.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1153940

mitosis, is a hallmark of human cancers that contributes to tumor heterogeneity 
and has been implicated in driving metastasis and altering responses to therapy. 
Though multiple mechanisms can produce CIN, lagging chromosomes generated from 
abnormal merotelic attachments are the major cause of CIN in a variety of cell 
lines, and are expected to predominate in cancer. Here, we quantify CIN in 
breast cancer using a tumor microarray, matched primary and metastatic samples, 
and patient-derived organoids from primary breast cancer. Surprisingly, 
misaligned chromosomes are more common than lagging chromosomes and represent a 
major source of CIN in primary and metastatic tumors. This feature of breast 
cancers is conserved in a majority of breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, 
though a portion of misaligned chromosomes align before anaphase onset, the 
fraction that remain represents the largest source of CIN in these cells. 
Metastatic breast cancers exhibit higher rates of CIN than matched primary 
cancers, primarily due to increases in misaligned chromosomes. Whether CIN 
causes immune activation or evasion is controversial. We find that misaligned 
chromosomes result in immune-activating micronuclei substantially less 
frequently than lagging and bridge chromosomes and that breast cancers with 
greater frequencies of lagging chromosomes and chromosome bridges recruit more 
stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These data indicate misaligned 
chromosomes represent a major mechanism of CIN in breast cancer and provide 
support for differential immunostimulatory effects of specific types of CIN.
SIGNIFICANCE: We surveyed the single-cell landscape of mitotic defects that 
generate CIN in primary and metastatic breast cancer and relevant models.

chromosome segregation errors.",© 2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-22-0302

memory T cells, of which resident memory T (TRM) cells reside permanently in 
organ tissues. Involvement of TRM cells has been indicated in pathological 
conditions of various skin diseases. CD122, which is the β chain subunit of 
interleukin (IL)- 2 and IL-15 receptors, is expressed on immune cells including 
TRM cells.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CD122 signaling in skin CD8+ TRM cells 
mediates the development of mucocutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
METHODS: We used a genetically modified mouse expressing a membrane-bound form 
of chicken ovalbumin (OVA) under the control of the keratin 14 promoter, which 
develops GVHD-like erosive mucocutaneous disease resulting in sclerodermatous 
disease after transfer of OVA-specific T cell-receptor-transgenic CD8+ OT-I 
cells. Mice with mucocutaneous GVHD were treated with an anti-CD122 blocking 
antibody.
RESULTS: Administration of an anti-CD122 blocking antibody suppresses the 
development of acute/chronic GVHD-like mucocutaneous disease in our murine model 
via the reduction of CD122-expressing memory CD8+ T cells, including skin, 
memory autoaggressive CD8+ T cells. Moreover, blockade of CD122, even after the 
establishment of acute GVHD, inhibited the development of chronic GVHD-like 
sclerodermatous disease via the reduction of epidermal and dermal TRM 
autoaggressive CD8+ T cells.
CONCLUSION: Skin memory CD8+ T cells in particular mediate the development of 
mucocutaneous GVHD, and blockade of CD122 may be an effective treatment 
strategy, especially for sclerodermatous GVHD.","Copyright © 2023 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology. Published by

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: T cell activation and programming from their naïve/resting state, 
characterized by widespread modifications in chromatin accessibility triggering 
extensive changes in transcriptional programs, is orchestrated by several 
cytokines and transcription regulators. PRDM1 and PRDM2 encode for proteins with 
PR/SET and zinc finger domains that control several biological processes, 
including cell differentiation, through epigenetic regulation of gene 
expression. Different transcripts leading to main protein isoforms with (PR +) 
or without (PR-) the PR/SET domain have been described. Although many studies 
have established the critical PRDM1 role in hematopoietic cell differentiation, 
maintenance and/or function, the single transcript contribution has not been 
investigated before. Otherwise, very few evidence is currently available on 
PRDM2. Here, we aimed to analyze the role of PRDM1 and PRDM2 different 
transcripts as mediators of T lymphocyte activation.
METHODS: We analyzed the transcription signature of the main variants from PRDM1 
(BLIMP1a and BLIMP1b) and PRDM2 (RIZ1 and RIZ2) genes, in human T lymphocytes 
and Jurkat cells overexpressing PRDM2 cDNAs following activation through 
different signals.
RESULTS: T lymphocyte activation induced an early increase of RIZ2 and RIZ1 
followed by BLIMP1b increase and finally by BLIMP1a increase. The ""first"" and 
the ""second"" signals shifted the balance towards the PR- forms for both genes. 
Interestingly, the PI3K signaling pathway modulated the RIZ1/RIZ2 ratio in favor 
of RIZ1 while the balance versus RIZ2 was promoted by MAPK pathway. Cytokines 
mediating different Jak/Stat signaling pathways (third signal) early modulated 
the expression of PRDM1 and PRDM2 and the relationship of their different 
transcripts confirming the early increase of the PR- transcripts. Different 
responses of T cell subpopulations were also observed. Jurkat cells showed that 
the acute transient RIZ2 increase promoted the balancing of PRDM1 forms towards 
BLIMP1b. The stable forced expression of RIZ1 or RIZ2 induced a significant 
variation in the expression of key transcription factors involved in T 
lymphocyte differentiation. The BLIMP1a/b balance shifted in favor of BLIMP1a in 
RIZ1-overexpressing cells and of BLIMP1b in RIZ2-overexpressing cells.

(#)Contributed equally","During intracellular infection, T follicular helper (TFH) and T helper 1 (TH1) 
cells promote humoral and cell-mediated responses, respectively. Another subset, 
CD4-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs), eliminate infected cells via functions 
typically associated with CD8+ T cells. The mechanisms underlying 
differentiation of these populations are incompletely understood. Here, we 
identify the transcription factor Aiolos as a reciprocal regulator of TFH and 
CD4-CTL programming. We find that Aiolos deficiency results in downregulation of 
key TFH transcription factors, and consequently reduced TFH differentiation and 
antibody production, during influenza virus infection. Conversely, CD4-CTL 
programming is elevated, including enhanced Eomes and cytolytic molecule 
expression. We further demonstrate that Aiolos deficiency allows for enhanced 
IL-2 sensitivity and increased STAT5 association with CD4-CTL gene targets, 
including Eomes, effector molecules, and IL2Ra. Thus, our collective findings 
identify Aiolos as a pivotal regulator of CD4-CTL and TFH programming and 
highlight its potential as a target for manipulating CD4+ T cell responses.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-37420-0

glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), and receptors. These 
lipid raft components are localized at the plasma membrane and are essential for 
signal transmission and organogenesis. However, few reports have been published 
on the specific effects of lipid rafts on tooth development. Using microarray 
and single-cell RNA sequencing methods, we found that a GPI-AP, lymphocyte 
antigen-6/Plaur domain-containing 1 (Lypd1), was specifically expressed in 
preodontoblasts. Depletion of Lypd1 in tooth germ using an ex vivo organ culture 
system and in mouse dental pulp (mDP) cells resulted in the inhibition of 
odontoblast differentiation. Activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 
signaling by BMP2 treatment in mDP cells promoted odontoblast differentiation 
via phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, while this BMP2-mediated odontoblast 
differentiation was inhibited by depletion of Lypd1. Furthermore, we created a 
deletion construct of the C terminus containing the omega site in LYPD1; this 
site is necessary for localizing GPI-APs to the plasma membrane and lipid rafts. 
We identified that this site is essential for odontoblast differentiation and 
morphological change of mDP cells. These findings demonstrated that LYPD1 is a 
novel marker of preodontoblasts in the developing tooth; in addition, they 
suggest that LYPD1 is important for tooth development and that it plays a 
pivotal role in odontoblast differentiation by regulating Smad1/5/8 
phosphorylation through its effect as a GPI-AP in lipid rafts.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jbc.2023.104638

(LPS)-induced TNF α, IL-1β and IL-6 by the THP-1 monocyte cell line. The 
determination of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression in Jurkat T 
cells revealed strong increases in ERK-2 kinase and p38α subunits. In WEHI 231 
immature B cells, TFX® elevated p38α, and had a particularly strong elevating 
effect on p38γ. In HL-60 myeloblastic cells, the expression of p38α, β and γ was 
not detectable, almost blocked for p38δ and JNK, but accompanied by an increase 
in ERK-1. In turn, the effects of TFX® in J744E macrophages resulted in a strong 
increase in p38γ expression, moderate elevations of ERK and a drop in p38δ. 
Significant increases in MAPK expression were also found in cells from the

fully mature into germinal center-T follicular helper (GC-TFH) cells and for the 
latter to mount a CD4 T cell-dependent humoral immune response. Although this 
interaction occurs in a B:T synapse-dependent manner, how CD4 T cells 
transcriptionally regulate B:T synapse formation remains largely unknown. Here, 
we report that Mef2d, an isoform of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2) 
transcription factor family, is a critical regulator of this process. In CD4 T 
cells, Mef2d negatively regulates expression of Sh2d1a, which encodes 
SLAM-associated protein (SAP), a critical regulator of B:T synapses. We found 
that Mef2d regulates Sh2d1a expression via DNA binding-dependent transcriptional 
repression, inhibiting SAP-dependent B:T synapse formation and preventing 
antigen-specific CD4 T cells from differentiating into GC-TFH cells. Mef2d also 
impeded IL-21 production by CD4 T cells, an important B cell help signaling 
molecule, via direct repression of the Il21 gene. In contrast, CD4 T 
cell-specific disruption of Mef2d led to a substantial increase in GC-TFH 
differentiation in response to protein immunization, concurrent with enhanced 
SAP expression. MEF2D mRNA expression inversely correlates with human systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient autoimmune parameters, including circulating 
TFH-like cell frequencies, autoantibodies, and SLEDAI scores. These findings 
highlight Mef2d as a pivotal rheostat in CD4 T cells for controlling GC 
formation and antibody production by B cells.","DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.adf2248

developmental stage-specific metabolism in mammals. The lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) isoenzyme spectrum reflects the tissue-specific metabolic status. We found 
that three tetrameric isoenzymes composed of LDHA and LDHB (LDH-3/4/5) comprise 
the LDH spectrum in T cells. Genetically deleting LDHA or LDHB altered the 
isoenzyme spectrum by removing all heterotetramers and leaving T cells with 
LDH-1 (the homotetramer of LDHB) or LDH-5 (the homotetramer of LDHA), 
respectively. Accordingly, deleting LDHA suppressed glycolysis, cell 
proliferation, and differentiation. Unexpectedly, deleting LDHB enhanced 
glycolysis but suppressed T cell differentiation, indicating that an optimal 
zone of glycolytic activity is required to maintain cell fitness. 
Mechanistically, the LDH isoenzyme spectrum imposed by LDHA and LDHB is 
necessary to optimize glycolysis to maintain a balanced nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen pool. Our results

Th1-like CD4 T cell response and that this effector program underlies its 
protective impact. Canonical Th1 polarization requires cytokine-mediated 
activation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT4 that synergize to 
maximize the induction of the ""master regulator"" Th1 transcription factor, 
T-bet. Here, we determine the individual requirements for these transcription 
factors in directing the Th1 imprint primed by influenza infection in mice by 
tracking virus-specific wild-type or T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells in which STAT1 
or STAT4 is knocked out. We find that STAT1 is required to protect 
influenza-primed CD4 T cells from NK cell-mediated deletion and for their 
expression of hallmark Th1 attributes. STAT1 is also required to prevent type I 
IFN signals from inhibiting the induction of the Th17 master regulator, Rorγt, 
in Th17-prone T-bet-/- cells responding to IAV. In contrast, STAT4 expression 
does not appreciably impact the phenotypic or functional attributes of wild-type 
or T-bet-/- CD4 T cell responses. However, cytokine-mediated STAT4 activation in 
virus-specific CD4 T cells enhances their Th1 identity in a T-bet-dependent 
manner, indicating that influenza infection does not promote maximal Th1 
induction. Finally, we show that the T-bet-dependent protective capacity of CD4 
T cell effectors against IAV is optimized by engaging both STAT1 and STAT4 
during Th1 priming, with important implications for vaccine strategies aiming to 
generate T cell immunity.","Copyright © 2023 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.2200407

leukemia (AML), the immunotherapeutic targeting exhausted T cells such as 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in AML failed to achieve 
satisfying efficacy. Characteristics of exhausted T cells in AML remained to be 
explored.
METHODS: Phenotypic analysis of T cells in bone marrow (BM) using flow cytometry 
combining senescent and exhausted markers was performed in de novo AML patients 
and healthy donors as well as AML patients with complete remission (CR). 
Functional analysis of T-cell subsets was also performed in de novo AML patients 
using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: T cells experienced a phenotypic shift to terminal differentiation 
characterized by increased loss of CD28 expression and decrease of naïve T 
cells. Additionally, lack of CD28 expression could help define a severely 
exhausted subset from generally exhausted T cells (PD-1+TIGIT+). Moreover, CD28- 
subsets rather than CD28+ subsets predominantly contributed to the significant 
accumulation of PD-1+TIGIT+ T cells in AML patients. Further comparison of de 
novo and CR AML patients showed that T-cell exhaustion status was improved after 
disease remission, especially in CD28+ subsets. Notably, higher frequency of 
CD28-TIGIT-CD4+ T cells correlated with the presence of minimal residual disease 
in AML-CR group. However, the correlation between CD28- exhausted T cells and 
cytogenetic risk or white blood cell count was not observed, except for that 
CD28- exhausted CD4+ T cells correlated with lymphocyte counts. Intriguingly, 
larger amount of CD28-TGITI+CD8+ T cells at diagnosis was associated with poor 
treatment response and shorter leukemia free survival.
DISCUSSION: In summary, lack of CD28 expression defined a severely exhausted 
status from exhausted T cells. Accumulation of CD28- exhausted T cells was 
linked to occurrence of AML, and correlated to poor clinical outcome. Our data 
might facilitate the development of combinatory strategies to improve the 
efficacy of PD-1 blockade in AML.","Copyright © 2023 Huang, Zheng, Zhu, Hong, Zha, Lin, Li, Wang, Fang, Yu, Liu and

multiple sclerosis (MS). Several disease modifying drugs including cladribine 
have been shown to exert differential effects on peripheral blood B cell 
subsets. However, little is known regarding functional changes within the 
peripheral B cell populations. In this study, we obtained a detailed picture of 
B cell repertoire changes under cladribine treatment on a combined 
immunoglobulin (Ig) transcriptome and proteome level.
METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing of Ig heavy chain (IGH) 
transcripts and Ig mass spectrometry in cladribine-treated patients with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (n = 8) at baseline and after 6 and 12 
months of treatment in order to generate Ig transcriptome and Ig peptide 
libraries. Ig peptides were overlapped with the corresponding IGH transcriptome 
in order to analyze B cell clones on a combined transcriptome and proteome 
level.
RESULTS: The analysis of peripheral blood B cell percentages pointed towards a 
significant decrease of memory B cells and an increase of naive B cells 
following cladribine therapy. While basic IGH repertoire parameters (e.g. 
variable heavy chain family usage and Ig subclasses) were only slightly affected 
by cladribine treatment, a significantly decreased number of clones and 
significantly lower diversity in the memory subset was noticeable at 6 months 
following treatment which was sustained at 12 months. When looking at B-cell 
clones comprising sequences from the different time-points, clones spanning 
between all three time-points were significantly more frequent than clones 
including sequences from two time-points. Furthermore, Ig proteome analyses 
showed that Ig transcriptome specific peptides could mostly be equally aligned 
to all three time-points pointing towards a proportion of B-cell clones that are 
maintained during treatment.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that peripheral B cell related treatment 
effects of cladribine tablets might be exerted through a reduction of possibly 
disease relevant clones in the memory B cell subset without disrupting the 
overall clonal composition of B cells. Our results -at least partially- might 
explain the relatively mild side effects regarding infections and the sustained 
immune response after vaccinations during treatment. However, exact disease 
driving B cell subsets and their effects remain unknown and should be addressed 
in future studies.","Copyright © 2023 Ruschil, Gabernet, Kemmerer, Jarboui, Klose, Poli, Ziemann,

TCR/co-stimulatory molecules to either undergo clonal deletion or to 
differentiate into specialized regulatory T (Treg) or effector T (Teff) CD4+ 
cells. How these different fates are achieved during development remains poorly 
understood. We now document that deletion and differentiation are 
agonist-signaled at different times during thymic selection and that Treg and 
Teff cells both arise after clonal deletion as alternative lineage fates of 
agonist-signaled CD4+CD25+ precursors. Disruption of agonist signaling induces 
CD4+CD25+ precursors to initiate Foxp3 expression and become Treg cells, whereas 
persistent agonist signaling induces CD4+CD25+ precursors to become IL-2+ Teff 
cells. Notably, we discovered that transforming growth factor-β induces Foxp3 
expression and promotes Treg cell development by disrupting weaker agonist 
signals and that Foxp3 expression is not induced by IL-2 except under 
non-physiological in vivo conditions. Thus, TCR signaling disruption versus 
persistence is a general mechanism of lineage fate determination in the thymus 
that directs development of agonist-signaled autoreactive thymocytes.","© 2023. This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the

stroke-associated pneumonia, which is generally defined as pneumonia occurring 
in the first week after stroke. However, little is known whether the initial NLR 
is associated with pneumonia risk during the long-term follow-up in stroke 
survivors. We aimed to determine the relationship between admission NLR and the 
risk of post-stroke pneumonia within 1 year after discharge from acute stroke 
care.
METHODS: Hospital databases were searched to identify adult patients 
hospitalized for acute stroke. Admission NLR was extracted using differential 
leukocyte counts. The outcome of interest was hospitalized pneumonia occurring 
within 1 year after discharge from hospitalization for stroke. Multivariable Cox 
proportional-hazards models were used to determine the independent effects of 
the NLR on the risk of pneumonia.
RESULTS: In this study, 5,741 patients with acute stroke (mean age, 68 years; 
men, 62.1%) were analyzed. The median NLR was 2.72 (interquartile range, 
1.78-4.49). Of the patients, 342 (6.0%) developed pneumonia within 1 year after 
discharge. In the multivariable models, the NLR was a significant predictor of 
pneumonia after discharge whether it was analyzed as a continuous or 
dichotomized variable. The corresponding adjusted hazard ratios were 1.037 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.013-1.061) and 1.361 (95% CI, 1.087-1.704), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The NLR could predict the risk of post-stroke pneumonia up to 1 year 
after discharge from acute stroke care. It may help identify high-risk stroke 
survivors, for whom appropriate interventions can be targeted.","© 2023 S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000529531

idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), connective-tissue disease (CTD)-related 
ILD, and sarcoidosis, using two panels including 64 markers. Among myeloid

various stages of differentiation in BALF, with a higher percentage of IgG 
memory B cells in CTD-ILDs and a trend toward more FCRL5+ B cells. These FCRL5+ 
B cells were also present in the patient with AEx-IPF and sarcoidosis with 
advanced lung lesions. Among T cells, we found increased levels of IL-2R+ TIGIT+

with HIV (PLWH) over a period longer than 3 months are currently limited. We 
measured the immune response after BNT162b2 vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in 
this population.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled PLWH on successful antiretroviral therapy, 
initiating vaccination with two doses of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
administered at six-week interval. SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular responses and 
lymphocyte cell subsets were recorded at inclusion and 6 weeks (W6), 3 months 
(M3) and 6 months (M6) later. Humoral, humoral strong and cellular responders 
were defined by IgG titers >10, ≥264BAU/mL and IFN-γ T cell release, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Nineteen subjects without SARS-CoV-2 infection were included (74% men, 
mean age 51 years, CD4 nadir 399/mm3). All subjects were humoral responders, 
their antibody titer peak reached at M3. Strong responders' rates were 63% and 
21% at M3 and M6, respectively. CD19+CD10+ B cells had increased significantly 
at W6 then decreased at M3, while CD19+CD27+ B cells remained unchanged. Rates 
of patients with a cellular response increased from 39% at W6 to 69% at M6. 
Cellular responders had significantly higher CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ Effector Memory 
cells at inclusion (p=0.048, p=0.024, p=0.012, respectively) and CD4+ Terminally 
Differentiated Effector Memory cells at M3 (p=0.044).
DISCUSSION: PLWH have a robust immune response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, but 
a rapid decline in humoral response from 3 months onwards, due to a blunted 
memory B cell response. Analysis of lymphocyte subsets may help identify optimal 
times for vaccine boosters.","Copyright © 2023 Manni, Ruetsch, Fabre, Ticchioni, Graça, Pradier, Seitz-Polski,

because of underdiagnosis. Nevertheless, the presentation of spinal gout in a 
patient who was never diagnosed with gout or hyperuricemia is rare. In addition, 
the probability of occurrence of spinal gout at the thoracic spine is low, 
making this case unique. Late or missed diagnosis causes treatment delays with 
grave outcomes. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old man with a past medical history of 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with rapid and progressive weakness of 
the lower extremities that led to complete paraplegia over 2 weeks. Magnetic 
resonance imaging showed severe central canal stenosis with disc protrusion and 
a T4-5 ventral mass with abnormal marrow signaling. The margins at the erosion 
were sclerotic, and malignancy was top on the differential diagnosis. Open 
minimally invasive laminectomy with discectomy at T4-5 was done. Sections on the 
biopsy specimen demonstrated fragments of benign cartilage and bone and multiple 
granulomas palisading around areas of crystalline material, consistent with 
tophaceous gout. He was started on a urate-lowering treatment per the American 
College of Rheumatology guideline. Unfortunately, due to the late patient 
presentation, neurologic recovery was not possible. CONCLUSIONS This case report 
illustrates an unusual presentation of gout with a catastrophic complication 
that could have been prevented with early diagnosis and treatment. Some reports 
have described patients with tophaceous deposits in the absence of gout flare 
among patients with urate overproduction due to myeloproliferative disorders. 
Further studies are needed to explore such relationships.","DOI: 10.12659/AJCR.938852

components is extremely rare. Here, we present a case of DLBCL with signet ring 
cell components involving the breast, which can be easily confused with invasive 
lobular carcinoma of the breast or metastatic signet ring cell carcinoma of 
gastrointestinal origin.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old woman presented with a painless mass in her 
left breast. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast revealed a 
42 × 29 × 28 mm mass in the left breast. Histological examination revealed a 
diffuse or scattered arrangement of round cells mixed with signet ring-like 
cells. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for PAX-5, 
CD79a, CD20, Bcl-6, and MUM-1 but and negative for cytokeratin, ER, PR, 
E-cadherin, and P120. The Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 70%. 
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) demonstrated non-rearrangement of 
Bcl-2, Bcl-6, and c-MYC genes. Immunohistochemistry and FISH examination 
confirmed the diagnosis of DLBCL. Subsequently, immunofluorescence showed both 
IgM and IgG deposits in the signet ring-like lymphocytes. After confirming the 
diagnosis, the patient received four courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) chemotherapy in a specialist 
hospital and achieved partial remission; however, she unfortunately died of 
secondary pneumocystis pneumonia infection 3 months later.
CONCLUSION: Malignant lymphoma with signet ring cell morphology is quite 
uncommon, and this variant can be a diagnostic pitfall. We emphasise that 
pathologists should consider lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of malignant 
breast tumours.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12905-023-02285-4

from murine studies performed in C57BL/6 mice. Here, using both C57BL/6 and 
BALB/c mice, we analyze immune cells in the pleural cavity. Unlike C57BL/6 mice, 
naive tissue-resident large-cavity macrophages (LCMs) of BALB/c mice failed to 
fully implement the tissue-residency program. Following infection with a 
pleural-dwelling nematode, these pre-existing differences were accentuated with 
LCM expansion occurring in C57BL/6, but not in BALB/c mice. While infection 
drove monocyte recruitment in both strains, only in C57BL/6 mice were monocytes 
able to efficiently integrate into the resident pool. Monocyte-to-macrophage 
conversion required both T cells and interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) 
signaling. The transition to tissue residency altered macrophage function, and 
GATA6+ tissue-resident macrophages were required for host resistance to nematode 
infection. Therefore, during tissue nematode infection, T helper 2 (Th2) cells 
control the differentiation pathway of resident macrophages, which determines 
infection outcome.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.immuni.2023.02.016

been hindered by its complex and costly manufacturing process. Induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have shown promise as a cellular immunotherapy 
alternative, due to their unlimited self-renewal potential in culture and 
capacity to differentiate into functional immune cell types. However, it is 
imperative to carefully select the original cell for iPSC seed preparation, as 
iPSCs have been found to retain the epigenetic imprint of the original somatic 
cells. Additionally, the efficiency of reprogramming terminal differentiated

superiority of lymphocyte-origin cells over embryonic stem cells in functional 
immune cell differentiation. Furthermore, blocking Fas-FasL induced apoptosis in 
T cells significantly improves iPSC generation. Interestingly, transient Fas 
suppression in T cells does not alter the expression of Fas in the resulting 
iPSCs or affect their differentiation potential. This finding brings up new

studying aging. However, the development and degeneration of immune organs in 
annual fishes and the antagonistic effects of resveratrol remain unclear. In the 
present study, the development of thymus and kidney was investigated 
systematically using N. guentheri from larvae, juveniles, young and old fish 
with H&E staining. We found that thymus primordium was observed first in the 
larvae at 2 days after hatching (dah). After the lymphoid cells became evident 
at 5 dah, the thymus acquired an irregular shape at 7 dah. Then it formed a 
wedge-shape at 15 dah. Thymus looked as homogeneous distribution of lymphocytes 
at 1-month-old, and it differentiated into cortex and medulla approximately 
2-month-old fish. Combined with TUNEL and SA-β-gal staining, it showed the 
degeneration of thymus appeared from 4-month-old fish. Kidney primordium 
appeared on 1 dah, and the glomerulus was visible at 7 dah. The nephrogenic 
activity was most apparent in 1-month-old fish. A large hematopoietic tissue was 
arranged in the renal interstitium in 2- and 3-month-old fish. In 6-month-old 
fish, the kidney structure became less dense. By 12 months, kidney exhibited the 
most pronounced histological characteristics of aging. Feeding resveratrol 
ameliorated renal fibrosis and SA-β-gal staining with age, increased SIRT1 and

expression levels fluctuate, and point mutations and methylation occur in cancer 
cells; however, to date, there have been no reports of carcinogenic point 
mutations in miRNAs. MicroRNA 142 (miR-142) is frequently mutated in patients 
with follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL), and acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS). 
To understand the role of miR-142 mutation in blood cancers, the CRISPR-Cas9 
system was utilized to successfully generate miR-142-55A>G mutant knock-in (Ki) 
mice, simulating the most frequent mutation in patients with miR-142 mutated 
AML/MDS. Bone marrow cells from miR-142 mutant heterozygous Ki mice were 
transplanted, and we found that the miR-142 mutant/wild-type cells were 
sufficient for the development of CD8+ T-cell leukemia in mice 
post-transplantation. RNA-sequencing analysis in hematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cells and CD8+ T-cells revealed that miR-142-Ki/+ cells had increased expression 
of the mTORC1 activator, a potential target of wild-type miR-142-3p. Notably, 
the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, differentiation, and the 
inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway was suppressed in miR-142-55A>G heterozygous 
cells, indicating that these genes are repressed by the mutant miR-142-3p. Thus, 
in addition to the loss of function due to the halving of wild-type miR-142-3p 
alleles, mutated miR-142-3p gained the function to suppress the expression of 
distinct target genes, sufficient to cause leukemogenesis in mice.","© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Science published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

CD4+ T cells in inflammatory bowel diseases remain unclear. In the current 
study, we characterised the expression and function of zinc finger protein 189 
(ZFP189) in a murine colitis model. Mice were given dextran sulphate sodium to 
induce acute colitis. Flow cytometry was applied to recognise and enrich Th17 
and Th17.1 cells based on the expression of IL-17A, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), C-X-C 
motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), and C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). 
The expression of ZFP189 in Th17 and Th17.1 cells was determined by 
Immunoblotting. Lentivirus-mediated ZFP189 knockdown was conducted to evaluate 
the effect of ZFP189 on the differentiation of Th17 and Th17.1 cells. The 
adoptive transfer was performed to analyse the pathogenicity of Th17.1 cells in 
vivo. We found that ZFP189 was mildly up-regulated in IL-17A-expressing CD4+ T 
cells in colonic lamina propria. Lamina propria Th17.1 cells expressed higher 
ZFP189 than Th17 cells. In vitro ZFP189 knockdown in CD4+ T cells did not impact 
Th17 cell differentiation but suppressed Th17.1 cell differentiation, as 
evidenced by lower T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) and IFN-γ. When adoptively 
transferred into mice, ZFP189-deficient Th17.1 cells produced fewer IFN-γ, 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) than ZFP189-expressing Th17.1 cells. 
Moreover, ZFP189-deficient Th17.1 cells induced less severe colitis than 
ZFP189-expressing Th17.1 cells, as evidenced by less body weight loss, a lower 
disease activity index, and a lower colon histological score. In summary, ZFP189

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The capacity of self-renewal and multipotent differentiation makes 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) one of the most widely investigated cell lines in 
preclinical studies as cell-based therapies. However, the low survival rate and 
poor homing efficiency of MSCs after transplantation hinder the therapeutic 
application. Exosomes derived from MSCs have shown promising therapeutic 
potential in many diseases. However, the heterogeneity of MSCs may lead to 
differences in the function of secreting exosomes. In this study, the 
therapeutic effects of hUC-Exos and hFP-Exos on the DSS-induced colitis mouse 
model were investigated.
METHODS: The colitis mouse models were randomly divided into four groups: (1) 
DSS administered for 7 days and euthanasia (DSS7D), (2) DSS administered for 
7 days and kept for another 7 days without any treatment (DSS14D), (3) DSS 
administered for 7 days and followed with hUC-EVs infusion for 7 days (hUC-EVs) 
and (4) DSS administered for 7 days and followed with hFP-EVs infusion for 
7 days (hFP-EVs). We analyzed colon length, histopathology, Treg cells, 
cytokines and gut microbiota composition in each group.
RESULTS: A large amount of IL-6, IL-17 and IFN-γ were produced along with the 
decrease in the number of CD4 + Foxp3 + and CD8 + Foxp3 + cells in DSS7D group, 
which indicated that Th17 cells were activated and Treg cells were suppressed. 
We found that the number of CD4 + Foxp3 + and CD8 + Foxp3 + cells increased in 
order to suppress inflammation, but the length of colon did not recover and the 
symotoms were worsened of the colonic tissue in DSS14D group. The subsequent 
infusion of either hUC-Exos or hFP-Exos mediated the transformation of Treg and 
Th17 cells in colitis mice to maintain immune balance. The infusion of hUC-Exos 
and hFP-Exos also both reduced the abundance of pro-inflammatory intestinal 
bacterial such as Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia muciniphila to improve 
colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that Foxp3 + Treg cells can inhibit the inflammatory 
response, and the over-activated Treg cells can still further damage the 
intestinal mucosa. hUC-Exos and hFP-Exos can control inflammation by regulating 
the balance between Th17 cells and Treg cells. Decreased inflammatory response 
improved the structure of colon wall in mice and reduced the abundance of 
pro-inflammatory bacteria in the intestine. The improvement of intestinal wall 
structure provides conditions for the reproduction of beneficial bacteria, which 
further contributes to the reduction of colitis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13287-023-03263-1

of immunity with almost unknown etiology. This study aimed to investigate the 
clinical diagnostic and prognostic values of lymphocyte subsets and function in 
symptomatic SIgAD patients.
METHODS: A total of 30 available SIgAD patients from the Iranian registry and 30 
age-sex-matched healthy controls were included in the present study. We analyzed 
B and T cell peripheral subsets and T cell proliferation assay by flow cytometry 
in SIgAD patients with mild and severe clinical phenotypes.
RESULTS: Our results indicated a significant increase in naïve and transitional 
B cells and a strong decrease in marginal zone-like and switched memory B-cells 
in SIgAD patients. We found that naïve and central memory CD4+ T cell subsets, 
as well as Th1, Th2 and regulatory T cells, have significantly decreased. On the 
other hand, there was a significant reduction in central and effector memory 
CD8+ T cell subsets, whereas proportions of both (CD4+ and CD8+) terminally 
differentiated effector memory T cells (TEMRA) were significantly elevated in 
our patients. Although some T cell subsets in severe SIgAD were similar, a 
decrease in marginal-zone and switched memory B cells and an increase in CD21low 
B cell of severe SIgAD patients were slightly prominent. Moreover, the 
proliferation activity of CD4+ T cells was strongly impaired in SIgAD patients 
with a severe phenotype.
CONCLUSION: SIgAD patients have varied cellular and humoral deficiencies. 
Therefore, T cell and B cell assessment might help in better understanding the 
heterogeneous pathogenesis and prognosis estimation of the disease.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13223-023-00775-6

Following DNCB administration, the expression of CD226 was elevated in 
intestinal mucosal tissues, including group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and

intestinal immune response in the AD-like mice, as evidenced by increased 
inflammation and Th1/Th2-related cytokine levels as well as increased Paneth 
cell numbers and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression, which was likely due to 
the higher interleukin (IL)-22 production in the lamina propria. Additionally, 
CD226 deficiency increased the production of IL-4 and IL-17 in mesenteric lymph 
nodes as well as the number of PPs and expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) A in B 
cells. Moreover, insufficient expression of CD226 affected the characterization

in serum. The number of differentiated inflammation cells and goblet cells in 
tissues that elevated by OVA was reduced by quercetin. Moreover, OVA increased 
the Treg cell percentage, the levels of IL-17, TGF-β, IL-6, TNF-α, and decreased 
Th17 cell percentage, IL-10 and FOXP3 levels, while quercetin abrogated their 
levels induced by OVA. Additionally, quercetin inactivated the NF-κB pathway. 
Taken together, quercetin attenuated AR symptoms by balancing the Th1/Th2, 
Treg/Th17 ratios, and inactivating the NF-κB pathway. The results suggested that 
quercetin may use for AR treatment.","DOI: 10.1080/08916934.2023.2189133

the ex-vivo generation of tumor-reactive cells in sufficient numbers and with 
enhanced cytotoxic potential. It was recently demonstrated that culturing of 
activated murine CD8+ T-cells on a ""Synthetic Immune Niche"" (SIN), consisting of 
immobilized CCL21 and ICAM-1, enhances T-cell expansion, increases their 
cytotoxicity against cultured cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. 
In the study reported here, we have tested the effect of the CCL21+ICAM1 SIN, on 
the expansion and cytotoxic phenotype of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) 
from melanoma patients, following activation with immobilized anti-CD3/CD28 
stimulation, or commercial activation beads. The majority of TIL tested, 
displayed higher expansion when cultured on the coated SIN compared to cells 
incubated on uncoated substrate and a lower frequency of TIM-3+CD8+ cells after 
stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Comparable enhancement of TIL 
proliferation was obtained by the CCL21+ICAM1 SIN, in a clinical setting that 
included a 14-day rapid expansion procedure (REP). Co-incubation of post-REP TIL 
with matching target cancerous cells demonstrated increased IFNγ secretion 
beyond baseline in most of the TIL cultures, as well as a significant increase 
in granzyme B levels following activation on SIN. The SIN did not significantly 
alter the relative frequency of CD8/CD4 populations, as well as the expression 
of CD28, CD25, several exhaustion markers and the differentiation status of the 
expanded cells. These results demonstrate the potential capacity of the 
CCL21+ICAM1 SIN to reinforce TIL-based immunotherapy for cancer patients.","Copyright © 2023 Yunger, Geiger, Friedman, Besser and Adutler-Lieber.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1116328

medicine for therapy of cervical human papillomavirus infection. The mechanism 
of action of Nr-CWS is unclear but may involve a stimulatory effect on the host 
immune system. We previously found that CD4+ T cells were increased in cervical 
tissue after Nr-CWS treatment. Microarray data from these cervical tissues 
revealed the significant upregulation of formylated peptide receptor 3 (FPR3). 
This study aimed to explore the role of Nr-CWS in immunomodulatory based on 
these findings. Examination of CD4+ T cell subsets in cervical tissue from 
patients who received Nr-CWS revealed substantial increases in Th1 cytokines and 
transcription factors. The regulatory effects of Nr-CWS on the function and 
phenotype of dendritic cells (DCs) were assessed in comparison with the 
traditional DC maturation inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similar to LPS, 
Nr-CWS potently induced DC maturation and interleukin-12 (IL-12) secretion. 
Differentiation of T cells induced by Nr-CWS stimulated DCs was assessed using 
the mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. Significant differentiation towards Th1 was 
evident. Finally, FPR3 expression in DCs in response to Nr-CWS and LPS was 
measured. Nr-CWS potently upregulated FPR3 expression, while the LPS did not. 
Silencing FPR3 in DCs reduced Nr-CWS-induced IL-12 production and Th1 cell 
polarization in co-cultured T cells. The collective findings indicate that 
Nr-CWS may target FPR3 on the surface of DC cells and activate a Th1-type immune 
response. The findings clarify the basis of the antiviral immune effects of 
Nr-CWS on human papillomavirus.","Copyright © 2023 Guo, Chen, Sun, Zhao, Bai, Zhang, Liu, Zhang and Shao.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1117545

have been shown to induce robust immune responses. Recent studies demonstrated 
that the immune responses of people who received one dose of ChAdOx1 and one 
dose of BNT were better than those of people who received vaccines with two 
homologous ChAdOx1 or two BNT doses. However, how heterologous vaccines function 
has not been extensively investigated. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing 
data from three classes of samples: volunteers vaccinated with heterologous 
ChAdOx1-BNT and volunteers vaccinated with homologous ChAd-ChAd and BNT-BNT 
vaccinations after 7 days were divided into three types of immune cells (3654 B, 
8212 CD4+ T, and 5608 CD8+ T cells). To identify differences in gene expression 
in various cell types induced by vaccines administered through different 
vaccination strategies, multiple advanced feature selection methods 
(max-relevance and min-redundancy, Monte Carlo feature selection, least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator, light gradient boosting machine, and 
permutation feature importance) and classification algorithms (decision tree and 
random forest) were integrated into a computational framework. Feature selection 
methods were in charge of analyzing the importance of gene features, yielding 
multiple gene lists. These lists were fed into incremental feature selection, 
incorporating decision tree and random forest, to extract essential genes, 
classification rules and build efficient classifiers. Highly ranked genes 
include PLCG2, whose differential expression is important to the B cell immune 
pathway and is positively correlated with immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells, 
and B2M, which is associated with thymic T cell differentiation. This study gave 
an important contribution to the mechanistic explanation of results showing the 
stronger immune response of a heterologous ChAdOx1-BNT vaccination schedule than 
two doses of either BNT or ChAdOx1, offering a theoretical foundation for 
vaccine modification.","Copyright © 2023 Li, Huang, Ma, Guo, Feng, Huang and Cai.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1131051

cellular and a humoral arm. The B-cell branch with its memory B cells (MBCs), 
plasma cells and antibodies, formed either in a germinal centre (GC) -dependent 
or -independent manner, ensure that we can rapidly mount a recall immune 
response. Previous work in immunised wildtype (WT) mice have identified several 
subsets of MBCs whereas less is known under autoimmune conditions. Here, we have 
investigated the heterogeneity of the MBC compartment in autoimmune mouse models 
and examined the clonal relationships between MBC subsets and GC B cells in one 
of the models. We demonstrate the presence of at least four different MBC 
subsets based on their differential expression pattern of CD73, CD80 and PD-L2 
in surrogate light chain-deficient (SLC-/-), MRL+/+ and MRLlpr/lpr mice, where 
most of the MBCs express IgM. Likewise, four MBC subsets could be identified in 
WT immunised mice. In SLC-/- mice, high-throughput sequencing of Ig heavy chains 
demonstrates that the two CD73-positive subsets are generally more mutated. 
Lineage tree analyses on expanded clones show overlaps between all MBC subsets 
and GC B cells primarily in the IgM sequences. Moreover, each of the three IgM 
MBC subsets could be found both as ancestor and progeny to GC B cells. This was 
also observed in the IgG sequences except for the CD73-negative subset. Thus, 
our findings demonstrate that several MBC subsets are present in autoimmune and 
WT mice. In SLC-/- mice, these MBC subsets are clonally related to each other 
and to GC B cells. Our results also indicate that different MBC subsets can seed 
the GC reaction.","Copyright © 2023 Aranburu, Engström, Gerasimcik, Alsén, Camponeschi, Yrlid,

research, but challenges include the impact of tissue disaggregation on cell 
phenotypes and the low abundance of immune cells in many tissues. Here, we 
describe methods to troubleshoot and standardize Cellular Indexing of 
Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) for studies involving 
enzymatic digestion of human tissue. We tested epitope susceptibility of 92 
antibodies commonly used to differentiate immune lineages and cell states on 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells following treatment with an enzymatic 
digestion cocktail used to isolate islets. We observed CD4, CD8a, CD25, CD27, 
CD120b, CCR4, CCR6, and PD1 display significant sensitivity to enzymatic 
treatment, effects that often could not be overcome with alternate antibodies. 
Comparison of flow cytometry-based CITE-seq antibody titrations and sequencing 
data supports that for the majority of antibodies, flow cytometry accurately 
predicts optimal antibody concentrations for CITE-seq. Comparison by CITE-seq of 
immune cells in enzymatically digested islet tissue and donor-matched spleen not 
treated with enzymes revealed little digestion-induced epitope cleavage, 
suggesting increased sensitivity of CITE-seq and/or that the islet structure may 
protect resident immune cells from enzymes. Within islets, CITE-seq identified 
immune cells difficult to identify by transcriptional signatures alone, such as 
distinct tissue-resident T cell subsets, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells 
(ILCs). Collectively this study identifies strategies for the rational design 
and testing of CITE-seq antibodies for single-cell studies of immune cells

acquire immunostimulatory activity and transmit the immune information to naïve 
T cells. Then activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells, 
while CD4+ T helper cells release cytokines to aid the activity of other immune 
cells, and help B cells produce antibodies. Thus, detailed insights into the DC 
maturation process are necessary for us to understand the working principle of

autoimmune disease. This review summarizes the DC maturation process, including 
environment sensing and antigen sampling by resting DCs, antigen processing and

gastrointestinal cancers. Evidence for the importance of inflammation and 
immunology in the development and progression of CRC is growing steadily. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the clinical importance of Lactic 
Dehydrogenase (LDH) to Albumin (ALB) Ratio (LAR) and immune-inflammation 
biomarkers (IIBs) in patients with CRC.
METHODS: This study enrolled 382 CRC patients. The LAR was determined as the 
serum LDH(U/l) to ALB(g/l) ratio. We compared the levels of LAR and IIBs in 
different TNM stages and tumor differentiation. The relationship between LAR and 
IIBs and overall survival (OS) of CRC was determined by Cox regression models. A 
prognostic nomogram was created using the results of the multivariate analysis 
and the effectiveness of the nomogram was assessed using the ROC, calibration, 
and decision curves. We evaluated the relationship between LAR and IIBs and 
clinical features of CRC.
RESULTS: The levels of LAR, SII, NLR and PLR in TNM IV stage group (LAR:5.92 
(5.23-8.24); SII: 1040.02 (499.51-1683.54); NLR: 2.87 (2.07-5.3); PLR:187.08 
(125.31-276.63)) were significantly higher than those in other groups. LAR and 
NLR showed no significant difference in different tumor differentiation groups, 
while SII and PLR in undifferentiated groups (SII:543.72 (372.63-1110.20); PLR: 
147.06 (106.04-203.92)) were significantly higher than those in well and 
moderate groups (SII: 474.29 (323.75-716.01); PLR: 126.28 (104.31-167.88)). LAR 
(HR = 1.317, 95% CI = 1.019-1.454), TNM stage (HR = 2.895, 95% 
CI = 1.838-4.559), age (HR = 1.766, 95% CI = 1.069-2.922) and lymphocytes 
(HR = 0.663, 95% CI = 0.456-0.963) were predictors of OS. IIBs, including SII, 
NLR, and PLR are independent of OS. The LAR-based nomogram AUCs of 1-year, 
3-year and 5-year survival probabilities in the training cohort were 0.86, 0.72, 
and 0.71, respectively, and the AUCs of the validation cohort were 0.85, 0.71, 
and 0.69 respectively. The LAR-based nomogram's ROC curves and calibration 
curves demonstrated higher OS discriminative performance. The decision curves 
demonstrated greater net benefit in the survival prediction.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative LAR is a potential prognostic marker in CRC patients, 
while SII, NLR, and PLR are independent of OS. LAR was associated with tumor 
stage in CRC patients, but not with tumor differentiation.","© 2023 Wu, Wu, Wang, Zeng, Wang, Zhou and Wang.","DOI: 10.3389/fsurg.2023.1118403

infiltration sites of TRIM21 in OLP were detected by immunoblot, 
immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Expression of proinflammatory

activator of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) to observe ILC2s changes. The 
lung inflammatory response to Fe2O3 NPs was alleviated in Rag1-/- mice compared 
with wild type (WT) mice. Infiltration of inflammatory cells and collagen 
deposition in tissue, leukocyte numbers (neutrophils, macrophages and 
lymphocytes), cytokine levels, such as IL-6, IL-13 and thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin (TSLP), and expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and 
downstream myeloid differentiation factor (MyD)88, nuclear factor (NF)-κB and 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were decreased in lungs. Fe2O3 NPs markedly 
elevated ILC2s compared with the control, but ILC2s numbers were much lower 
compared with IL-33 in both WT and Rag1-/- mice. Furthermore, ILC2s amounts were 
strongly greater in Rag1-/- mice than WT mice. Our results suggested that Fe2O3 
NPs induced sub-chronic pulmonary inflammation, which is majorly dependent on T 
cells and B cells rather than ILC2s.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.fct.2023.113735

the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in immunoregulatory and 
tolerogenic programs is barely understood. Here, we investigated the mechanisms 
underlying hypothyroid-related immunosuppression by examining the regulatory 
role of components of the HPT axis. We first analyzed lymphocyte activity in 
mice overexpressing the TRH gene (Tg-Trh). T cells from Tg-Trh showed increased 
proliferation than wild-type (WT) euthyroid mice in response to polyclonal 
activation. The release of Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines was also increased in 
Tg-Trh and TSH levels correlated with T-cell proliferation. To gain further 
mechanistic insights into hypothyroidism-related immunosuppression, we evaluated 
T-cell subpopulations in lymphoid tissues of hypothyroid and control mice. No 
differences were observed in CD3/CD19 or CD4/CD8 ratios between these strains. 
However, the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly increased 
in hypothyroid mice, and not in Tg-Trh mice. Accordingly, in vitro Tregs 
differentiation was more pronounced in naïve T cells isolated from hypothyroid 
mice. Since Tregs overexpress galectin-1 (Gal-1) and mice lacking this lectin 
(Lgals1-/- ) show reduced Treg function, we investigated the involvement of this 
immunoregulatory lectin in the control of Tregs in settings of hypothyroidism. 
Increased T lymphocyte reactivity and reduced frequency of Tregs were found in 
hypothyroid Lgals1-/- mice when compared to hypothyroid WT animals. This effect 
was rescued by the addition of recombinant Gal-1. Finally, increased expression 
of Gal-1 was found in Tregs purified from hypothyroid WT mice compared with 
their euthyroid counterpart. Thus, a substantial increase in the frequency and 
activity of Gal-1-expressing Tregs underlies immunosuppression associated with 
hypothyroid conditions, with critical implications in immunopathology, metabolic 
disorders, and cancer.",© 2023 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.,"DOI: 10.1096/fj.202200884R

cells is their low proportion in peripheral blood leukocytes. This issue is 
currently addressed by methods involving a series of differentiation and 
expansions that are time-consuming and expensive.
OBJECTIVE: We have investigated whether the used leukocyte reduction filters, a 
by-product in the blood transfusion practice that currently is considered waste, 
can be utilized as a source of the NK cells.
METHODS: Following the blood donation of 46 donors based on the Iranian Blood 
Transfusion Organization's protocols, a sample of peripheral blood of each donor 
and the leukocyte reduction filter used in their donation procedure have been 
obtained. The entrapped cells were flushed back from the leukocyte reduction 
filters. Both groups of samples were analyzed using an automatic hematological 
analyzer. NK cell isolation was done by the MACS negative selection method. The 
samples have been comparatively analyzed utilizing flow cytometry data of NK 
cells' subpopulation compositions, viability, degranulation patterns, and 
cytotoxic capacity against the K562 cell line.
RESULTS: Every major leukocyte population was abundant in the samples extracted 
from the used leukocyte reduction filters. The NK cells extracted from leukocyte 
reduction filters did not show any statistically meaningful differences (P<0.5) 
from peripheral blood samples in terms of subpopulation composition, viability, 
degranulation potency, and cytotoxic capacity.
CONCLUSION: Used leukocyte reduction filters can be considered an economic, easy 
to obtain, and robust source of abundant research-grade NK cells.","DOI: 10.22034/iji.2023.92527.2158

rhinitis (AR). Moreover, interleukin (IL)-38 is thought to be involved in 
inhibiting cytokine secretion in the Th17 pathway.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the regulatory function of IL-38 on abnormal Th17 
responses in Chinese patients with AR.
METHODS: Forty-five participants, divided into an AR group (n=25) and a control 
group (n=20), were recruited for the study. In addition, the expression of IL-38 
and Th17-related cytokines was measured as well as the Th17 cell count in 
participants. By implementing recombinant IL-38 (rIL-38), the intervention of 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed. Then, flow 
cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) were used to detect the Th17 milieu.
RESULTS: The expression of IL-38 in the AR group notably reduced compared with 
that in the control, whereas Th17 cell frequency and the expression levels of 
its transcription factor (RORC) and cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23) increased. The 
differentiation and immune function of Th17 cells in PBMCs were inhibited by 
rIL-38.
CONCLUSION: Th17 responses are inhibited by IL-38 in patients with AR.

OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to explore the mechanism of methyl-cpg-binding 
domain protein 2 (MBD2) in CD4+T cell differentiation stimulated by 
environmental allergen ovalbumin (OVA).
METHODS: Mononuclear cells were separated from the spleen tissues of male 
C57BL/6 mice. The OVA interfered with the differentiation of splenic mononuclear 
cells and CD4+T cells. The CD4+T cells were obtained by magnetic beads and 
identified by CD4 labeled antibody. CD4+T cells were transfected with lentivirus 
to silence MBD2 gene. A methylation quantification kit was used to detect 5-mC 
levels.
RESULTS: The purity of CD4+T cells reached 95.99% after magnetic beads sorting. 
Treatment with 200 μg/mL OVA stimulated the CD4+T cells differentiation to Th17 
cells and promoted the secretion of IL-17. After being induced, the Th17 cell 
ratio increased. 5-Aza inhibited the Th17 cell differentiation and the IL-17 
level in a dose-dependent manner. Under the intervention of the Th17 induction 
and 5-Aza, MBD2 silencing inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cell, and 
decreased the IL-17 and 5-mC levels in the cell supernatants. MBD2 silencing 
reduced the scale of the Th17 cell and IL-17 levels in the OVA-treated CD4+T

high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate 
statistical analysis techniques, including principal component analysis and 
orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. The metabolite profiles 
of anosmia and control groups were found to be significantly separated. Ten 
different differential metabolites, mainly including amino acids, such as 
isoleucine and methionine, and lipids, such as phosphatidylserine, were screened 
based on the combined analysis of variable importance in the projection and p 
values. In addition, six key differential metabolic pathways were analyzed using 
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and enriched for four metabolic 
pathways including the citrate acid (TCA) cycle, tyrosine metabolism, arginine 
and proline metabolism, and arginine synthesis. The TCA cycle enhances fertility 
through the reduction of pyruvate kinase, and intermediate derivatives (acetyl 
CoA, malonyl CoA) act as signaling factors that regulate immune cell function. 
The tyrosine cycle can indirectly participate and promote reproduction in black 
porgy through melanin-concentrating hormone. Arginine and proline metabolism can 
promote reproduction by promoting growth hormone and enhance immunity in anosmic 
black porgy by stimulating T lymphocytes. Our metabolomic study revealed that 
anosmia in black porgy played an active role in immunity and reproduction and

transplantation (KT). However, current immunosuppressants cannot induce immune 
tolerance, and their nonspecific immunosuppressive effects result in many

and their effects on kidney allograft function in Korean KT recipients. We 
enrolled 113 KT recipients with stable graft function. The differentiation and 
expansion of Tregs were examined by flow cytometry to compare the Tregs 
subpopulations. Among the 113 patients, 73 (64.6%) were males, and the mean 
follow-up period from KT to Tregs collection was 147.5 + 111.3 months. Patients 
receiving lower doses of cyclosporine had higher proportions of Tregs than those 
with higher doses of cyclosporine (36.3 + 21.6 vs 17.0 + 12.7, P = .010,

multiprotein chromatin-modifying complex. Its inactivation at the CD4/CD8 
double-negative stage halts further thymocyte development. Among various 
functions, Sin3A regulates STAT3 transcriptional activity, central to the 
differentiation of Th17 cells active in inflammatory disorders and opportunistic 
infections. To further investigate the consequences of conditional Sin3A 
inactivation in more mature precursors and post-thymic T cell, we have generated 
CD4-Cre and CD4-CreERT2 Sin3AF/F mice. Sin3A inactivation in vivo hinders both 
thymocyte development and peripheral T-cell survival. In vitro, in Th17 skewing 
conditions, Sin3A-deficient cells proliferate and acquire memory markers and yet 
fail to properly upregulate Il17a, Il23r, and Il22. Instead, IL-2+ and FOXP3+ 
are mostly enriched for, and their inhibition partially rescues IL-17A+ T cells. 
Notably, Sin3A deletion also causes an enrichment of genes implicated in the 
mTORC1 signaling pathway, overt STAT3 activation, and aberrant cytoplasmic RORγt

adult anti-melanoma differentiation-associated 5 gene (Anti-MDA5) 
antibody-positive dermatomyositis (DM) patients and evaluate the effects of 
tofacitinib on peripheral lymphocyte subsets.
METHODS: An open-label study was conducted of 15 new-onset, untreated adult 
patients with anti-MDA5-positive DM for tofacitinib with a dose of 5mg twice per 
day. The primary outcome was defined by the total improvement score after 
treatment for 6 months, classified according to the 2016 American College of 
Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) response criteria 
for adult DM and polymyositis. Secondary outcomes after 6 months treatment 
comprised the change in predicted forced vital capacity, the percentage of 
predicted carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, ferritin level and peripheral 
blood lymphocyte subsets measured by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Disease responses occurred in 10 patients (71.4%) after 6 months. The 
median total improvement score was 43.75 (41.875-59.375). Two patients achieved 
major improvement, seven achieved moderate and one minimal. The serum ferritin 
level (p = 0.008), DLCO% (p = 0.009) was improved and a marked increase in total 
lymphocyte cells (p = 0.045) and CD8+ T cells (p = 0.006) was measured after 6 
months treatment compared to baseline.
CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib demonstrates efficacy for new-onset, untreated adult 
patients with anti-MDA5-positive DM and stimulates proliferation of peripheral 
lymphocyte subsets (especially total lymphocyte cells and CD8+ T cells) after 6 
months treatment. Further studies are warranted to validate the current 
findings. Key Points • Treatment of anti-melanoma differentiation-associated 5 
gene antibody positive dermatomyositis is always challenging. • This 
prospective, open-label clinical trial demonstrates tofacitinib is an effective 
and safe agent for new-onset adult patients with anti-MDA5-positive DM. • 
Tofacitinib treatment results in an increase in peripheral lymphocyte numbers, 
especially CD8+ T cells at 6 months compared with pre-treatment levels.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International League of

transcription factors binding to them. GATA1 and TAL1 are 
hematopoietic/erythroid-specific factors and often bind together to enhancers, 
activating target genes. Interestingly, we found that some 
hematopoietic/erythroid genes are transcribed in a GATA1-dependent but 
TAL1-independnet manner. They appear to have enhancers within a relatively short 
distance. In this study, we paired highly transcribed hematopoietic/erythroid 
genes with the nearest GATA1/TAL1-binding enhancers and analyzed these putative 
enhancer-gene pairs depending on distance between them. Enhancers located at 
various distances from genes in the pairs, which was not related to 
transcription level of the genes. However, genes with enhancers at short 
distances away tended to be transcriptionally unaffected by TAL1 depletion. 
Histone H3K27ac extended from the enhancers to target genes. The H3K27ac 
extension was maintained without TAL1, even though it disappeared owing to the 
loss of GATA1. Intergenic RNA was highly transcribed from the enhancers to 
nearby target genes, independent of TAL1. Taken together, TAL1-independent 
transcription of hematopoietic/erythroid genes appears to be promoted by 
enhancers present in a short distance. These enhancers are likely to activate

epithelium leading to exposure of the submucosal connective tissue. These are 
common and usually self-limited lesions, although they may sometimes result from 
neoplasms, most commonly squamous cell carcinoma. Lymphoproliferative disorders 
may be difficult to diagnose in apthous ulcers since they mimic reactive 
inflammation.
METHODS: This review presents ten rare oral lymphoid proliferations which should 
not be missed when assessing oral ulcer biopsies.
RESULTS: The ten lesions include several with diagnostic cells which look 
similar to the histiocytes of a reactive inflammatory ulcer, including 
Rosai-Dorfman disease, reticulohistiocytoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and 
traumatic ulcerative granuloma. Other lesions, such as EBV-positive 
mucocutaneous ulcer, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosal-associated 
lymphoid tissue, and plasmablastic lymphoma have lymphoid and/or plasma cell 
differentiation that mimic the reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells found in 
reactive ulcers. Two dendritic cell lesions, follicular dendritic cell sarcoma 
and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, both have distinct phenotypes 
which are required to make an accurate diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Each of these lesions are diagnosed by evaluating their histology, 
along with their phenotypic profile, which is sometimes enhanced by pertinent 
molecular findings.","© 2023. This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the

acute heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, to assess the predictive and 
prognostic values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and to correlate its levels 
with brain natriuretic peptide and other various data in these patients.
METHOD: We included 50 children with acute heart failure due to dilated 
cardiomyopathy as the patient group. Fifty healthy children of matched age and 
sex served as the control group. Patients were evaluated clinically and by 
echocardiography. A complete blood count with differentiation to evaluate 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was done, and the serum level of brain 
natriuretic peptide was also measured. All patients were followed up for death 
or readmission for a period of one year.
RESULTS: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher in patient 
group as compared to the control group. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was 
significantly increased in patients with higher severity of heart failure. There 
was a significant increase in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients with 
bad prognoses compared to those with good prognoses. There was a significant 
positive correlation between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and both brain 
natriuretic peptide and clinical stage of heart failure while there was a 
significant negative correlation between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and left 
ventricular systolic function. The best cut-off of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio to predict adverse outcomes in children with dilated cardiomyopathy was 
>3.6 with 87% sensitivity and 79% specificity. The cut-off of 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio to predict patients who will not respond to

clinical outcomes in bladder cancer. Identification of correlates of benefit is 
critical to select appropriate therapy for individual patients.
METHODS: To reveal genetic variables associated with benefit from ICB, we 
performed whole-exome sequencing on tumor specimens from 88 patients with 
advanced bladder cancer treated with ICB.
RESULTS: We identified several genetic factors that correlated with 
progression-free and overall survival after ICB therapy including ARID1A 
mutation, tumor mutational burden, intratumoral heterogeneity, the ratio of 
nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations in the immunopeptidome (immune dN/dS), and 
tumor cell purity. In addition, we noted that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and 
smoking history were negatively associated with overall survival. These genetic 
characteristics define four molecular subtypes demonstrating differential 
sensitivity to ICB. We validated the association of these four subtypes with 
clinical benefit from ICB in an independent cohort (IMvigor210). Finally, we 
showed that these molecular subtypes also correlate with outcome, although with 
distinct relationships, among patients not treated with ICB using The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) bladder cancer cohort. Using parallel RNA sequencing data, 
the subtypes were also shown to correlate with immune infiltration and 
inflammation, respectively, in the IMvigor210 and TCGA cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Together, our study defines molecular subgroups of bladder cancer 
that influence benefit from ICB.","DOI: 10.1200/JCO.22.02144

control local pathogen replication. CD103 has been used to broadly define 
subsets of Trms within the intestine, with CD103+ and CD103- subsets having 
unique transcriptional profiles and effector functions. Here we identify signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) as an important regulator of 
CD103- Trm differentiation. STAT4-deficient cells trafficked to the intestine 
and localized to areas of infection but displayed impaired Trm differentiation 
with fewer CD103- Trms. Single-cell RNA-sequencing demonstrated that 
STAT4-deficiency led to a reduction in CD103- Trm subsets and expansion of a 
single population of CD103+ cells. Alterations in Trm populations were due, in 
part, to STAT4-mediated inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-driven 
expression of Trm signature genes. STAT4-dependent Trm populations expressed 
genes associated with cytokine production and cell migration, and 
STAT4-deficient Trm cells had altered localization within the tissue and reduced 
effector function after reactivation in vivo. Overall, our data indicate that 
STAT4 leads to increased differentiation of CD103- Trms, in part by modulating 
the expression of TGF-β-regulated genes, and results in increased Trm

(pMHCs) can be used as a therapy to treat autoimmune diseases. They do so by 
inducing the differentiation and expansion of disease-suppressing T regulatory 
type 1 (Tr1) cells by binding to their T cell receptors (TCRs) expressed as 
TCR-nanoclusters (TCRnc). Their efficacy can be controlled by adjusting NP size 
and number of pMHCs coated on them (referred to as valence). The binding of 
these NPs to TCRnc on T cells is thus polyvalent and occurs at three levels: the 
TCR-pMHC, NP-TCRnc and T cell levels. In this study, we explore how this 
polyvalent interaction is manifested and examine if it can facilitate T cell 
activation downstream. This is done by developing a multiscale biophysical model 
that takes into account the three levels of interactions and the geometrical 
complexity of the binding. Using the model, we quantify several key parameters 
associated with this interaction analytically and numerically, including the 
insertion probability that specifies the number of remaining pMHC binding sites 
in the contact area between T cells and NPs, the dwell time of interaction 
between NPs and TCRnc, carrying capacity of TCRnc, the distribution of covered 
and bound TCRs, and cooperativity in the binding of pMHCs within the contact 
area. The model was fit to previously published dose-response curves of 
interferon-γ obtained experimentally by stimulating a population of T cells with 
increasing concentrations of NPs at various valences and NP sizes. Exploring the 
parameter space of the model revealed that for an appropriate choice of the 
contact area angle, the model can produce moderate jumps between dose-response 
curves at low valences. This suggests that the geometry and kinetics of NP 
binding to TCRnc can act in synergy to facilitate T cell activation.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.mbs.2023.108995

human body, regulates a wide range of cellular functions of immune cells, such 
as proliferation, differentiation and survival. Zinc deficiency affects both the 
innate and adaptive immune system. Zinc supplementation was discussed as 
possible therapy for infectious diseases and T cell-mediated autoimmune 
diseases. However, the influence of commercial zinc preparations on 
proliferation and cytokine production of resting and antigen-stimulated 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) has not yet been completely 
investigated.
METHODS: Here, we examined whether zinc aspartate (Unizink®), an approved drug 
to treat zinc deficiency in patients, induces proliferation, cytokine 
production, and induction of apoptosis/caspase 3/7 activity of resting PBMC 
under high-density cell culture condition. In addition, we performed 
antigen-specific proliferation experiments, where PBMCs of healthy donors 
vaccinated against Influenza A (H1N1) and/or SARS-CoV-2 were stimulated with 
Influenza A (H1N1) peptides or SARS-CoV-2 peptides as well as the Mixed 
Lymphocyte Culture (MLC) in the presence of increasing concentrations of zinc 
aspartate.
RESULTS: We observed a dose-dependent enhancement of proliferation and induction 
of cytokine production (IFN-γ, IL-5, GM-CSF and CXCL10) of resting PBMC in 
presence of zinc aspartate. The number of cells with active caspase 3/7 and, 
consecutively, the amount of cells undergoing apoptosis steadily decreased in 
presence of zinc aspartate. Moreover, zinc aspartate was capable of stimulating 
antigen-specific PBMC proliferation using MLC or influenza A (H1N1) and 
SARS-CoV-2 peptides in both a dose-dependent and a donor-specific manner. In the 
absence of zinc aspartate, we clearly could discriminate two groups of 
responders: low and high responders to antigenic stimulation. The addition of 
increasing concentration of zinc aspartate significantly stimulated the 
proliferation of PBMC from low responders, but not from high responders.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that zinc aspartate induces the 
proliferation of resting and antigen-stimulated PBMCs under high-density cell 
culture conditions. Thus, zinc might represent a supportive treatment in 
patients suffering from infectious diseases.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jtemb.2023.127152

inflammatory myeloid neoplasia linked to paediatric neurodegeneration, whereby 
transformed LCH cells form agglomerated lesions in various organs. Although 
MAP-kinase pathway mutations have been identified in LCH cells, the functional 
consequences of these mutations and the mechanisms that cause the pathogenic 
behaviour of LCH cells are not well understood. In our study, we used an in 
vitro differentiation system and RNA-sequencing to compare monocyte-derived 
dendritic cells from LCH patients to those derived from healthy controls or 
patients with Crohn's disease, a non-histiocytic inflammatory disease. We 
observed that Interferon-γ treatment exacerbated intrinsic differences between 
LCH patient and control cells, including strikingly increased endoand exocytosis 
gene activity in LCH patients. We validated these transcriptional patterns in 
lesions and functionally confirmed that LCH cells exhibited increased endo- and 
exocytosis. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing of extracellular vesicles (EV) revealed 
the enrichment of pathological transcripts involved in cell adhesion, MAP-kinase 
pathway, vesicle trafficking and T-cell activation in LCH patients. Thus, we 
tested the effect of the LCH secretome on lymphocyte activity and found 
significant activation of NK cells. These findings implicate EVs in the 
pathology of LCH for the first time, in line with their established roles in the 
formation of various other tumour niches. Thus, we describe novel traits of LCH 
patient cells and suggest a pathogenic mechanism of potential therapeutic and 
diagnostic importance.","DOI: 10.3324/haematol.2022.282638

    Int J Biol Sci. 2023 Feb 23;19(5):1401-1402.","Aim: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer associated death 
worldwide and immune checkpoint blockade therapy only benefit a small set of CRC 
patients. Tumor ferroptosis of CRC reflected immune-activation in our previous 
findings. Understanding the mechanisms underlying how to bolster CD8+ T cells 
function through ferroptosis in CRC tumor microenvironment (TME) will greatly 
benefit cancer immunotherapy. Methods: Genes between ferroptosis and CD8+ T cell 
function in CRC were screened through Cox, WGCNA and differential expression 
analysis. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence analysis were performed. 
Co-immunoprecipitation were performed to determine protein-protein interaction, 
mRNA level was determined by qRT-PCR. RSL3 was used to induce ferroptosis, and 
ferroptosis levels were evaluated by measuring Transmission Electron Microscope 
analysis, MDA, Fe2+level and cell viability. Results: We screened APOL3 as the 
significant modulator for ferroptosis-related CD8+ infiltration in CRC. Next, by 
in vitro and in vivo, we found that increased APOL3 expression was positively 
correlated with sensitivity to ferroptosis and antitumor ability of CD8+ T 
cells. Next, we demonstrated that APOL3 can binds LDHA and promote its 
ubiquitylation-related degradation. Then, based on in vivo analysis and tumor 
specimen, we discovered the APOL3-LDHA axis can facilitate the tumor ferroptosis 
and cytotoxic ability of CD8+ T cells through increased IFNγ and decreased 
lactic acid concentration. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that APOL3 
promotes ferroptosis and immunotherapy in colorectal cancer cells. The present 
work provides us with a novel target to overcome drug resistance to ferroptosis 
and immunotherapy.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/ijbs.74985

placenta, there is a potential possibility of using regulatory elements derived 
from retroviruses and retrotransposons, which are suppressed by DNA methylation 
in the adult body. In addition, there is an abnormal increase in the level of 
methylation of the LINE-1 retrotransposon in the chorionic trophoblast in 
spontaneous abortions with both normal karyotype and aneuploidy on different 
chromosomes, which may be associated with impaired gene transcription using 
LINE-1 regulatory elements. To date, 988 genes that can be expressed from 
alternative LINE-1 promoters have been identified. Using the STRING tool, genes 
(NUP153 and YWHAB) were selected, the products of which have significant 
functional relationships with proteins highly expressed in the placenta and 
involved in trophoblast differentiation. This study aimed to analyze the 
expression of the NUP153 and YWHAB genes, highly active in the placenta, from 
canonical and alternative LINE-1 promoters in the germinal part of the placenta 
of spontaneous and induced abortions. Gene expression analysis was performed 
using real-time PCR in chorionic villi and extraembryonic mesoderm of induced 
abortions (n = 10), adult lymphocytes (n = 10), spontaneous abortions with 
normal karyotype (n = 10), and with the most frequent aneuploidies in the first 
trimester of pregnancy (trisomy 16 (n = 8) and monosomy X (n = 6)). The LINE-1 
methylation index was assessed in the chorionic villi of spontaneous abortions 
using targeted bisulfite massive parallel sequencing. The level of expression of 
both genes from canonical promoters was higher in blood lymphocytes than in 
placental tissues (p < 0.05). However, the expression level of the NUP153 gene 
from the alternative LINE-1 promoter was 17 times higher in chorionic villi and 
23 times higher in extraembryonic mesoderm than in lymphocytes (p < 0.05). The 
expression level of NUP153 and YWHAB from canonical promoters was higher in the 
group of spontaneous abortions with monosomy X compared to all other groups (p 
<0.05). The LINE-1 methylation index negatively correlated with the level of 
gene expression from both canonical (NUP153 - R = -0.59, YWHAB - R = -0.52, p < 
0.05) and alternative LINE-1 promoters (NUP153 - R = -0.46, YWHAB - R = -0.66, p 
< 0.05). Thus, the observed increase in the LINE-1 methylation index in the 
placenta of spontaneous abortions is associated with the level of expression of 
the NUP153 and YWHAB genes not only from alternative but also from canonical 
promoters, which can subsequently lead to negative consequences for normal 
embryogenesis.","Publisher: Для плаценты характерен уникальный гипометилированный геном. 
Благодаря этой особенности плаценты в первом триместре беременности наблюдается 
потенциальная возможность использования регуляторных элементов, полученных от 
ретровирусов и ретротранспозонов, которые во взрослом организме подавляются 
метилированием ДНК. Кроме того, у спонтанных абортусов и с нормальным 
кариотипом, и с анеуплоидиями отмечается аномальное повышение уровня 
метилирования ретротранспозона LINE-1 в трофобласте хориона, что может быть 
связано с нарушением транскрипции генов с использованием регуляторных элементов 
LINE-1. На сегодняшний день идентифицировано 988 генов, способных 
экспрессироваться с альтернативных промоторов LINE-1. Из них с помощью 
инструмента STRING были отобраны гены, продукты которых взаимодействуют с 
белками, экспрессирующимися на высоком уровне в плаценте и участвующими в 
дифференцировке трофобласта, NUP153 и YWHAB. Целью настоящего исследования 
являлся анализ экспрессии генов NUP153 и YWHAB с канонических и альтернативных 
промоторов ретротранспозона LINE-1 в зародышевой части плаценты спонтанных и 
медицинских абортусов первого триместра беременности. Определение уровня 
экспрессии генов проводили с помощью ПЦР в режиме реального времени в лимфоцитах 
взрослых индивидов (n = 10), в ворсинах хориона и экстраэмбриональной мезодерме 
медицинских абортусов (n = 10) и спонтанных абортусов с нормальным кариотипом (n 
= 10) и с наиболее частыми анеуплоидиями в I триместре беременности (трисомия 16 
(n = 8) и моносомия X (n = 6)). Индекс метилирования LINE-1 оценивали в ворсинах 
хориона спонтанных абортусов с помощью таргетного бисульфитного массового 
параллельного секвенирования. Уровень экспрессии обоих генов с канонических 
промоторов был выше в лимфоцитах крови, чем в тканях плаценты (p < 0.05). Однако 
уровень экспрессии гена NUP153 с альтернативного промотора LINE-1 был выше в 17 
раз в ворсинах хориона и в 23 раза – в экстраэмбриональной мезодерме по 
сравнению с лимфоцитами (p < 0.05). Между группами спонтанных абортусов с 
моносомией X и остальными группами были выявлены статистически значимые 
различия. Уровень экспрессии NUP153 и YWHAB с канонических промоторов был выше в 
группе спонтанных абортусов с моносомией X по сравнению со всеми другими 
группами (p < 0.05). Индекс метилирования LINE-1 отрицательно коррелировал с 
уровнем экспрессии генов как c канонических (NUP153 – R = –0.59, YWHAB – R = 
–0.52, p < 0.05), так и c альтернативных промоторов LINE-1 (NUP153 – R = –0.46, 
YWHAB – R = –0.66, p < 0.05). Таким образом, наблюдаемое нами повышение индекса 
метилирования LINE-1 в плаценте спонтанных абортусов связано с уровнем 
экспрессии генов NUP153 и YWHAB не только с альтернативных, но и с канонических 
промоторов, что в дальнейшем может приводить к негативным последствиям для 
нормального эмбриогенеза.",Copyright © AUTHORS.,"DOI: 10.18699/VJGB-23-09

infected or mutated cells. They often traverse varying oxygen levels and 
nutrient-deprived microenvironments. High glycolytic activity in local tissues 
can result in significant exposure of cytotoxic T cells to the lactate 
metabolite. Lactate has been known to act as an immunosuppressor, at least in 
part due to its association with tissue acidosis.
METHODS: To dissect the role of the lactate anion, independently of pH, we 
performed phenotypical and metabolic assays, high-throughput RNA sequencing, and 
mass spectrometry, on primary cultures of murine or human CD8+ T cells exposed 
to high doses of pH-neutral sodium lactate.
RESULTS: The lactate anion is well tolerated by CD8+ T cells in pH neutral 
conditions. We describe how lactate is taken up by activated CD8+ T cells and 
can displace glucose as a carbon source. Activation in the presence of sodium 
lactate significantly alters the CD8+ T cell transcriptome, including the 
expression key effector differentiation markers such as granzyme B and 
interferon-gamma.
DISCUSSION: Our studies reveal novel metabolic features of lactate utilization 
by activated CD8+ T cells, and highlight the importance of lactate in shaping 
the differentiation and activity of cytotoxic T cells.","Copyright © 2023 Barbieri, Veliça, Gameiro, Cunha, Foskolou, Rullman, Bargiela,

an uncommon histologic type of invasive breast carcinoma. It is associated with 
high-grade, poorly differentiated tumor cells that form large sheets of 
irregular confluent tumor cells associated with a prominent lymphocytic 
infiltrate. Patients with IBC-NST with medullary pattern are often 
postmenopausal women with a high body mass index and multiparity. We report the

ultimately diagnosed as IBC-NST with medullary pattern, and radiologic imaging 
(particularly ultrasound and mammography) along with pathology review were 
critical in making the diagnosis. We make the case of the importance of 
radiographic imaging in diagnosing this condition, as the prognosis of IBC-NST 
with medullary pattern is typically more favorable compared to IBC-NST.","© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of University of

mechanisms and clinical impact have been obscure. We obtained two tumor samples 
from lymph node (LN) metastatic lesions in a same patient. Whole exome 
sequencing for the both tumors and single-cell sequencing for the both 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) demonstrated a significant difference in 
tumor clonality and TILs' characteristics, especially exhausted T-cell 
clonotypes, although a close relationship between the tumor cell and T-cell 
clones were observed as a response of an overlapped exhausted T-cell clone to an 
overlapped neoantigen. To mimic the clinical setting, we generated a mouse model 
of several clones from a same tumor cell line. Similarly, differential tumor 
clones harbored distinct TILs, and one responded to programmed cell death 
protein 1 (PD-1) blockade but the other did not in this model. We further 
conducted cohort study (n = 503) treated with PD-1 blockade monotherapies to 
investigate the outcome of mixed response. Patients with mixed responses to PD-1 
blockade had a poor prognosis in our cohort. Particularly, there were 
significant differences in both tumor and T-cell clones between the primary and 
LN lesions in a patient who experienced tumor response to anti-PD-1 mAb followed 
by disease progression in only LN metastasis. Our results underscore that 
intertumoral heterogeneity alters characteristics of TILs even in the same 
patient, leading to mixed response to immunotherapy and significant difference 
in the outcome.
SIGNIFICANCE: Several patients experience mixed responses to immunotherapies, 
but the biological mechanisms and clinical significance remain unclear. Our

activity against B-cell cancers. While second-generation CARs induce complete 
remission in >80% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, similar 
monotherapy induces long-term remissions in only 26% of patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This disparity is attributed to cell-intrinsic 
effector defects in autologous CLL-derived T cells. However, the mechanisms by 
which leukemic cells impact CAR T-cell potency are poorly understood. Herein we 
describe an in vitro assay that recapitulates endogenous CLL-mediated T-cell 
defects in healthy donor CAR T cells. Contact with CLL cells insufficiently 
activates, but does not irreversibly impair, CAR T-cell function. This state is 
rescuable by strong antigenic stimulation or IL2, and is not driven by immune 
suppression. Rather, this activation defect is attributable to low levels of 
costimulatory molecules on CLL cells, and exogenous costimulation enhanced CAR 
T-cell activation. We next assessed the stimulatory phenotype of CLL cells 
derived from different niches within the same patient. Lymph node (LN)-derived 
CLL cells had a strong costimulatory phenotype and promoted better CAR T-cell 
degranulation and cytokine production than matched peripheral blood CLL cells. 
Finally, in vitro CD40L-activated CLL cells acquired a costimulatory phenotype 
similar to the LN-derived tumor and stimulated improved CAR T-cell 
proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity. Together, these data 
identify insufficient activation as a driver of poor CAR T-cell responses in 
CLL. The costimulatory phenotype of CLL cells drives differential CAR T-cell 
responses, and can be augmented by improving costimulatory signaling.
SIGNIFICANCE: CLL cells insufficiently activate CAR T cells, driven by low 
levels of costimulatory molecules on the tumor. LN-derived CLL cells are more 
costimulatory and mediate enhanced CAR T-cell killing. This costimulatory 
phenotype can be modeled via CD40 L activation, and the activated tumor promotes 
stronger CAR T-cell responses.",© 2022 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-22-0200

neonates, with less severity in older children. Previous studies demonstrated 
that the DNA of CD4+ T cells in the mouse lung, whose primary responsibility is 
to coordinate the immune response to foreign pathogens, is differentially 
methylated in neonates compared with juveniles. Nevertheless, the effect of this 
differential DNA methylation on CD4+ T cell gene expression and response to 
infection remains unclear. Here we treated E. coli-infected neonatal (4-day-old) 
and juvenile (13-day-old) mice with decitabine (DAC), a DNA methyltransferase 
inhibitor with broad-spectrum DNA demethylating activity, and performed 
simultaneous genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptional profiling on lung 
CD4+ T cells. We show that juvenile and neonatal mice experienced differential 
demethylation in response to DAC treatment, with larger methylation differences 
observed in neonates. By cross-filtering differentially expressed genes between 
juveniles and neonates with those sites that were demethylated in neonates, we 
find that interferon-responsive genes such as Ifit1 are the most down-regulated 
methylation-sensitive genes in neonatal mice. DAC treatment shifted neonatal 
lung CD4+ T cells toward a gene expression program similar to that of juveniles. 
Following lung infection with E. coli, lung CD4+ T cells in neonatal mice 
exhibit epigenetic repression of important host defense pathways, which are 
activated by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity to resemble a more 
mature profile.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-31285-5

products and their consumption has increased substantially over the past years1. 
Although generally regarded as safe, some concerns have been raised about the 
long-term safety of the consumption of certain sweeteners2-5. In this study, we 
show that the intake of high doses of sucralose in mice results in 
immunomodulatory effects by limiting T cell proliferation and T cell 
differentiation. Mechanistically, sucralose affects the membrane order of T 
cells, accompanied by a reduced efficiency of T cell receptor signalling and 
intracellular calcium mobilization. Mice given sucralose show decreased CD8+ T 
cell antigen-specific responses in subcutaneous cancer models and bacterial 
infection models, and reduced T cell function in models of T cell-mediated 
autoimmunity. Overall, these findings suggest that a high intake of sucralose 
can dampen T cell-mediated responses, an effect that could be used in therapy to 
mitigate T cell-dependent autoimmune disorders.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-05801-6

hematopoietic stem cells are determined by transcription factors specific to 
each of them. The commitment factors assist in the differentiation of progenitor 
cells into terminally differentiated cells. B lymphocytes constitute a 
population of cells that expresses clonally diverse cell surface immunoglobulin 
(Ig) receptors specific to antigenic epitopes. B cells are a significant facet 
of the adaptive immune system. The secreted antibodies corresponding to the B 
cell recognize the antigens via the B cell receptor (BCR). Following antigen 
recognition, the B cell is activated and thereafter undergoes clonal expansion 
and proliferation to become memory B cells. The essence of 'cellular 
reprogramming' has aided in reliably altering the cells to desired tissue type. 
The potential of reprogramming has been harnessed to decipher and find solutions 
for various genetically inherited diseases and degenerative disorders. B 
lymphocytes can be reprogrammed to their initial naive state from where they get 
differentiated into any lineage or cell type similar to a pluripotent stem cell 
which can be accomplished by the deletion of master regulators of the B cell 
lineage. B cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells and also can 
undergo transdifferentiation at the midway of cell differentiation to other cell 
types. Mandated expression of C/EBP in specialized B cells corresponds to their 
fast and effective reprogramming into macrophages, reversing the cell fate of 
these lymphocytes and allowing them to differentiate freshly into other types of 
cells. The co-expression of C/EBPα and OKSM (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) amplified 
the reprogramming efficiency of B lymphocytes. Various human somatic cells 
including the immune cells are compliant to reprogramming which paves a path for 
opportunities like autologous tissue grafts, blood transfusion, and cancer 
immunotherapy. The ability to reprogram B cells offers an unprecedented 
opportunity for developing a therapeutic approach for several human diseases. 
Here, we will focus on all the proteins and transcription factors responsible 
for the developmental commitment of B lymphocytes and how it is harnessed in 
various applications.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.trim.2023.101804

therapeutic potential in a wide range of diseases. However, the development of 
integrin targeting medications has been impacted by unexpected downstream 
effects, reflecting originally unforeseen interference with the bidirectional 
signalling and cross-communication of integrins. We here selected one of the 
most severely affected target integrins, the integrin lymphocyte 
function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1, αLβ2, CD11a/CD18), as a prototypic 
integrin to systematically assess and overcome these known shortcomings. We 
employed a two-tiered ligand-based virtual screening approach to identify a 
novel class of allosteric small molecule inhibitors targeting this integrin's αI 
domain. The newly discovered chemical scaffold was derivatized, yielding potent 
bis-and tris-aryl-bicyclic-succinimides which inhibit LFA-1 in vitro at low 
nanomolar concentrations. The characterisation of these compounds in comparison 
to earlier LFA-1 targeting modalities established that the allosteric LFA-1 
inhibitors (i) are devoid of partial agonism, (ii) selectively bind LFA-1 versus 
other integrins, (iii) do not trigger internalization of LFA-1 itself or other 
integrins and (iv) display oral availability. This profile differentiates the 
new generation of allosteric LFA-1 inhibitors from previous ligand mimetic-based 
LFA-1 inhibitors and anti-LFA-1 antibodies, and is projected to support novel 
immune regulatory regimens selectively targeting the integrin LFA-1. The 
rigorous computational and experimental assessment schedule described here is 
designed to be adaptable to the preclinical discovery and development of novel 
allosterically acting compounds targeting integrins other than LFA-1, providing 
an exemplary approach for the early characterisation of next generation integrin

neoadjuvant therapy have been applied to the treatment of esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the optimal regimen needs to be further 
explored, particularly for older patients, and the mechanisms by which the 
immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy modulates the evolution 
of ESCC are unknown.
METHODS: In this single-arm phase 2 trial, patients with resectable (stage 
II/III/IV without metastasis) ESCC were enrolled and received nanoparticle 
albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel for two cycles and oral S-1 for 2 weeks, combined 
with intravenous toripalimab for two cycles before surgery. Combination 
postoperative adjuvant therapy was administered. The primary outcome was the 
major pathological response (MPR). Secondary outcomes included pathological 
complete response (pCR), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate 
(DCR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), improvement in 
Stooler's dysphagia score and degree of daily living ability (dADL). Biopsies 
and plasma pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy were performed using whole-exome 
sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PD-L1, 
multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and proximity extension assay technology 
(PEA) for 92 proteins.
FINDINGS: From November 2019 to July 2021, 60 patients were enrolled. After 
neoadjuvant therapy, R0 resection was achieved in 55 (98.21%) patients. MPR was 
identified in 27 patients (49.09%), and 16 patients (29.09%) achieved pCR. 
Patients with PR, SD and PD were 37 (61.67%), 21 (35.00%) and 2 (3.33%), 
respectively. The overall staging, Stooler dysphagia scores and dADL were 
significantly decreased after treatment. 11 patients (18.3%) experienced grade 
≥3 AEs. Compared to PD-L1-Low patients, PD-L1-High patients had a significantly 
higher ratio of PR. During therapy, the tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor 
neoantigen burden (TNB) were significantly decreased in patients with PR. 
Differential clonal evolution within tumors was demonstrated by analysis of 
intratumoral heterogeneity. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the 
infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes at baseline was associated with clinical 
outcome. During therapy, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells were increased in all 
patients; however, exhausted cells, nTregs and iTregs were significantly 
increased in patients with non-MPR. Protein analyses revealed that the levels of 
IFN-γ, Gal.1 and LAMP3 can predict the clinical benefit. In addition, the 
expression of CD83, TNFRSF4, TNFSF14, VEGFR2, ADA, ARG1, and HO-1 was associated 
with serious AEs. More importantly, the integration of CD4+ T cells with plasma 
protein of IFN-γ, Gal.1 or LAMP3 could further distinguish responders from 
non-responders.
INTERPRETATION: In this study, neoadjuvant therapy with toripalimab, 
nab-paclitaxel and S-1 was less toxic and showed promising antitumor activity in 
patients with resectable ESCC. Changes in the genome, transcriptome, PD-L1 
expression and serum proteins were comprehensively analyzed and correlated with 
clinical outcomes, which provides insight into the mechanism of action of 
toripalimab combined with nab-paclitaxel and S-1 in patients with ESCC.

cells (pre-LSCs) and subsequent leukemogenesis, both of which are profoundly 
inhibited by restoration of thymic competition or expression of the 
antiapoptotic factor BCL2. Genomic analyses revealed the presence of Notch1 
mutations in pre-LSCs before subsequent loss of tumor suppressors promotes the 
transition to overt leukemogenesis. These studies demonstrate a critical role

by inducing alterations in immune cells. As macrophages and innate lymphoid 
cells (ILCs) are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-related 
asthma, we tested our hypothesis that altered glutamine metabolism may link 
obesity to airway hyperresponsivenss (AHR), a cardinal feature of asthma, 
focusing on these innate immune cells. Four-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed 
a high-fat diet (HFD) for 13 wk in the presence or absence of BPTES 
[Bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide, a selective 
inhibitor of glutaminase 1 which converts glutamine to glutamate] and their 
blood, lung, and adipose tissues were analyzed. We then conducted in vitro 
experiments using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and mouse alveolar 
macrophage cell line. Furthermore, we investigated plasma glutamine and 
glutamate levels in obese and nonobese asthmatics. BPTES treatment prevented 
HFD-induced AHR and significantly decreased IL-1β+ classically activated 
macrophages (M1s) and type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) which increased in the lungs of 
HFD-fed obese mice. In in vitro experiments, BPTES treatment or glutamine 
supplement significantly reduced the proportion of IL-1β+NLRP3+ M1s in 
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMDMs and mouse alveolar macrophage cell line. 
BPTES treatment also significantly reduced the IL-17 producing ILC3s 
differentiated from ILCs in naïve mouse lung. In addition, plasma 
glutamate/glutamine ratios were significantly higher in obese asthmatics 
compared to nonobese asthmatics. Inhibition of glutaminolysis reverses AHR in 
HFD-induced obese mice and decreases IL-1β + NLRP3+ M1s and IL-17 producing 
ILC3s, which suggests altered glutamine metabolism may have a role in the 
pathogenesis of obesity-related AHR.","DOI: 10.1152/ajplung.00181.2022

(#)Contributed equally","CD4 T cells are required, along with antibodies, for complete protection from 
blood-stage infection with Plasmodium spp., which cause malaria. Without 
continuous exposure, as on emigration of people from endemic areas, protection 
from malaria decays. As in other persistent infections, low-level Plasmodium 
chabaudi infection protects the host from reinfection at 2 months postinfection, 
a phenomenon termed premunition. Premunition is correlated with T cell 
responses, rather than antibody levels. We previously showed that while both 
effector T cells (Teff) and memory T cells (Tmem) are present after infection, 
Teff protect better than Tmem. Here, we studied T cell kinetics post-infection 
by labeling dividing Ifng+ T cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in 
infected Ifng reporter mice. Large drops in specific T cell numbers and Ifng+ 
cells upon clearance of parasites suggest a mechanism for decay of protection. 
Although protection decays, CD4 Tmem persist, including a highly differentiated 
CD27- effector memory (Tem) subset that maintains some Ifng expression. In 
addition, pretreatment of chronically infected animals with neutralizing 
antibody to interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or with clodronate liposomes before 
reinfection decreases premunition, supporting a role for Th1-type immunity to 
reinfection. A pulse-chase experiment comparing chronically infected to treated 
animals showed that recently divided Ifng+ T cells, particularly IFN-γ+ TNF+ 
IL-2- T cells, are promoted by persistent infection. These data suggest that 
low-level persistent infection reduces CD4+ Tmem and multifunctional Teff 
survival, but promotes IFN-γ+ TNF+ IL-2- T cells and Ifng+ terminally 
differentiated effector T cells, and prolongs immunity.","DOI: 10.1128/iai.00531-22

HIV-infected MSM and HIV-uninfected MSM (healthy controls, HC) in Guangzhou, 
June-October 2021. HIV-infected MSM were grouped into good immunological 
responders (GIR) (CD4 + T cell count ≥ 350 cells/μL) and poor immunological 
responders (PIR) (<350 cells/μL). Blood and stool samples were collected. 
Microbial translocation in serum was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing was performed on stool 
samples, and microbial metabolites were obtained through gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. 56 GIR, 41 PIR, and 51 HC were included. Microbial translocation 
marker soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14) in both GIR and PIR groups 
was significantly higher than that in HC. Compared with PIR or HC groups, the 
genera of Coprococcus, Blautia, Clostridium, and SMB53 were decreased, whereas 
Megamonas and Megasphaera were more abundant in GIR group. Compared with GIR or 
PIR groups, Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Faecalibacterium, Oscillospira, and 
Roseburia were more abundant, whereas Escherichia was decreased in HC group. The 
levels of benzenoids, imidazoles, phenylpropanoic acids, phenylpropanoids, and

(1)Shiro Niiyama, MD, PhD Department of Dermatology, Toho University Ohashi 
Medical Center Ohashi, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan sniiyama@aol.com.","Dear Editor,Mammary Paget's disease (MPD) is an adenocarcinoma localized within 
the epidermis of the nipple and/or the areola of the breast, and it is as a rule 
associated with a carcinoma of the underlying lactiferous ducts, where it 
usually starts. MPD is relatively rare, observed in 0.7-4.3% of all breast 
cancers (1). We present a patient with MPD and atypical clinical finding as an 
annular plaque. A 74-year-old Japanese woman with a past medical history of 
hypothyroidism presented with a 6-month history of an itching plaque on the left 
areola. The patient had been treated with the application of topical steroids 
for a duration of approximately 5 months, and showed no clinical improvement. 
Physical examination showed a pink plaque encircling the nipple on the left 
areola (Figure 1, a). The right nipple and areola appeared normal (Figure 1, b). 
No palpable masses were detected within either breast. A 3.5 mm punch biopsy of 
the skin at the 6 o'clock position of the left areola was performed. 
Histological examination showed single and small aggregations of atypical cells 
with large hyperchromatic nuclei and pale-staining, ample cytoplasm throughout 
the epidermis. There was a lymphocytic infiltration in the dermis (Figure 1, c). 
Immunohistochemical studies were positive for CK7 and negative for S-100 and 
HMB45. With the diagnosis of MPD, the patient underwent a partial mastectomy of 
the left breast center area, consisting of surgical excision of the left nipple, 
the adjacent surrounding areolar skin, and subcutaneous tissues. Subsequently, 
radiation therapy for the residual breast was prepared. As has been described in 
detail by Kanitakis, the skin lesion develops insidiously as a scaly, fissured, 
or oozing erythema of the nipple and, more rarely, the areola. Advanced lesions 
present as a well-demarcated, round, ovoid, or polycyclic eczema-like plaque 
with a pink or red hue. It is occasionally slightly infiltrated and has an 
erosive, oozing, scaly, or crusted surface. The lesions are almost invariably 
unilateral, showing centrifugal spread. Retraction or ulceration of the nipple 
are often noted (1). The present case exhibited a very rare clinical finding of 
a plaque encircling the nipple, which has not been reported previously. It was 
initially difficult to establish the diagnosis of MPD, and biopsy was needed to 
obtain a definitive diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of MPD comprises eczema as 
atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, erosive adenomatosis, and malignant 
skin condition such as Bowen's disease, superficial basal cell carcinoma, or 
superficially spreading melanoma. As in the present case, individuals presenting 
with an annular plaque are often considered to have sebaceous hyperplasia. 
Sebaceous hyperplasia is a common, benign skin condition involving hypertrophy 
of the sebaceous glands, common in middle-aged or older adults (2). These 
lesions can be single or multiple and manifest as yellow, soft, small papules. 
These papules are occasionally seen around the nipple, forming an annular 
plaque. In general, sebaceous hyperplasia is described as yellow-colored papules 
among Caucasians. However, caution is needed, since it is characterized by 
skin-colored papules among some Asians.In the present case, some pigmentation (2 
to 3 mm in diameter) was observed on the left nipple. Pigmented MPD have been 
reported, and the mechanism underlying the pigmentation is not yet fully 
understood, but it has been proposed that Paget cells may release melanocytic 
chemoattractants or basic fibroblast growth factors that stimulate the 
proliferation of melanocytes within the tumor nests (3). The possibility of 
physiological pigmentation cannot be ruled out in the present case; on the other 
hand, the possibility of pigmented MPD cannot be ruled out either, since no 
pigmentation was observed on the right nipple.",PMID: 36919395 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

life-threatening conditions triggered by multiple intra- and extra-pulmonary 
injury factors, characterized by complicated molecular mechanisms and high 
mortality. Great strides have been made in the field of immunometabolism to 
clarify the interplay between intracellular metabolism and immune function in 
the past few years. Emerging evidence unveils the crucial roles of 
immunometabolism in inflammatory response and ALI. During ALI, both macrophages 
and lymphocytes undergo robust metabolic reprogramming and discrete epigenetic 
changes after activated. Apart from providing ATP and biosynthetic precursors, 
these metabolic cellular reactions and processes in lung also regulate 
inflammation and immunity.In fact, metabolic reprogramming involving glucose 
metabolism and fatty acidoxidation (FAO) acts as a double-edged sword in 
inflammatory response, which not only drives inflammasome activation but also 
elicits anti-inflammatory response. Additionally, the features and roles of 
metabolic reprogramming in different immune cells are not exactly the same. 
Here, we outline the evidence implicating how adverse factors shape 
immunometabolism in differentiation types of immune cells during ALI and 
summarize key proteins associated with energy expenditure and metabolic 
reprogramming. Finally, novel therapeutic targets in metabolic intermediates and 
enzymes together with current challenges in immunometabolism against ALI were

microbes in the gut for their development. However, how microbial adherence to 
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) promotes Th17 cell differentiation remains 
enigmatic. Here, we found that Th17 cell-inducing gut bacteria generated an 
unfolded protein response (UPR) in IECs. Furthermore, subtilase cytotoxin 
expression or genetic removal of X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) in IECs caused a 
UPR and increased Th17 cells, even in antibiotic-treated or germ-free 
conditions. Mechanistically, UPR activation in IECs enhanced their production of 
both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and purine metabolites. Treating mice with 
N-acetyl-cysteine or allopurinol to reduce ROS production and xanthine, 
respectively, decreased Th17 cells that were associated with an elevated UPR. 
Th17-related genes also correlated with ER stress and the UPR in humans with 
inflammatory bowel disease. Overall, we identify a mechanism of intestinal Th17

Stat5-dependent recruitment of Ets1-Runx1 factors to Th1- and Treg-cell-specific

and its regulatory mechanism is poorly elucidated. Here, we show that the gut 
microbiota is associated with the development of bursal B cells in young 
chickens. Changing patterns of both the alpha diversity and the expression of 
the B cell marker Bu-1α in the gut microbiota were related to the ages of 
chickens at different growth phases. Further correlation analysis revealed the 
marked correlation between the relative abundances of Intestinimonas, Bilophila, 
Parasutterella, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Campylobacter, and Mucispirillum and 
the expression of Bu-1α. In antibiotic-treated chickens, BF and B cell 
development had aberrations as the relative abundance of the microbiota in early 
life decreased. These findings were consistent with Spearman's correlation 
results. Single-cell transcriptome analysis indicated that the heterogeneity in 
the cellular composition and developmental trajectory of bursal B cells from 
antibiotic-treated chickens was large. We found a novel subpopulation of unnamed 
B cells and identified Taf1 as a new pivotal regulator of B cell lineage 
differentiation. Therefore, we provide novel insights into the regulatory role 
of the gut microbiota in B cell development in early life and the maturation of 
host humoral immunity. IMPORTANCE In this study, we used young broilers to 
investigate the relationship between their gut microbiota and bursal B cell 
development. We characterized the important variables, microbes, B cells, and 
immunoglobulins during the posthatch development of birds. We also identified 
several candidate taxa in the cecal contents associated with B cells. Our study 
provides a rich resource and cell-cell cross talk model supporting B cell 
differentiation from the bursa in vitro at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, 
we determined a new pivotal regulator (Taf1) of B cell differentiation. We 
believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature 
because our findings may elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in B cell 
differentiation. This study also serves as a basis for developing new strategies 
that modulate B cell differentiation to prevent diseases.","DOI: 10.1128/spectrum.04799-22

biomarkers for development of compounds targeting GBA1-associated Parkinson's 
disease (GBA-PD).
OBJECTIVES: Assessing variability of various glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in 
plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) across GBA-PD, idiopathic PD (iPD), and healthy volunteers (HVs).
METHODS: Data from five studies were combined. Variability was assessed of 
glucosylceramide (various isoforms), lactosylceramide (various isoforms), 
glucosylsphingosine, galactosylsphingosine, GCase activity (using fluorescent 
4-methylumbeliferryl-β-glucoside), and GCase protein (using enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay) in plasma, PBMCs, and CSF if available, in GBA-PD, iPD, and 
HVs. GSLs in leukocyte subtypes were compared in HVs. Principal component 
analysis was used to explore global patterns in GSLs, clinical characteristics 
(Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part 3 
[MDS-UPDRS-3], Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], GBA1 mutation type), and 
participant status (GBA-PD, iPD, HVs).
RESULTS: Within-subject between-day variability ranged from 5.8% to 44.5% and 
was generally lower in plasma than in PBMCs. Extracellular glucosylceramide 
levels (plasma) were slightly higher in GBA-PD compared with both iPD and HVs, 
while intracellular levels were comparable. GSLs in the different matrices 
(plasma, PBMCs, CSF) did not correlate. Both lactosylceramide and 
glucosylsphingosine were more abundant in granulocytes compared with monocytes 
and lymphocytes. Absolute levels of GSL isoforms differed greatly. GBA1 mutation 
types could not be differentiated based on GSL data.
CONCLUSIONS: Glucosylceramide can stably be measured over days in both plasma 
and PBMCs and may be used as a biomarker in clinical trials targeting GBA-PD. 
Glucosylsphingosine and lactosylceramide are stable in plasma but are strongly 
affected by leukocyte subtypes in PBMCs. GBA-PD could be differentiated from iPD 
and HVs, primarily based on glucosylceramide levels in plasma. © 2023 The

LINC00632 and Th1/Th2 balance, and the clinical value of LINC00632 in AR 
patients.
METHODS: In total, 120 AR patients, 20 non-atopic obstructive snoring patients 
as disease controls (DCs), and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Their 
LINC00632 expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by 
RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: LINC00632 expression was declined in AR patients compared with DCs and 
HCs (both P ˂ 0.001). Moreover, LINC00632 could distinguish AR patients from DCs 
with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.795 (95% confidence interval [CI]:

0.001) and interleukin (IL)-4 (P = 0.010) in AR patients. Besides, LINC00632 was 
negatively related to rhinorrhea score (P = 0.019), itching score (P = 0.008), 
sneezing score (P = 0.004), and total nasal symptom score (TNSS) (P ˂ 0.001),

node metastasis and to determine whether the preoperative neutrophil and 
lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet and lymphocyte ratio (PLR) can be used 
as the indicators of gastric cancer lymph node metastasis.
METHODS: The pathological data of 221 patients with gastric cancer were 
retrospectively analyzed, and the risk factors of lymph node metastasis were 
evaluated. The relationship between preoperative NLR and PLR and the clinical 
pathology of patients were analyzed, and the effect of these two indexes on

RESULTS: Lymph node metastasis correlated with tumor diameter, depth of 
invasion, Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage, preoperative NLR and preoperative 
PLR (all P<0.05), but not with gender, age and tumor location (all P>0.05). 
According to the result of multivariate analysis, the degree of differentiation, 
depth of invasion, TNM staging and NLR were independent risk factors for GC

CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of PLR, tumor staging and tumor size

pathogenesis has prompted investigations into metabolic rewiring and the 
involvement of mitochondrial metabolism as a driver of disease through NLRP3 
inflammasome activation, disruption of mitochondrial DNA maintenance, and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The use of Agilent Seahorse Technology to 
gain functional in situ metabolic insights of selected cell types from SLE 
patients has identified key parameters that are dysregulated during disease. 
Mitochondrial functional assessments specifically can detect dysfunction through 
oxygen consumption rate (OCR), spare respiratory capacity, and maximal 
respiration measurements, which, when coupled with disease activity scores could 
show potential as markers of disease activity. CD4+ and CD8 + T cells have been 
assessed in this way and show that oxygen consumption rate, spare respiratory 
capacity, and maximal respiration are blunted in CD8 + T cells, with results not 
being as clear cut in CD4 + T cells. Additionally, glutamine, processed by 
mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation is emerging as a key role player 
in the expansion and differentiation of Th1, Th17, ϒδ T cells, and plasmablasts. 
The role that circulating leukocytes play in acting as bioenergetic biomarkers 
of diseases such as diabetes suggests that this may also be a tool to detect 
preclinical SLE. Therefore, the metabolic characterization of immune cell 
subsets and the collection of metabolic data during interventions is also 
essential. The delineation of the metabolic tuning of immune cells in this way 
could lead to novel strategies in treating metabolically demanding processes

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Cellular immunotherapies for cancer represent a means by which a 
patient's immune system can be augmented with high numbers of tumor-specific T 
cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy involves genetic engineering to 
'redirect' peripheral T cells to tumor targets, showing remarkable potency in 
blood cancers. However, due to several resistance mechanisms, CAR-T cell 
therapies remain ineffective in solid tumors. We and others have shown the tumor 
microenvironment harbors a distinct metabolic landscape that produces a barrier 
to immune cell function. Further, altered differentiation of T cells within 
tumors induces defects in mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in severe 
cell-intrinsic metabolic deficiencies. While we and others have shown murine T 
cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic cells can be improved through enhanced 
mitochondrial biogenesis, we sought to determine whether human CAR-T cells could 
be enabled through a metabolic reprogramming approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-EGFR CAR-T cells were infused in NSG mice which bore 
A549 tumors. The tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were analyzed for exhaustion and 
metabolic deficiencies. Lentiviruses carrying PPAR-gamma coactivator 1α 
(PGC-1α), PGC-1αS571A and NT-PGC-1α constructs were used to co-transduce T cells 
with anti-EGFR CAR lentiviruses. We performed metabolic analysis via flow 
cytometry and Seahorse analysis in vitro as well as RNA sequencing. Finally, we 
treated therapeutically A549-carrying NSG mice with either PGC-1α or NT-PGC-1α 
anti-EGFR CAR-T cells. We also analyzed the differences in the 
tumor-infiltrating CAR-T cells when PGC-1α is co-expressed.
RESULTS: Here, in this study, we show that an inhibition resistant, engineered 
version of PGC-1α, can metabolically reprogram human CAR-T cells. Transcriptomic 
profiling of PGC-1α-transduced CAR-T cells showed this approach effectively 
induced mitochondrial biogenesis, but also upregulated programs associated with 
effector functions. Treatment of immunodeficient animals bearing human solid 
tumors with these cells resulted in substantially improved in vivo efficacy. In 
contrast, a truncated version of PGC-1α, NT-PGC-1α, did not improve the in vivo 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data further support a role for metabolic reprogramming in 
immunomodulatory treatments and highlight the utility of genes like PGC-1α as 
attractive candidates to include in cargo along with chimeric receptors or TCRs 
for cell therapy of solid tumors.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

immune-related diseases in humans and immune system dysfunction in wildlife. 
Phthalates are a group of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) suspected to 
influence the immune system. The aim of this study was to characterize the 
persistent effects on leukocytes in the blood and spleen, as well as plasma 
cytokine and growth factor levels, one week after the end of five weeks of oral 
treatment with dibutyl phthalate (DBP; 10 or 100 mg/kg/d) in adult male mice. 
Flow cytometry analysis of the blood revealed that DBP exposure decreased the 
total leukocyte count, classical monocyte and T helper (Th) populations, whereas 
it increased the non-classical monocyte population compared to the vehicle 
control (corn oil). Immunofluorescence analysis of the spleen showed increased 
CD11b+Ly6G+ (marker of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells; 
PMN-MDSCs), and CD43+staining (marker of non-classical monocytes), whereas CD3+ 
(marker of total T cells) and CD4+ (marker of Th cells) staining decreased. To 
investigate the mechanisms of action, levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines 
were measured using multiplexed immunoassays and other key factors were analyzed 
using western blotting. The observed increase in M-CSF levels and the activation 
of STAT3 may promote PMN-MDSC expansion and activity. Increased ARG1, NOX2 
(gp91phox), and protein nitrotyrosine levels, as well as GCN2 and 
phosphor-eIRFα, suggest that oxidative stress and lymphocyte arrest drive the 
lymphocyte suppression caused by PMN-MDSCs. The plasma levels of IL-21 (promotes 
the differentiation of Th cells) and MCP-1 (regulates migration and infiltration 
of monocytes/macrophages) also decreased. These findings show that adult DBP 
exposure can cause persistent immunosuppressive effects, which may increase 
susceptibility to infections, cancers, and immune diseases, and decrease vaccine 
efficacy.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162741

long-term effectiveness of vaccines. When the protective antibodies circulating 
in the blood wane, memory B cells (MBC) can be rapidly reactivated and 
differentiated into antibody-secreting cells during a new infection. Such MBC 
responses are considered to be key in providing long-term protection after 
infection or vaccination. Here, we describe the optimization and qualification 
of a FluoroSpot assay to measure MBCs directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein in the peripheral blood, for use in COVID-19 vaccine trials.
METHODS: We developed a FluoroSpot assay enabling simultaneous enumeration of B 
cells secreting IgA or IgG spike-specific antibodies after polyclonal 
stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with interleukin-2 and 
the toll-like receptor agonist R848 for 5 days. The antigen coating was 
optimized using a capture antibody directed against the spike subunit-2 
glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to immobilize recombinant trimeric spike protein onto 
the membrane.
RESULTS: Compared to a direct spike protein coating, the addition of a capture 
antibody increased the number and the quality of detected spots for both 
spike-specific IgA and IgG secreting cells in PBMCs from COVID-19 convalescents. 
The qualification showed good sensitivity of the dual-color IgA-IgG FluoroSpot 
assay, with lower limits of quantitation of 18 background-subtracted (BS) 
antibody-secreting cells (ASCs)/well for spike-specific IgA and IgG responses. 
Linearity was demonstrated at values ranging from 18 to 73 and from 18 to 607 BS 
ASCs/well for spike-specific IgA and IgG, respectively, as was precision, with 
intermediate precision (percentage geometric coefficients of variation) of 12% 
and 26% for the proportion of spike-specific IgA and IgG MBCs (ratio 
specific/total IgA or Ig). The assay was specific, since no spike-specific MBCs 
were detected in PBMCs from pre-pandemic samples; the results were below the 
limit of detection of 17 BS ASCs/well.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the dual-color IgA-IgG FluoroSpot provides 
a sensitive, specific, linear, and precise tool to detect spike-specific MBC 
responses. This MBC FluoroSpot assay is a method of choice for monitoring 
spike-specific IgA and IgG MBC responses induced by COVID-19 candidate vaccines

and cancer and contribute to autoimmunity and transplant rejection. 
Understanding how they are generated and maintained in the context of infection 
or vaccination holds promise to improve current immune-based therapies. At the 
beginning of any immune response, naïve T cells are activated and differentiate 
into cells with effector function capabilities. In the context of infection, 
most of these cells die once the pathogenic antigen has been cleared. Only a few 
of them persist and differentiate into memory T cells. These memory T cells are 
essential to host immunity because they are long-lived and can perform effector 
functions immediately upon re-infection. How a cell becomes a memory T cell and 
continues being one for months and even years past the initial infection is 
still not fully understood. Recent reviews have thoroughly discussed the 
transcriptional, epigenomic, and metabolic mechanisms that govern T cell memory 
differentiation. Yet much less is known of how signaling pathways that are 
common circuitries of multiple environmental signals regulate T cell outcome 
and, precisely, T cell memory. The function of the NFκB signaling system is 
perhaps best understood in innate cells. Recent findings suggest that NFκB 
signaling plays an essential and unique role in generating and maintaining CD8 T 
cell memory. This review aims to summarize these findings and discuss the 
remaining questions in the field.","Copyright © 2023 Daniels, Luera and Teixeiro.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1129191

Treg homeostasis and function. Here we report that the transcription factor BATF 
maintains homeostasis and functionality of BM Tregs to facilitate homeostatic 
regulation of hematopoiesis and B cell development. Treg-specific ablation of 
BATF profoundly compromised proportions of BM Tregs associated with reduced 
expression of Treg effector molecules, including CD44, ICOS, KLRG1, and TIGIT. 
Moreover, BATF deficiency in Tregs led to increased numbers of hematopoietic 
stem cells (HSCs), multipotent progenitors (MPPs), and granulocyte-macrophage 
progenitors (GMPs), while reducing the functionality of myeloid progenitors and 
the generation of common lymphoid progenitors. Furthermore, Tregs lacking BATF 
failed to support the development of B cells in the BM. Mechanistically, BATF 
mediated IL-7 signaling to promote expression of effector molecules on BM Tregs 
and their homeostasis. Our studies reveal a previously unappreciated role for 
BATF in sustaining BM Treg homeostasis and function to ensure hematopoiesis.","Copyright © 2023 Tikka, Beasley, Xu, Yang, Cooper, Lechner, Gutch, Kaplan,

for human disorders. Given the importance of T cells in health and disease, 
comprehensive knowledge of canine T cells can contribute to our understanding of 
pathogenesis mechanisms and inform the development of new treatment strategies. 
However, the diversity of canine T cells is still poorly understood mainly due 
to the lack of species-reactive antibodies for use in flow cytometry. The aim of 
this study was to generate a detailed atlas of peripheral blood TCRαβ+ T cells 
of healthy dogs using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) combined with immune 
repertoire sequencing. A total of 22 TCRαβ+ T cell clusters were identified, 
which were classified into three major groups: CD4-dominant (11 clusters), 
CD8A-dominant (8 clusters), and CD4/CD8A-mixed (3 clusters). Based on 
differential gene expression, distinct differentiation states (naïve, effector, 
memory, exhausted) and lineages (e.g. CD4 T helper and regulatory T cells) could 
be distinguished. Importantly, several T cell populations were identified, which 
have not been described in dogs before. Of particular note, our data provide 
first evidence for the existence of canine mucosa-associated invariant T cell 
(MAIT)-like cells, representing one of three newly identified FCER1G+ 
innate-like CD8A+ T cell populations in the peripheral blood of healthy dogs. In 
conclusion, using scRNAseq combined with immune repertoire sequencing we were 
able to resolve canine TCRαβ+ T cell populations at unprecedented resolution. 
The peripheral blood TCRαβ+ T cell atlas of healthy dogs generated here 
represents an important reference data set for future studies and is of 
relevance for identifying new targets for T cell-specific therapies.","Copyright © 2023 Eschke, Moore, Chang, Alber and Keller.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1123366

Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.","BACKGROUND: Tuberculoma is the most common type of surgically removed benign 
solid solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) and can lead to a high risk of 
misdiagnoses for clinicians. This study aimed to discuss the value of the 
immunocyte count combined with computed tomography (CT) features in 
distinguishing pulmonary tuberculoma from malignancy among non-calcified solid 
SPNs.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients with pulmonary tuberculoma and 52 patients with 
lung cancer were retrospectively included in our study. Univariate and 
multivariate analyses were conducted to screen the independent predictors. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to investigate 
the validity of the predictive model.
RESULTS: The univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a coarse margin, 
vacuole, lobulation, pleural indentation, cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ 
T-lymphocyte count, and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count were independent predictors for 
distinguishing pulmonary tuberculoma from malignancy. The sensitivity, 
specificity, accuracy, and the area under the ROC curve of the model comprising 
the CD3+ T-lymphocyte count were 79.2%, 75%, 74.5%, and 0.845 [95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.759-0.910], respectively, and those of the model involving the 
CD4+ T-lymphocyte count were 77.1%, 78.8%, 77.1%, and 0.857 (95% CI, 
0.773-0.919), respectively.

and memory states results in large scale changes in transcriptional and 
phenotypic profiles. Little is known about how large-scale changes in genome 
organisation reflect or underpin these transcriptional programs. We utilised 
Hi-C to map changes in the spatial organisation of long-range genome contacts 
within naïve, effector and memory virus-specific CD8 + T cells. We observed that 
the architecture of the naive CD8 + T cell genome was distinct from effector and 
memory genome configurations with extensive changes within discrete functional 
chromatin domains. However, deletion of the BACH2 or SATB1 transcription factors 
was sufficient to remodel the naïve chromatin architecture and engage 
transcriptional programs characteristic of differentiated cells. This suggests 
that the chromatin architecture within naïve CD8 + T cells is preconfigured to 
undergo autonomous remodelling upon activation, with key transcription factors 
restraining differentiation by actively enforcing the unique naïve chromatin 
state.
ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: CD8 + T cell naïvety is actively maintained by 
transcription factors that enforce a distinct, naïve chromatin architecture.
HIGHLIGHTS: CD8 + T cell differentiation states are underscored by distinct 
chromatin looping architectures. Chromatin loops juxtapose CTL state appropriate 
enhancers, transcription factors and genes.Effector and memory CTLs have similar 
genome architectures, explaining rapid memory recall.CTL differentiation is 
restrained by BACH2 and SATB1, which enforce a naïve loop architecture.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.26.530139

cells and produce IgM-dominant antibodies as well as many progeny virions. The 
aims of the present study were to confirm the IgM dominance of 
thyrotropin-receptor antibodies (TRAbs) produced by EBV reactivation and 
investigate the roles of TRAb-IgM in Graves' disease. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) containing TRAb-producing cells were stimulated for 
EBV reactivation, and TRAb-IgM and TRAb-IgG were measured by ELISA. TRAb-IgM 
were purified and TSH-binding inhibitory activities were assessed using a 
radio-receptor assay. Porcine thyroid follicular epithelial cells were cultured 
with TRAb-IgM and/or complements to measure the intracellular levels of cAMP and 
the amount of LDH released. TRAb-IgM/TRAb-IgG (the MG ratio) was examined in 
sequential serum samples of Graves' disease and compared among groups of thyroid 
function. The results obtained showed that IgM-dominant TRAb production was 
induced by EBV reactivation. TRAb-IgM did not inhibit TSH binding to TSH 
receptors and did not transduce hormone-producing signals. However, it destroyed 
thyroid follicular epithelial cells with complements. The MG ratio was 
significantly higher in samples of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism than in 
those with normal function or in healthy controls. A close relationship was 
observed between TRAb-IgM produced by EBV reactivation and the development and 
exacerbation of Graves' disease. The present results provide novel insights for 
the development of prophylaxis and therapeutics for Graves' disease.","DOI: 10.1507/endocrj.EJ22-0609

laboratory biomarker in radioactive iodine-refractory (RAIR) locally advanced 
and/or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and determine its 
correlation with overall survival (OS).
METHODS: We retrospectively included 172 patients with locally advanced and/or 
metastatic RAIR DTC admitted between 1993 and 2021 at INCA. Age at diagnosis, 
histology, presence of distant metastasis (DM), DM site, neutrophil-to- 
lymphocyte ratio (NLR), imaging studies such as PET/CT results, progression free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data were analyzed. NLR was calculated 
at the time of locally advanced and/or metastatic disease diagnosis and the 
cutoff value was 3. Survival curves were established using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. The confidence interval is 95%, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant RESULTS: Out of 172 patients, 106 were 
locally advanced, and 150 presented DM at some point during follow-up. Regarding 
NLR data, 35 had NLR over 3 and 137 had NLR under 3. Higher NLR at was 
associated with shorter OS (6 vs. 10; p = 0.05) and with highest SUV on FDG 
PET-CT (15.9 vs. 7.7, p = 0.013). We found no association between higher NLR and 
age at diagnosis, DM or final status.
CONCLUSION: NLR higher than 3 at the time of locally advanced and/or metastatic 
disease diagnosis is an independent fator for shorter OS in RAIR DTC patients. 
Noteworthy higher NLR was also associated with highest SUV on FDG PET-CT in this 
population.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

the bone marrow (BM) and cultured in the presence of growth factors that support 
DC development, such as FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) and 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Guo et al., J Immunol 
Methods 432:24-29, 2016). In response to these growth factors, DC progenitors 
expand and differentiate, while other cell types die during the in vitro culture 
period, ultimately leading to relatively homogenous DC populations. An 
alternative method, which is discussed in detail in this chapter, relies on 
conditional immortalization of progenitor cells with DC potential in vitro using 
an estrogen-regulated form of Hoxb8 (ERHBD-Hoxb8). Such progenitors are 
established by retroviral transduction of largely unseparated BM cells with a 
retroviral vector expressing ERHBD-Hoxb8. Treatment of ERHBD-Hoxb8-expressing 
progenitors with estrogen results in Hoxb8 activation, which blocks cell 
differentiation and allows for expansion of homogenous progenitor cell 
populations in the presence of FLT3L. These cells, referred to as Hoxb8-FL 
cells, retain lineage potential for lymphocyte and myeloid lineages, including 
the DC lineage. Upon removal of estrogen (inactivation of Hoxb8), Hoxb8-FL cells 
differentiate into highly homogenous DC populations in the presence of GM-CSF or 
FLT3L akin to their endogenous counterparts. Given their unlimited proliferative 
capacity and amenability for genetic manipulation, for example, by CRISPR/Cas9, 
these cells provide a large number of options to investigate DC biology. Here, I 
am describing the method to establish Hoxb8-FL cells from mouse BM, as well as 
procedures for DC generation and gene deletion using lentivirally delivered

particles, both of which are hazardous to health. The inhalation of airborne PM 
with a diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) can cause considerable lung damage. Cornuside 
(CN), a natural bisiridoid glucoside derived from the fruit of Cornus 
officinalis Sieb, exerts protective properties against tissue damage via 
controlling the immunological response and reducing inflammation. However, 
information regarding the therapeutic potential of CN in patients with 
PM2.5-induced lung injury is limited. Thus, herein, we examined the protective 
properties of CN against PM2.5-induced lung damage. Mice were categorized into 
eight groups (n = 10): a mock control group, a CN control group (0.8 mg/kg mouse 
body weight), four PM2.5+CN groups (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg mouse body 
weight), and a PM2.5+CN group (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg mouse body weight). 
The mice were administered with CN 30 min following intratracheal tail vein 
injection of PM2.5. In mice exposed to PM2.5, different parameters including 
changes in lung tissue wet/dry (W/D) lung weight ratio, total protein/total cell 
ratio, lymphocyte counts, inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluid (BALF), vascular permeability, and histology were examined. Our 
findings revealed that CN reduced lung damage, the W/D weight ratio, and 
hyperpermeability caused by PM2.5. Moreover, CN reduced the plasma levels of 
inflammatory cytokines produced because of PM2.5 exposure, such as tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and nitric oxide, as well as the 
total protein concentration in the BALF, and successfully attenuated 
PM2.5-associated lymphocytosis. In addition, CN substantially reduced the 
expression levels of Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4), MyD88, and autophagy-related 
proteins LC3 II and Beclin 1, and increased protein phosphorylation of the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Thus, the anti-inflammatory property of CN 
renders it a potential therapeutic agent for treating PM2.5-induced lung injury 
by controlling the TLR4-MyD88 and mTOR-autophagy pathways.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24054979

humans' health. The gastrointestinal microbiota and its metabolites can modulate 
the host's physiology and immune system. Recent research demonstrated the role 
of commensal bacteria and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in developing 
resistance to Salmonella infection and colonization. However, the complex 
interactions among chicken, Salmonella, host-microbiome, and microbial 
metabolites remain unelucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to explore these 
complex interactions by identifying the driver and hub genes highly correlated 
with factors that confer resistance to Salmonella. Differential gene expression 
(DEGs) and dynamic developmental genes (DDGs) analyses and weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed using transcriptome data 
from the cecum of Salmonella Enteritidis-infected chicken at 7 and 21 days after 
infection. Furthermore, we identified the driver and hub genes associated with 
important traits such as the heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, body weight 
post-infection, bacterial load, propionate and valerate cecal contents, and 
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria cecal relative abundance. Among 
the multiple genes detected in this study, EXFABP, S100A9/12, CEMIP, FKBP5, 
MAVS, FAM168B, HESX1, EMC6, and others were found as potential candidate gene

recognition of peptide antigens through the T Cell Receptor (TCR). After TCR 
engagement, a signaling cascade is activated, leading to T cell activation, 
proliferation, and differentiation into effector cells. Delicate control of 
activation signals coupled to the TCR is needed to avoid uncontrolled immune 
responses involving T cells. It has been previously shown that mice deficient in 
the expression of the adaptor NTAL (Non-T cell activation linker), a molecule 
structurally and evolutionarily related to the transmembrane adaptor LAT (Linker 
for the Activation of T cells), develop an autoimmune syndrome characterized by 
the presence of autoantibodies and enlarged spleens. In the present work we 
intended to deepen investigation into the negative regulatory functions of the 
NTAL adaptor in T cells and its potential relationship with autoimmune 
disorders. For this purpose, in this work we used Jurkat cells as a T cell 
model, and we lentivirally transfected them to express the NTAL adaptor in order 
to analyze the effect on intracellular signals associated with the TCR. In 
addition, we analyzed the expression of NTAL in primary CD4+ T cells from 
healthy donors and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. Our results showed that 
NTAL expression in Jurkat cells decreased calcium fluxes and PLC-γ1 activation 
upon stimulation through the TCR complex. Moreover, we showed that NTAL was also 
expressed in activated human CD4+ T cells, and that the increase of its 
expression was reduced in CD4+ T cells from RA patients. Our results, together 
with previous reports, suggest a relevant role for the NTAL adaptor as a 
negative regulator of early intracellular TCR signaling, with a potential 
implication in RA.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24054574

(EAE) in C57BL/6 mice occurs due to changes in the profile of bone marrow stem 
cells differentiation. This leads to the appearance of lymphocytes producing 
antibodies-abzymes that hydrolyze DNA, myelin basic protein (MBP), and histones. 
The activity of abzymes in the hydrolysis of these auto-antigens slowly but 
constantly increases during the spontaneous development of EAE. Treatment of 
mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) leads to a sharp increase in 
the activity of these abzymes with their maximum at 20 days (acute phase) after 
immunization. In this work, we analyzed changes in the activity of IgG-abzymes 
hydrolyzing (pA)23, (pC)23, (pU)23, and six miRNAs (miR-9-5p, miR-219a-5p, 
miR-326, miR-155-5p, miR-21-3p, and miR-146a-3p) before and after mice 
immunization with MOG. Unlike abzymes hydrolyzing DNA, MBP, and histones, the 
spontaneous development of EAE leads not to an increase but to a permanent 
decrease of IgGs activity of hydrolysis of RNA-substrates. Treatment of mice 
with MOG resulted in a sharp but transient increase in the activity of 
antibodies by day 7 (onset of the disease), followed by a sharp decrease in 
activity 20-40 days after immunization. A significant difference in the 
production of abzymes against DNA, MBP, and histones before and after mice 
immunization with MOG with those against RNAs may be since the expression of 
many miRNAs decreased with age. This can lead to a decrease in the production of 
antibodies and abzymes that hydrolyze miRNAs with age mice.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24054433

by recognizing antigens from pathogens or tumors. In pathological situations, 
failure to generate de novo T cells causes immunodeficiency resulting in acute 
infections and complications. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transplantation 
constitutes a valuable option to restore proper immune function. However, 
delayed T cell reconstitution is observed compared to other lineages. To 
overcome this difficulty, we developed a new approach to identify populations 
with efficient lymphoid reconstitution properties. To this end, we use a DNA 
barcoding strategy based on the insertion into a cell chromosome of a lentivirus 
(LV) carrying a non-coding DNA fragment named barcode (BC). These will segregate 
through cell divisions and be present in cells' progeny. The remarkable 
characteristic of the method is that different cell types can be tracked 
simultaneously in the same mouse. Thus, we in vivo barcoded LMPP and CLP 
progenitors to test their ability to reconstitute the lymphoid lineage. Barcoded 
progenitors were co-grafted in immuno-compromised mice and their fate analyzed

population worldwide. T-cell derived factors such as Th17 and Th1 cytokines or 
cytokines such as IL-23, which favors Th17-expansion/differentiation, dominate 
in the disease. Therapies targeting these factors have been developed over the 
years. An autoimmune component is present, as autoreactive T-cells specific for 
keratins, the antimicrobial peptide LL37 and ADAMTSL5 have been described. Both 
autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T-cells exist, produce pathogenic cytokines, and 
correlate with disease activity. Along with the assumption that psoriasis is a 
T-cell-driven disease, Tregs have been studied extensively over the years, both 
in the skin and in circulation. This narrative review resumes the main findings 
about Tregs in psoriasis. We discuss how Tregs increase in psoriasis but are 
impaired in their regulatory/suppressive function. We debate the possibility 
that Tregs convert into T-effector cells under inflammatory conditions; for 
instance, they may turn into Th17-cells. We put particular emphasis on therapies 
that seem to counteract this conversion. We have enriched this review with an 
experimental section analyzing T-cells specific for the autoantigen LL37 in a 
healthy subject, suggesting that a shared specificity may exist between Tregs 
and autoreactive responder T-cells. This suggests that successful psoriasis 
treatments may, among other effects, restore Tregs numbers and functions.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24054348

Current evidence suggests a pathogenic role of γδT cells, but the growing 
complexity of this population has made the offending subset difficult to 
pinpoint. The work on γδTCRint and γδTCRhi subsets, which express intermediate 
and high levels of γδTCR at their surface, respectively, is particularly scarce, 
leaving their inner workings in PV essentially unresolved. We have shown here 
that the γδTCRint/γδTCRhi cell composition and their transcriptom are related to 
the differential miRNA expression by performing a targeted miRNA and mRNA 
quantification (RT-qPCR) in multiplexed, flow-sorted γδ blood T cells from 
healthy controls (n = 14) and patients with PV (n = 13). A significant loss of 
miR-20a in bulk γδT cells (~fourfold decrease, PV vs. controls) largely mirrored 
increasing Vδ1-Vδ2- and γδintVδ1-Vδ2- cell densities in the bloodstream, 
culminating in a relative excess of γδintVδ1-Vδ2- cells for PV. Transcripts 
encoding DNA-binding factors (ZBTB16), cytokine receptors (IL18R1), and cell 
adhesion molecules (SELPLG) were depleted in the process, closely tracking 
miR-20a availability in bulk γδ T-cell RNA. Compared to controls, PV was also 
associated with enhanced miR-92b expression (~13-fold) in bulk γδT cells that 
lacked association with the γδT cell composition. The miR-29a and let-7c 
expressions remained unaltered in case-control comparisons. Overall, our data 
expand the current landscape of the peripheral γδT cell composition, underlining 
changes in its mRNA/miRNA transcriptional circuits that may inform PV

mechanism underlying how the transcription factors (TFs) Twist1 and Zeb1 
influence the prognosis of mycosis fungoides (MF). We used laser-captured 
microdissection to dissect malignant T-cells obtained from 40 skin biopsies from 
40 MF patients with stage I-IV disease. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to 
determinate the protein expression levels of Twist1 and Zeb1. Based on RNA 
sequencing, principal component analysis (PCA), differential expression (DE) 
analysis, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), and hub gene analysis were performed 
between the high and low Twist1 IHC expression cases. The DNA from 28 samples 
was used to analyze the TWIST1 promoter methylation level. In the PCA, Twist1 
IHC expression seemed to classify cases into different groups. The DE analysis 
yielded 321 significant genes. In the IPA, 228 significant upstream regulators 
and 177 significant master regulators/causal networks were identified. In the 
hub gene analysis, 28 hub genes were found. The methylation level of TWIST1 
promoter regions did not correlate with Twist1 protein expression. Zeb1 protein 
expression did not show any major correlation with global RNA expression in the 
PCA. Many of the observed genes and pathways associated with high Twist1 
expression are known to be involved in immunoregulation, lymphocyte 
differentiation, and aggressive tumor biology. In conclusion, Twist1 might be an 
important regulator in the disease progression of MF.","DOI: 10.3390/cancers15051527

recurrence and progression in localized disease. A better understanding of the 
role of the tumor microenvironment in carcinogenesis and response to treatment 
is needed.
METHODS: Peripheral blood and samples of urothelial bladder cancer and adjacent 
healthy urothelial tissue were collected from 41 patients and stratified in low- 
and high-grade urothelial bladder cancer, excluding muscular infiltration or 
carcinoma in situ. Mononuclear cells were isolated and labeled for flow 
cytometry analysis with antibodies aimed at identifying specific subpopulations 
within T lymphocytes, myeloid cells and NK cells.
RESULTS: In peripheral blood and tumor samples, we detected different 
percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, monocyte and myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells, as well as differential expression of activation- and 
exhaustion-related markers. Conversely, only a significant increase in bladder 
total monocytes was found when comparing bladder and tumor samples. 
Interestingly, we identified specific markers differentially expressed in the 
peripheral blood of patients with different outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The analysis of host immune response in patients with NMIBC may help 
to identify specific markers that allow optimizing therapy and patient 
follow-up. Further investigation is needed to establish a strong predictive

with other fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILD), and as a result it can be 
misdiagnosed as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We aimed to determine the 
value of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) total cell count (TCC) and lymphocytosis 
in distinguishing fHP and IPF and to evaluate the best cut-off points 
discriminating these two fibrotic ILD.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of fHP and IPF patients diagnosed between 
2005 and 2018 was conducted. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the 
diagnostic utility of clinical parameters in differentiating between fHP and 
IPF. Based on the ROC analysis, BAL parameters were evaluated for their 
diagnostic performance, and optimal diagnostic cut-offs were established.
RESULTS: A total of 136 patients (65 fHP and 71 IPF) were included (mean age 
54.97 ± 10.87 vs. 64.00 ± 7.18 years, respectively). BAL TCC and the percentage 
of lymphocytes were significantly higher in fHP compared to IPF (p < 0.001). BAL 
lymphocytosis >30% was found in 60% of fHP patients and none of the patients 
with IPF. The logistic regression revealed that younger age, never smoker 
status, identified exposure, lower FEV1, higher BAL TCC and higher BAL 
lymphocytosis increased the probability of fibrotic HP diagnosis. The 
lymphocytosis >20% increased by 25 times the odds of fibrotic HP diagnosis. The 
optimal cut-off values to differentiate fibrotic HP from IPF were 15 × 106 for 
TCC and 21% for BAL lymphocytosis with AUC 0.69 and 0.84, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased cellularity and lymphocytosis in BAL persist despite lung 
fibrosis in HP patients and may be used as important discriminators between IPF 
and fHP.","DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics13050935

inhabits the gastrointestinal tract. This commensal microbiota can contribute to 
the regulation of host immune response and homeostasis. Alterations of the gut 
microbiota have been found in many immune-related diseases. The metabolites 
generated by specific microorganisms in the gut microbiota, such as short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan (Trp) and bile acid (BA) metabolites, not only 
affect genetic and epigenetic regulation but also impact metabolism in the 
immune cells, including immunosuppressive and inflammatory cells. The 
immunosuppressive cells (such as tolerogenic macrophages (tMacs), tolerogenic 
dendritic cells (tDCs), myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), regulatory T 
cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Breg) and innate lymphocytes (ILCs)) and 
inflammatory cells (such as inflammatory Macs (iMacs), DCs, CD4 T helper (Th)1, 
CD4Th2, Th17, natural killer (NK) T cells, NK cells and neutrophils) can express 
different receptors for SCFAs, Trp and BA metabolites from different 
microorganisms. Activation of these receptors not only promotes the 
differentiation and function of immunosuppressive cells but also inhibits 
inflammatory cells, causing the reprogramming of the local and systemic immune 
system to maintain the homeostasis of the individuals. We here will summarize 
the recent advances in understanding the metabolism of SCFAs, Trp and BA in the 
gut microbiota and the effects of SCFAs, Trp and BA metabolites on gut and

specific morphological changes in human primary T-cells exposed to various 
bacterial species and strains. Cells were challenged with sterile bacterial 
determinants, i.e., membrane vesicles or culture supernatants, derived from 
different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Timelapse QPI by digital 
holographic microscopy (DHM) was applied to capture changes in T-cell morphology 
over time. After numerical reconstruction and image segmentation, we calculated 
single cell area, circularity and mean phase contrast. Upon bacterial challenge, 
T-cells underwent rapid morphological changes such as cell shrinkage, 
alterations of mean phase contrast and loss of cell integrity. Time course and 
intensity of this response varied between both different species and strains. 
The strongest effect was observed for treatment with S. aureus-derived culture 
supernatants that led to complete lysis of the cells. Furthermore, cell 
shrinkage and loss of circular shape was stronger in Gram-negative than in 
Gram-positive bacteria. Additionally, T-cell response to bacterial virulence 
factors was concentration-dependent, as decreases in cellular area and 
circularity were enhanced with increasing concentrations of bacterial 
determinants. Our findings clearly indicate that T-cell response to bacterial 
stress depends on the causative pathogen, and specific morphological alterations 
can be detected using DHM.","DOI: 10.3390/cells12050762

because of the lack of sensitive liquid biopsy methods and effective biomarkers. 
We attempted to evaluate whether circulating inflammatory marker could 
complement CA199 for the detection of early-stage PC.
METHODS: We enrolled 430 patients with early-stage PC, 287 patients with other 
pancreatic tumors (OPT), and 401 healthy controls (HC). The patients and HC were 
randomly divided into a training set (n = 872) and two testing sets (n1 = 218, 
n2 = 28). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were investigated 
to evaluate the diagnostic performance of circulating inflammatory markers 
ratios, CA199, and combinations of the markers ratios in the training set, which 
would then be validated in the two testing sets.
RESULTS: Circulating fibrinogen, neutrophils, and monocytes in patients with PC 
were significantly higher while circulating albumin, prealbumin, lymphocytes, 
and platelets of patients with PC were significantly lower compared to those of 
HC and OPT (all P < 0.05). The fibrinogen-to-albumin (FAR), 
fibrinogen-to-prealbumin (FPR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte (MLR), and 
fibrinogen-to-lymphocyte (FLR) ratios were significantly higher while the 
prognostic nutrition index values (PNI) were lower in patients with PC than in 
HC and OPT (all P < 0.05). Combining the FAR, FPR, and FLR with CA199 exhibited 
the best diagnostic value for distinguishing patients with early-stage PC from 
HC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.964, and for distinguishing patients 
with early-stage PC from OPT with an AUC of 0.924 in the training sets. In the 
testing set, compared with HC, the combination markers had powerful efficiency 
for PC with an AUC 0.947 and AUC 0.942 when comparing PC with OPT. The AUC was 
0.915 for the combination of CA199, FAR, FPR, and FLR for differentiating 
between patients with pancreatic head cancer (PHC) and other pancreatic head 
tumors (OPHT), and 0.894 for differentiating between patients with pancreatic

the risk of infection and efficacy of revaccination. Many studies have described 
the reconstitution after stem cell transplantation (SCT). The recovery after 
cancer treatment in children who have not undergone SCT has mainly been 
investigated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), less for solid tumors. Here, 
we have examined the temporal evolution of total leukocyte, neutrophil and 
lymphocyte counts as surrogate parameters for the post-therapeutic immune 
recovery in a cohort of n = 52 patients with ALL in comparison to n = 58 
patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and n = 22 patients with Ewing sarcoma 
(ES). Patients with ALL showed an efficient increase in blood counts reaching 
the age-adjusted lower limits of normal between 4 and 5 months after the end of 
maintenance therapy. The two groups of patients with HD and ES exhibited a 
comparably delayed recovery of total leukocytes due to a protracted 
post-therapeutic lymphopenia which was most pronounced in patients with HD after 
irradiation. Overall, we observed a clearly more efficient resurgence of total 
lymphocyte counts in patients aged below 12 years compared to patients aged 12 
to 18 years. Our results underline that the kinetics of cellular reconstitution 
after therapy for HD and ES differ significantly from ALL and depend on 
treatment regimens and modalities as well as on patient age. This suggests a 
need for disease, treatment, and age specific recommendations concerning the 
duration of infection prophylaxis and the timing of revaccination.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-31217-3

if arterial thrombosis per se was associated with alterations in complete blood 
count (CBC) and white blood cell (WBC) differential count in mice. 
Twelve-week-old C57Bl/6 mice were used for FeCl3-mediated carotid thrombosis 
(n = 72), sham-operation (n = 79), or non-operation (n = 26). Monocyte count 
(/µL) at 30-min after thrombosis (median 160 [interquartile range 140-280]) 
was ~ 1.3-fold higher than at 30-min after sham-operation (120 [77.5-170]), and 
twofold higher than in non-operated mice (80 [47.5-92.5]). At day-1 and -4 
post-thrombosis, compared with 30-min, monocyte count decreased by about 6% and 
28% to 150 [100-200] and 115 [100-127.5], which however were about 2.1-fold and 
1.9-fold higher than in sham-operated mice (70 [50-100] and 60 [30-75], 
respectively). Lymphocyte counts (/µL) at 1- and 4-days after thrombosis 
(mean ± SD; 3513 ± 912 and 2590 ± 860) were ~ 38% and ~ 54% lower than those in 
the sham-operated mice (5630 ± 1602 and 5596 ± 1437, respectively), and ~ 39% 
and ~ 55% lower than those in non-operated mice (5791 ± 1344). Post-thrombosis 
monocyte-lymphocyte-ratio (MLR) was substantially higher at all three 
time-points (0.050 ± 0.02, 0.046 ± 0.025, and 0.050 ± 0.02) vs. sham 
(0.003 ± 0.021, 0.013 ± 0.004, and 0.010 ± 0.004). MLR was 0.013 ± 0.005 in 
non-operated mice. This is the first report on acute arterial thrombosis-related

persistent HIV reservoirs that are established during the very early stages of 
infection. The tissue-specific factors that direct T cells to establish tissue 
residency are not well defined, nor are the factors that establish viral 
latency. We report that costimulation via MAdCAM-1 and retinoic acid (RA), two 
constituents of gut tissues, together with TGF-β, promote the differentiation of 
CD4+ T cells into a distinct subset α4β7+CD69+CD103+ TRM-like cells. Among the 
costimulatory ligands we evaluated, MAdCAM-1 was unique in its capacity to 
upregulate both CCR5 and CCR9. MAdCAM-1 costimulation rendered cells susceptible 
to HIV infection. Differentiation of TRM-like cells was reduced by MAdCAM-1 
antagonists developed to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. These finding 
provide a framework to better understand the contribution of CD4+ TRMs to 
persistent viral reservoirs and HIV pathogenesis.","Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be

(COVID-19)-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in children with 
acute appendicitis (AA) can cause diagnostic dilemmas. This study aimed to 
evaluate the efficacy of a previously described scoring system and improve its 
diagnostic ability in differentiating between these diseases.
METHODS: This study was conducted between March 2020 and January 2022. Patients 
who had MIS-C with gastrointestinal system (GIS) involvement and patients who 
underwent surgery for appendicitis were included. First, all patients were 
evaluated using the new scoring system (NSS). The groups were compared by adding 
new MISC-specific parameters to NSS. The scoring system was evaluated using 
propensity score matching (PSM).
RESULTS: A total of 35 patients with abdominal pain due to GIS involvement in 
MIS-C (group A) and 37 patients with AA who had ALT, PRC, and D-dimer results at 
their first admission (group B) were included in the study. The mean age of 
patients in group A was lower than that of patients in group B (p < 0.001). 
False NSS positivity was found in 45.7% of the patients with MIS-C. Lymphocyte 
(p = 0.021) and platelet counts (p = 0.036) were significantly lower in the 
blood count and serum D-dimer (p = 0.034), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), 
and procalcitonin (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the MIS-C group. We 
created a scoring system called the Appendicitis-MISC Score (AMS) using the NSS 
and new parameters. The sensitivity and specificity of AMS diagnostic scores 
were 91.9% and 80%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: MIS-C with GIS involvement may present as acute abdomen. It is 
difficult to differentiate this condition from acute appendicitis. AMS has been 
shown to be useful for this differentiation.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

activity of immune checkpoints bring innovation to the field of immuno-oncology, 
they are still limited in their efficiency to infiltrate the tumor 
microenvironment due to their large molecular size (150 kDa) and the necessity 
of additional engineering works to ablate effector functions for antibodies 
targeting immune cells. To address these issues, the human PD-1 (hPD-1) 
ectodomain, a small protein moiety of 14-17 kDa, has been considered as a 
therapeutic agent. Here, we used bacterial display-based high-throughput 
directed evolution to successfully isolate glycan-controlled (aglycosylated or 
only single-N-linked glycosylated) human PD-1 variants exhibiting over 1000-fold 
increased hPD-L1 binding affinity compared to that of wild-type hPD-1. The 
resulting hPD-1 variants, aglycosylated JYQ12 and JYQ12-2 with a single-N-linked 
glycan chain, showed exceptionally high binding affinity to hPD-L1 and very high 
affinity to both hPD-L2 and mPD-L1. Moreover, the JYQ12-2 efficiently 
potentiated the proliferation of human T cells. hPD-1 variants with 
significantly improved binding affinities for hPD-1 ligands could be used as 
effective therapeutics or diagnostics that can be differentiated from 
large-sized IgG antibody-based molecules.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.3c00003

(PD‑1) is elevated, and it interacts with PD ligand 1 (PD‑L1), rendering 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‑T cells dysfunctional. Hence, CAR‑T cells immune 
to PD‑1‑induced immunosuppression were constructed to improve the function of 
CAR‑T cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Double‑target CAR‑T cells, 
targeting glypican‑3 (GPC3) [a tumour-associated antigen (TAA)] and hindering 
PD‑1‑PD‑L1 binding, were established. The expression of GPC3, PD‑L1, and 
inhibitory receptors was measured using flow cytometry. The cytotoxicity, 
cytokine release, and differentiation level of CAR‑T cells were determined using 
lactate dehydrogenase release assay, enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay, and flow 
cytometry, respectively. HCC cells were targeted and eliminated by double‑target 
CAR‑T cells. These double‑target CAR‑T cells limit PD‑1‑PD‑L1 binding and 
sustain cytotoxicity to PD‑L1+ HCC cells. The relatively low IR expression and 
differentiation level in double‑target CAR‑T cells in tumour tissues induced 
tumour‑suppression and extended survival in PD‑L1+ HCC TX models, as opposed to 
their single‑target counterparts. The results of the present study suggested 
that the newly constructed double‑target CAR‑T cells exhibit stronger 
tumour‑suppressing effects in HCC than their single‑target counterparts, which 
are common, suggesting the potential of strengthening CAR‑T cell activity in HCC 
treatment.","DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2023.5501

leukocyte-vascular interactions, but their functions in extravascular cell-cell 
communications is still debated. The roles of these two ligands in leukocyte 
trafficking, lymphocyte differentiation, and immunity to influenza infections 
were dissected in the present study. Surprisingly, double ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 
knock out mice (herein ICAM-1/2-/- mice) infected with a lab adapted H1N1 
influenza A virus fully recovered from infection, elicited potent humoral 
immunity, and generated normal long lasting anti-viral CD8+ T cell memory. 
Furthermore, lung capillary ICAMs were dispensable for both NK and neutrophil 
entry to virus infected lungs. Mediastinal lymph nodes (MedLNs) of ICAM-1/2-/- 
mice poorly recruited naïve T cells and B lymphocytes but elicited normal 
humoral immunity critical for viral clearance and effective CD8+ differentiation 
into IFN-γ producing T cells. Furthermore, whereas reduced numbers of virus 
specific effector CD8+ T cells accumulated inside infected ICAM-1/2-/- lungs, 
normal virus-specific TRM CD8+ cells were generated inside these lungs and fully 
protected ICAM-1/2-/- mice from secondary heterosubtypic infections. B 
lymphocyte entry to the MedLNs and differentiation into extrafollicular 
plasmablasts, producing high affinity anti-influenza IgG2a antibodies, were also 
ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 independent. A potent antiviral humoral response was 
associated with accumulation of hyper-stimulated cDC2s in ICAM null MedLNs and 
higher numbers of virus-specific T follicular helper (Tfh) cells generated 
following lung infection. Mice selectively depleted of cDC ICAM-1 expression 
supported, however, normal CTL and Tfh differentiation following influenza 
infection, ruling out essential co-stimulatory functions of DC ICAM-1 in CD8+ 
and CD4+ T cell differentiation. Collectively our findings suggest that lung 
ICAMs are dispensable for innate leukocyte trafficking to influenza infected 
lungs, for the generation of peri-epithelial TRM CD8+ cells, and long term 
anti-viral cellular immunity. In lung draining LNs, although ICAMs promote 
lymphocyte homing, these key integrin ligands are not required for 
influenza-specific humoral immunity or generation of IFN-γ effector CD8+ T 
cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest unexpected compensatory mechanisms 
that orchestrate protective anti-influenza immunity in the absence of vascular 
and extravascular ICAMs.","Copyright © 2023 Kozlovski, Regev, Sapoznikov, Kizner, Achdout,

longitudinal cohort, nivolumab treatment removes neoantigens exclusively in the 
immunopeptidome of nonimmune-edited patients, the group with the best overall

psychological problems, especially long-term disability. The purpose of this 
article is to explore molecular mechanisms linking TBI and pyroptosis with the 
aim of providing a promising target for future therapeutic interventions.
METHODS: GSE104687 microarray dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus database to obtain differential expressed genes. Meanwhile, 
pyroptosis-related genes were screened from GeneCards database, and the 
overlapped genes were considered as the pyroptosis-related genes in TBI. The 
immune infiltration analysis was conducted to quantify lymphocyte infiltration 
levels. Moreover, we researched the relevant microRNAs (miRNAs) and 
transcription factors and investigated the interactions and functions of miRNAs. 
In addition, the validation set and in vivo experiment further verified the 
expression of hub gene.
RESULTS: Altogether, we found 240 differential expressed genes in GSE104687 and 
254 pyroptosis-related genes in the GeneCards database, and the overlapped gene 
was caspase 8 (CASP8). Immune Infiltration Analysis suggested the abundance of 
Tregs cells was significantly higher in TBI group. The NKT and CD8+ Tem were 
positively correlated with the expression levels of CASP8. The most significant 
term regarding CASP8 in Reactome pathways analysis was related to NF-kappaB. A 
total of 20 miRNAs and 25 transcription factors associated with CASP8 were 
obtained. After investigating the interactions and functions of miRNAs, the 
NF-kappaB-related signaling pathway was still enriched with a relatively low 
P-value. The validation set and in vivo experiment further verified the 
expression of CASP8.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the potential role of CASP8 in pathogenesis of 
TBI, which may provide a new target for individualized therapy and drug 
development.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.wneu.2023.03.004

disease affecting multiple organs and tissues with high cellular heterogeneity. 
CD8+ T cell activity is involved in the SLE pathogenesis. However, the cellular 
heterogeneity and the underlying mechanisms of CD8+ T cells in SLE remain to be 
identified.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of PBMCs from a SLE family 
pedigree (including 3 HCs and 2 SLE patients) was performed to identify the 
SLE-associated CD8+ T cell subsets. Flow cytometry analysis of a SLE cohort 
(including 23 HCs and 33 SLE patients), qPCR analysis of another SLE cohort 
(including 30 HCs and 25 SLE patients) and public scRNA-seq datasets of 
autoimmune diseases were employed to validate the finding. Whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) of this SLE family pedigree was used to investigate the genetic 
basis in dysregulation of CD8+ T cell subsets identified in this study. 
Co-culture experiments were performed to analyze the activity of CD8+ T cells.
FINDINGS: We elucidated the cellular heterogeneity of SLE and identified a new 
highly cytotoxic CD8+ T cell subset, CD161-CD8+ TEMRA cell subpopulation, which 
was remarkably increased in SLE patients. Meanwhile, we discovered a close 
correlation between mutation of DTHD1 and the abnormal accumulation of 
CD161-CD8+ TEMRA cells in SLE. DTHD1 interacted with MYD88 to suppress its 
activity in T cells and DTHD1 mutation promoted MYD88-dependent pathway and 
subsequently increased the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD161-CD8+ TEMRA 
cells. Furthermore, the differentially expressed genes in CD161-CD8+ TEMRA cells 
displayed a strong out-of-sample prediction for case-control status of SLE.
INTERPRETATION: This study identified DTHD1-associated expansion of CD161-CD8+ 
TEMRA cell subpopulation is critical for SLE. Our study highlights genetic 
association and cellular heterogeneity of SLE pathogenesis and provides a 
mechanistical insight into the diagnosis and treatment of SLE.

metastasis. High grade worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) is associated with an 
increased risk of nodal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, it still remains 
unanswered whether to perform an elective neck dissection for clinically 
node-negative disease or not. This study aims to evaluate the role of 
histological parameters including WPOI in predicting nodal metastasis in 
early-stage oral cancers. This analytical observational study comprised 100 
patients of early-stage, node-negative, oral squamous cell carcinoma, admitted 
in the Surgical Oncology Department from April, 2018 till the sample size was 
reached. The socio-demographic data, clinical history, and findings of clinical 
and radiological examination were noted. The association of nodal metastasis 
with various histological parameters like tumour size, degree of 
differentiation, depth of invasion (DOI), WPOI, perineural invasion (PNI), 
lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and lymphocytic response was determined. SPSS 20.0 
statistical tool; student's 't' test and chi-square tests were applied. While 
the buccal mucosa was the commonest site, the rate of occult metastasis was 
highest in the tongue. Nodal metastasis was not significantly associated with 
age, sex, smoking and primary site. While the nodal positivity was not 
significantly associated with tumour size, pathological stage, DOI, PNI and 
lymphocytic response, it was associated with LVI, degree of differentiation and 
WPOI. Increasing WPOI grade correlated significantly with the nodal stage, LVI 
and PNI, but not with DOI. WPOI is not only a significant predictor of occult 
nodal metastasis but can also be a novel therapeutic tool in the management of 
early-stage oral cancers. In patients with an aggressive WPOI pattern or other 
high-risk histological parameters, the neck can be addressed with either 
elective neck dissection or radiotherapy after wide excision of the primary 
tumor; otherwise, an active surveillance approach can be followed.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Association of Surgical

lymphoma (DLBCL) are reportedly different when compared with the healthy 
population and it remains unclear if the gut microbiota affects host immunity 
and clinical disease features. This research investigated the gut microbiota in 
patients with untreated DLBCL and analyzed its correlation with patient clinical 
characteristics, humoral, and cell immune status.
METHODS: Thirty-five patients with untreated DLBCL and 20 healthy controls (HCs) 
were recruited to this study and microbiota differences in stool samples were 
analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Absolute ratios of immune cell subset counts in 
peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry and peripheral blood cytokine 
levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relationships between 
changes in patient microbiomes and clinical characteristics, such as clinical 
stage, international prognostic index (IPI) risk stratification, cell origin, 
organ involved and treatment responses were investigated and correlations 
between differential microbiota and host immune indices were analyzed.
RESULTS: The alpha-diversity index of intestinal microecology in DLBCL patients 
was not significantly different when compared with HCs (P>0.05), nonetheless 
beta-diversity was significantly decreased (P=0.001). p_Proteobacteria were 
dominant in DLBCL, while p_Bacteroidetes abundance was significantly decreased 
when compared with HCs (P<0.05). Gut microbiota characteristics were identified 
that were associated with clinical features, such as tumor load, risk 
stratification and cell origin, and correlation analyses were performed between 
differential flora abundance associated with these clinical features and host 
immune status. The p_Firmicutes was positively correlated with absolute 
lymphocyte values, g_Prevotella_2 and s_un_g_Prevotella_2 were negatively 
correlated with absolute lymphocyte values, T cell counts and CD4 cell counts, 
while g_Pyramidobacter, s_un_g_Pyramidobacter, and f_Peptostreptococcaceae were 
negatively correlated with IgA.
CONCLUSIONS: Dominant gut microbiota, abundance, diversity, and structure in 
DLBCL were influenced by the disease, correlated with patient immune status and 
this suggested that the microecology-immune axis may be involved in regulating 
lymphoma development. In the future, it may be possible to improve immune 
function in patients with DLBCL by regulating the gut microbiota, improve 
treatment response rates and increase patient survival rates.","Copyright © 2023 Lin, Mao, Jin, Wang, Lai, Zhang, Zhou, Ge, Zhang, Sun, Xu,

specificity regarding flow cytometry analysis of Ki67 expression during lymphoma 
diagnoses.
OBJECTIVE: This evaluated the efficacy of multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) in an 
estimate of the proliferative activity of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma by 
comparing the expression of Ki67 using MFC and immunohistochemicals (IHC).
METHOD: A total of 559 patients with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma were 
immunophenotyped using sensitive MFC, of which 517 were newly diagnosed and 42 
were transformed lymphomas. Test samples include peripheral blood, bone marrow, 
various body fluids, and tissues. Through MFC multi-marker accurate gating, 
abnormal mature B lymphocytes with restricted expression of the light chain were 
screened. Ki67 was added to determine the proliferation index; the positive rate 
of Ki67 in tumor B cells was evaluated by cell grouping and internal control. 
For tissue specimens, MFC and IHC analyses were performed simultaneously to 
assess the Ki67 proliferation index.
RESULTS: The positive rate of Ki67 by MFC was correlated with the subtype and 
aggressiveness of B-cell lymphoma. Ki67 could distinguish indolent lymphomas 
from aggressive subtypes with a cut-off value of 21.25%, and differentiate 
transformation from indolent lymphoma with a cut-off value of 7.65%. The 
expression of Ki67 by MFC (regardless of the type of samples)was highly 
agreement with the Ki67 proliferative index of tissue samples assessed by 
pathologic immunohistochemistry. MFC showed a fairly constant negative bias in 
evaluating tissue or bone marrow samples, compared with IHC.
CONCLUSIONS: Ki67 is a valuable flow marker that can distinguish between 
indolent and aggressive types of lymphoma and assess whether indolent lymphomas 
are transformed. Using MFC to evaluate the positive rate of Ki67 is important in 
clinical settings. MFC has unique advantages in judging the aggressiveness of 
lymphoma in samples of bone marrow, peripheral blood, pleural and ascites, and 
cerebrospinal fluid. This is particularly important when tissue samples cannot 
be obtained, making it an important supplement for pathologic examination.","Copyright © 2023 Mao, Li, Liu, He, Yi, Kuang, Xiao, Zhu and Wang.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2023.1108837

were assayed for all participants. The diagnosis of DDE corresponded with the 
codes enumerated in the World Dental Federation's modified DDE Index. Analyses 
relied on comparative statistics to determine risk factors associated with DDE. 
A total of 103 participants distributed among the three groups presented with at 
least one form of DDE, which indicated a prevalence of 18.59%. The HI group had 
the highest frequency of DDE-affected teeth (4.36%), while that of the HEU and 
HUU groups were 2.73% and 2.05%, respectively. Overall, the most encountered DDE 
was code 1 (Demarcated Opacity), accounting for 30.93% of all codes. DDE codes 
1, 4 and 6 showed significant associations with the HI and HEU groups in both 
dentitions (p < 0.05). We found no significant association DDE and either very 
low birth weight or preterm births. A marginal association with CD4+ lymphocyte 
count was observed in HI participants. DDE is prevalent in school-aged children, 
and HIV infection is a significant risk factor for hypoplasia, a common form of 
DDE. Our results were consistent with other research linking controlled HIV 
(with ART) to oral diseases and reinforce advocacies for public policies 
targeted at infants exposed/infected perinatally with HIV.",©2023 The Author(s). Published by MRE Press.,"DOI: 10.22514/jocpd.2023.007

Our previous study found that the number of iNKT cells in thymus of RA mice was 
reduced and the ratio of subsets was unbalanced, but the related mechanism 
remains unclear. We adopted an adoptive infusion of iNKT2 cells with specific 
phenotypes and functions to RA mice and used the α-Galcer treatment group as 
control. The findings revealed that: 1. Adoptive treatment of iNKT cells 
decreased the proportion of iNKT1 and iNKT17 subsets in the thymus of RA mice, 
and increased the proportion of iNKT2 subsets. 2. Following treatment with iNKT 
cells, the expression of PLZF in thymus DP T cells was increased whereas the 
expression of T-bet in thymus iNKT cells was decreased in RA mice. 3. Adoptive 
therapy reduced the modification levels of H3Kb7me3 and H3K4me3 in the promoter 
regions of Zbtb16 (encoding PLZF) and Tbx21 (encoding T-bet) gene in thymus DP T 
cells and iNKT cells, and the reduction of H3K4me3 was particularly significant 
in the cell treatment group. Furthermore, adoptive therapy also upregulated the 
expression of UTX (histone demethylase) in thymus lymphocytes of RA mice. As a 
result, it is hypothesized that adoptive therapy of iNKT2 cells may affect the 
level of histone methylation in the promoter region of important transcription 
factor genes for iNKT development and differentiation, thereby directly or 
indirectly correcting the imbalance of iNKT subsets in the thymus of RA mice.

humans. Although earlier studies focused on islets that fulfilled certain 
criteria (e.g. ≥15 CD45+ cells or ≥6 CD3+ cells), there is a fundamental lack of 
understanding of the infiltration dynamics in terms of its magnitude (i.e. how 
much) and extent (i.e. where). Here, we aimed to perform an in-depth 
characterisation of T cell infiltration by investigating islets with moderate 
(1-5 CD3+ cells) and high (≥6 CD3+ cells) infiltration in individuals with and 
without type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: Pancreatic tissue sections from 15 non-diabetic, eight double 
autoantibody-positive and ten type 1 diabetic (0-2 years of disease duration) 
organ donors were obtained from the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with 
Diabetes, and stained for insulin, glucagon, CD3 and CD8 by immunofluorescence. 
T cell infiltration was quantified in a total of 8661 islets using the software 
QuPath. The percentage of infiltrated islets and islet T cell density were 
calculated. To help standardise the analysis of T cell infiltration, we used 
cell density data to develop a new T cell density threshold capable of 
differentiating non-diabetic and type 1 diabetic donors.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that 17.1% of islets in non-diabetic donors, 33% 
of islets in autoantibody-positive and 32.5% of islets in type 1 diabetic donors 
were infiltrated by 1 to 5 CD3+ cells. Islets infiltrated by ≥6 CD3+ cells were 
rare in non-diabetic donors (0.4%) but could be found in autoantibody-positive 
(4.5%) and type 1 diabetic donors (8.2%). CD8+ and CD8- populations followed 
similar patterns. Likewise, T cell density was significantly higher in the 
islets of autoantibody-positive donors (55.4 CD3+ cells/mm2) and type 1 diabetic 
donors (74.8 CD3+ cells/mm2) compared with non-diabetic individuals (17.3 CD3+ 
cells/mm2), which was accompanied by higher exocrine T cell density in type 1 
diabetic individuals. Furthermore, we showed that the analysis of a minimum of 
30 islets and the use of a reference mean value for T cell density of 30 CD3+ 
cells/mm2 (the 30-30 rule) can differentiate between non-diabetic and type 1 
diabetic donors with high specificity and sensitivity. In addition, it can 
classify autoantibody-positive individuals as non-diabetic or type 1 
diabetic-like.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data indicates that the proportion of 
infiltrated islets and T cell density change dramatically during the course of 
type 1 diabetes, and these changes can be already observed in double 
autoantibody-positive individuals. This suggests that, as disease progresses, T 
cell infiltration extends throughout the pancreas, reaching the islets and 
exocrine compartment. While it predominantly targets insulin-containing islets, 
large accumulations of cells are rare. Our study fulfils the need to further 
understand T cell infiltration, not only after diagnosis but also in individuals 
with diabetes-related autoantibodies. Furthermore, the development and 
application of new analytical tools based on T cell infiltration, like the 30-30 
rule, will allow us to correlate islet infiltration with demographic and 
clinical variables with the aim of identifying individuals at the very early 
stages of the disease.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00125-023-05888-6

survival (PFS) of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) patients based on DNA 
methylation signature and clinicopathological characteristics. The DNA 
methylation profiles, transcriptome data, and clinical information of TGCT 
patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Univariate 
Cox, lasso Cox, and stepwise multivariate Cox regression were applied to 
identify a prognostic CpG sites-derived risk signature. Differential expression 
analysis, functional enrichment analysis, immunoinfiltration analysis, 
chemotherapy sensitivity analysis, and clinical feature correlation analysis 
were performed to elucidate the differences among risk groups. A prognostic 
nomogram integrating CpG sites-derived risk signature and clinicopathological 
features was further established and evaluated likewise. A risk score model 
based on 7 CpG sites was developed and found to exhibit significant differences 
among different survival, staging, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy subgroups. 
There were 1452 differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk 
groups, with 666 being higher expressed and 786 being lower expressed. Genes 
highly expressed were significantly enriched in immune-related biological 
processes and related to T-cell differentiation pathways; meanwhile, 
down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in extracellular matrix tissue 
organization-related biological processes and involved in multiple signaling 
pathways such as PI3K-AKT. As compared with the low-risk group, patients in the 
high-risk group had decreased lymphocyte infiltration (including T-cell and 
B-cell) and increased macrophage infiltration (M2 macrophages). They also showed 
decreased sensitivity to etoposide and bleomycin chemotherapy. Three clusters 
were obtained by consensus clustering analysis based on the 7 CpG sites and 
showed distinct prognostic features, and the risk scores in each cluster were 
significantly different. Multivariate Cox regression analysis found that the 
risk scores, age, chemotherapy, and staging were independent prognostic factors 
of PFS of TGCT, and the results were used to formulate a nomogram model that was 
validated to have a C-index of 0.812. Decision curve analysis showed that the 
nomogram model was superior to other strategies in the prediction of PFS of 
TGCT. In this study, we successfully established CpG sites-derived risk 
signature, which might serve as a useful tool in the prediction of PFS,

differentiation and expansion of effector and memory T cells that mediate 
immediate and long-term protection. Despite self-reliant rescue from infection, 
BCG vaccination, and treatment, long-term memory is rarely established against 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) resulting in recurrent tuberculosis (TB). 
Here, we show that berberine (BBR) enhances innate defense mechanisms against 
M.tb and stimulates the differentiation of Th1/Th17 specific effector memory 
(TEM), central memory (TCM), and tissue-resident memory (TRM) responses leading 
to enhanced host protection against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. 
Through whole proteome analysis of human PBMCs derived from PPD+ healthy 
individuals, we identify BBR modulated NOTCH3/PTEN/AKT/FOXO1 pathway as the 
central mechanism of elevated TEM and TRM responses in the human CD4+ T cells. 
Moreover, BBR-induced glycolysis resulted in enhanced effector functions leading 
to superior Th1/Th17 responses in human and murine T cells. This regulation of T 
cell memory by BBR remarkably enhanced the BCG-induced anti-tubercular immunity 
and lowered the rate of TB recurrence due to relapse and re-infection. These 
results thus suggest tuning immunological memory as a feasible approach to 
augment host resistance against TB and unveil BBR as a potential adjunct 
immunotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic against TB.","Copyright: © 2023 Pahuja et al. This is an open access article distributed under

CD8+ T cells are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS. However, the

peripheral blood granzyme K+ (GZMK+) CXCR6+CD8+ T cells had higher a proportion 
of clones shared with CD69+CD103-CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells in 
labial glands in pSS. CD69+CD103-CD8+ Trm cells featured by high expression of 
GZMK were more active and cytotoxic in pSS compared with their CD103+ 
counterparts. Peripheral blood GZMK+CXCR6+CD8+ T cells with higher CD122 
expression were increased and harbored a gene signature similar to Trm cells in 
pSS. Consistently, IL-15 was significantly elevated in pSS plasma and showed the

University.","Objective: Based on the functions of immunoregulation and signal transduction, 
septic peripheral blood sequencing and bioinformatics technology were used to 
screen potential core targets. Methods: Peripheral blood of 23 patients with 
sepsis and 10 normal volunteers underwent RNA-seq processing within 24 hours 
after admission to the hospital. Data quality control and differential gene 
screening were performed based on R language ( P < 0.01; log2FC ≥ 2). Gene 
function enrichment analysis was conducted on differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs). Then, target genes were submitted to STRING to constitute the PPI 
network, and GSE65682 were used to explore the prognostic relevance of potential 
core genes. Meta-analysis was used to verify the expression trends of core genes 
in the sepsis group. Then, cell line localization analysis of core genes in the 
5 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples (normal control = 2; systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome = 1; SEPSIS = 2) was performed. Results: A total 
of 1,128 DEGs were obtained between sepsis and normal group, of which 721 were 
upregulated and 407 downregulated. These DEGs were mainly enriched in 
leukocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, cell killing regulation, adaptive immune 
response regulation, lymphocyte-mediated immune regulation, and negative 
regulation of adaptive immune response. PPI network analysis results showed that 
CD160, KLRG1, S1PR5, and RGS16 were located in the core area, which are related 
to adaptive immune regulation, signal transduction, and intracellular 
components. The above four genes in the core area were found to be related to 
the prognosis of patients with sepsis, of which RGS16 was negatively correlated 
with the survival rate, and CD160, KLRG1, and S1PR5 were positively correlated. 
However, several public data sets showed that CD160, KLRG1, and S1PR5 were all 
downregulated in the peripheral blood of patients with sepsis, while RGS16 was 
upregulated in the sepsis group. Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that 
they were mainly expressed in NK-T cells. Conclusions: CD160, KLRG1, S1PR5, and 
RGS16 were mainly located in human peripheral blood NK-T cells. Sepsis 
participants expressed lower levels of S1PR5, CD160, and KLRG1, while sepsis 
participants expressed higher levels of RGS16. This suggests that they may be 
potential research targets for sepsis.",Copyright © 2023 by the Shock Society.,"DOI: 10.1097/SHK.0000000000002115

individualized cancer immunotherapy. Cryoablation-induced in situ autologous 
antigens are capable of activating systemic immunity with low damage. However, 
the dissipation of cancer fragments after cryoablation induces poor 
immunogenicity and short-time maintenance of immunological memory. To solve this 
challenge, a nanovaccine with functional grippers is proposed to largely enhance 
the in situ grasping of tumor fragments, combined with an immune adjuvant to 
further strengthen the immune-therapeutic effect. Herein, maleimide-modified 
Pluronic F127-chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating Astragalus polysaccharide 
(AMNPs) are developed. The AMNPs can capture multifarious and immunogenic tumor 
antigens generated through cryoablation, specifically target lymph nodes and 
facilitate lysosome escape to activate remote dendritic cells, and modulate T 
cell differentiation through cross-presentation, thereby breaking the 
immunosuppressive microenvironment to achieve durable and robust tumor-specific 
immunity. In the bilateral Lewis lung cancer tumor model, AMNP-mediated 
cryoablation can significantly regress primary tumors (with a tumor growth 
inhibition rate of 100%, and a recurrence rate of 0% (30 days) and 16.67% (60 
days)), inhibit untreated abscopal tumor growth (a decrease of about 3.84-fold 
compared with the saline group), and ultimately improve the long-term survival 
rate (83.33%). Collectively, the development of a lymph-node-targeted in situ 
cancer-cryoablation-mediated nanovaccine provides a promising approach for 
personalized cancer immunotherapy against metastatic cancers.","DOI: 10.1039/d3mh00092c

tolerance and prevent fatal autoimmunity in mice and humans. Expression of the T 
reg lineage-defining transcription factor FoxP3 is critically dependent upon T 
cell receptor (TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling. Here, we report that 
ten-eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes, which are DNA demethylases, are required 
early during double-positive (DP) thymic T cell differentiation and prior to the 
upregulation of FoxP3 in CD4 single-positive (SP) thymocytes, to promote Treg 
differentiation. We show that Tet3 selectively controls the development of CD25- 
FoxP3lo CD4SP Treg cell precursors in the thymus and is critical for 
TCR-dependent IL-2 production, which drive chromatin remodeling at the FoxP3 
locus as well as other Treg-effector gene loci in an autocrine/paracrine manner. 
Together, our results demonstrate a novel role for DNA demethylation in 
regulating the TCR response and promoting Treg cell differentiation. These

diagnosis and early management help in the preservation of fertility. However, 
its diagnosis is challenging. Preoperative diagnosis can be suspected in only 
23-66% of the cases and half of the patients operated for adnexal torsion have 
different diagnosis. This article thus aims to identify the diagnostic value of 
preoperative neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in adnexal torsion in comparison with 
other untwisted unruptured ovarian cysts.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted in the duration of five years 
from 1st January 2016 to 1st January 2020. The data about demographic 
parameters, hematological parameters, operative approach, operative technique, 
and histopathological reports were derived from an electronic database and 
documented on proforma. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. Logistic 
regression analysis and influence of each factor on preoperative diagnosis of 
Adnexal torsion was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were included in the article (adnexal torsion 
group n = 25, untwisted unruptured ovarian cyst group n = 100). There was no 
statistically significant difference in comparison to age, parity, and abortion 
between both groups. Most patients had undergone laparoscopic surgery which was 
based on surgeon's skill and preference. Nineteen (78%) patients in the adnexal 
torsion group underwent oophorectomy while infarcted ovary was seen in only 4 
cases. Among the blood parameters, only neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) >3 was 
found to be statistically significant under logistic regression analysis. Most 
common adnexal pathology to undergo torsion was serous cyst.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio can be a predictive marker 
for diagnosis of adnexal torsion and can differentiate it from untwisted 
unruptured ovarian cysts.",Copyright © 2023 Asmita Ghimire et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/3585189

del(17p), TP53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity, or multiple TP53 mutations). 
Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence

parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and immunological impairments. The present 
study aimed to evaluate T helper 17 (Th17) cells as a crucial modulator of the 
immune system and skeletal homeostasis in hemodialysis patients with impaired 
intact PTH (iPTH).
METHODS: In this research, blood samples were taken from ESRD patients with high 
(> 300 pg/mL), normal (150-300 pg/mL), and low (< 150 pg/mL) serum intact 
parathyroid hormone (iPTH( levels (n = 30 in each group). The frequency of Th17 
(CD4+ IL17+) cells was evaluated by flow cytometry in each group. The expression 
levels of Th17 cell-related master transcription factors, cytokines in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and Th cells, and the level of the 
mentioned cytokines were determined in the supernatant of PBMCs.
RESULTS: The number of Th17 cells remarkably increased in subjects with high 
iPTH against low and normal iPTH. Also, RORɣt and STAT3 levels were 
significantly higher in high iPTH ESRD patients than in other groups in the 
expression of mRNA and protein levels. These findings are confirmed by 
evaluating the IL-17 and IL-23 in the supernatant of cultured PBMCs and isolated 
Th cells.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that increased serum PTH levels in 
hemodialysis cases may be involved in increasing the differentiation of 
CD4 + cells to Th17 cells in PBMC.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","DOI: 10.1007/s11033-023-08306-7

melanocyte proliferation, migration and differentiation and its downregulation 
may result in depigmentation in vitiligo. Narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) phototherapy 
is known to enhance melanocyte migration from hair follicles to lesional 
epidermis; hence, it may have a role in the upregulation of LEF1.
OBJECTIVES: We intended to assess the expression of LEF1 both before and after 
NB-UVB therapy and correlate it with the extent of re-pigmentation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 30 patients of unstable 
non-segmental vitiligo were administered NB-UVB phototherapy for 24 weeks. Skin 
biopsies were obtained from acral and non-acral sites in all patients, both 
prior to initiation and after completion of phototherapy and LEF1 expression was 
measured.
RESULTS: Amongst the 16 patients who completed the study, at 24 weeks, all 
patients achieved > 50% re-pigmentation. However, > 75% re-pigmentation was 
achieved in only 11.1% of acral patches, whereas it was achieved in a 
significantly higher number of non-acral patches (66.6%) (p = 0.05). A 
significant increase was observed in the mean fluorescent intensity of the LEF1 
gene in both acral as well as non-acral areas at 24 weeks as compared to 
baseline (p = 0.0078), However, no difference was observed between acral and 
non-acral lesions in the LEF1 expression at 24 weeks or the change in LEF1 
expression from baseline.
CONCLUSION: LEF1 expression modulates the re-pigmentation of vitiligo lesions 
after treatment with NBUVB phototherapy.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

findings, ranging from mild dyspeptic complaints to mortal complications, such 
as gastrointestinal system perforation. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the potential blood parameters that can be used in the diagnosis of PUD and 
prediction of complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 80 patients with dyspeptic complaints, 83 
patients with PUD, and 108 patients with peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) who were 
treated in our hospital between January 2017 and December 2020 were included in 
the study. Clinical findings, laboratory data, and imaging methods were reviewed 
retrospectively.
RESULTS: The mean age of 271 (154 men, 117 women) patients included in the study 
was 56.04 ± 17.98 (mean ± standard deviation) years. The neutrophil-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume, white blood 
cell, C-reactive protein, and neutrophil values were higher in patients with PUP 
compared to other groups (p < 0.001 for all). In the PUD group, only red blood 
cell distribution width was significantly higher compared to the patient group 
with dyspeptic complaints. In the postoperative period, NLR and PLR were 
significantly higher in patients who developed severe complications according to 
the Clavien-Dindo classification compared to patients who developed mild 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that simple blood parameters can be used as 
diagnostic markers at different stages of PUD. NLR and PLR can be helpful in the 
diagnosis of PUP and red blood cell distribution width can be used to 
differentiate patients with peptic ulcer from dyspeptic patients. Additionally, 
NLR and PLR can be used to predict serious postoperative complications after PUP 
surgery.","DOI: 10.26355/eurrev_202302_31370

(CAR)-T cells has shown unprecedented clinical efficacy against B-cell 
malignancies, monotherapy with CAR-T cells has suboptimal clinical efficacy 
against solid tumors, probably because of the artificial signaling properties of 
the CAR. TRuC-T cells may address the suboptimal efficacy of existing CAR-T 
therapies for solid tumors. Here, we report that mesothelin (MSLN)-specific 
TRuC-T cells (referred to as TC-210 T cells) potently kill MSLN+ tumor cells in

xenograft mouse tumor models. When benchmarked against MSLN-targeted BBζ CAR-T 
cells (MSLN-BBζ CAR-T cells), TC-210 T cells show an overall comparable level of 
efficacy; however, TC-210 T cells consistently show faster tumor rejection 
kinetics that are associated with earlier intratumoral accumulation and earlier 
signs of activation. Furthermore, in vitro and ex vivo metabolic profiling 
suggests TC-210 T cells have lower glycolytic activity and higher mitochondrial

and form niches allowing the migration, activation, and survival of immune 
cells. Depending on their localization in the lymph node, these cells display 
heterogeneous properties and secrete various factors supporting the different 
activities of the adaptive immune response. LSCs participate in the transport of 
antigen from the afferent lymph as well as in its delivery into the T and B cell 
zones and organize cell migration via niche-specific chemokines. While marginal 
reticular cells (MRC) are equipped for initial B-cell priming and T zone 
reticular cells (TRC) provide the matrix for T cell-dendritic cell interactions 
within the paracortex, germinal centers (GC) only form when both T- and B cells 
successfully interact at the T-B border and migrate within the B-cell follicle 
containing the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network. Unlike most other LSCs, 
FDCs are capable of presenting antigen via complement receptors to B cells, 
which then differentiate within this niche and in proximity to T follicular 
helper (TFH) cells into memory and plasma cells. LSCs are also implicated in 
maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance. In mice, TRCs induce the alternative 
induction of regulatory T cells instead of TFH cells by presenting 
tissue-restricted self-antigens to naïve CD4 T cells via MHC-II expression. This 
review explores potential implications of our current knowledge of LSC 
populations regarding the pathogenesis of humoral immunodeficiency and 
autoimmunity in patients with autoimmune disorders or common variable

of immune tolerance and the production of autoantibodies against nucleic acids 
and other nuclear antigens (Ags). B lymphocytes are important in the 
immunopathogenesis of SLE. Multiple receptors control abnormal B-cell activation 
in SLE patients, including intrinsic Toll-like receptors (TLRs), B-cell 
receptors (BCRs), and cytokine receptors. The role of TLRs, notably TLR7 and 
TLR9, in the pathophysiology of SLE has been extensively explored in recent 
years. When endogenous or exogenous nucleic acid ligands are recognized by BCRs 
and internalized into B cells, they bind TLR7 or TLR9 to activate related 
signalling pathways and thus govern the proliferation and differentiation of B 
cells. Surprisingly, TLR7 and TLR9 appear to play opposing roles in SLE B cells, 
and the interaction between them is still poorly understood. In addition, other 
cells can enhance TLR signalling in B cells of SLE patients by releasing 
cytokines that accelerate the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. 
Therefore, the delineation of how TLR7 and TLR9 regulate the abnormal activation 
of B cells in SLE may aid the understanding of the mechanisms of SLE and provide 
directions for TLR-targeted therapies for SLE.","Copyright © 2023 Wen, Zhang, Wu, Liu, Fan, Han, Zhang, Ma, Chu and Shi.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1093208

deficiency diet (MCD) and the adoptive therapeutic effect of bone marrow cells 
on MAFLD was evaluated by detecting the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The mRNA expressions of low density 
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in liver immune cells 
(including T, NKT, Kupffer cells and other cell populations) were detected by 
real-time quantitative PCR. The bone marrow cells labeled with 5, 6- 
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) were injected into the 
tail vein of mice. The proportion of CFSE positive cells in liver tissue was 
observed by the frozen section, and the proportion of labeled cells in the liver 
and spleen was tracked by flow cytometry. The expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, 
NK1.1, CD11b and Gr-1 in CFSE labeled adoptive cells was detected by flow 
cytometry. The intracellular lipid content of NKT cells in liver tissue was 
evaluated by Nile Red lipid staining. Results The injury of liver tissue and the 
levels of serum ALT and AST in MAFLD mice were significantly reduced. At the 
same time, liver immune cells up-regulated the expression of IL-4 and LDLR. LDLR 
knockout mice induced more severe MAFLD after giving MCD diet. Bone marrow 
adoptive cells had a significant therapeutic effect and differentiated more NKT

performed a mathematical model analysis. The mathematical model analysis showed 
that the regulation of IKK activation by TRAF6 can reproduce TAK1 and IKK 
activities in TRAF6 null cells, and that the TRAF6 related signal-dependent 
inhibitor suppresses CARMA1 binding to Bcl10 in wild-type cells. These results 
suggest that TRAF6 contributes to the positive regulation of IKK activation via

circulatory system, and it serves a critical role in both immune function and 
surplus extracellular fluid drainage. Components of the lymphatic system include 
lymph, lymphatic vessels and plexuses, lymph nodes, lymphatic cells, and a 
variety of lymphoid organs. The pattern and form of lymphatic channels are more 
variable and complex but generally parallel those of the peripheral vascular 
system. The lymphatic system partly functions to convey lymphatic fluid, or 
lymph, through a network of lymphatic channels, filter lymphatic fluid through 
lymph nodes and return lymphatic fluid to the bloodstream, where it is 
eventually eliminated. Nearly all body organs, regions, and systems have 
lymphatic channels to collect the various byproducts that require elimination. 
Liver and intestinal lymphatics produce about 80% of the volume of lymph in the 
body. Notable territories of the body that do not appear to contain lymphatics 
include the bone marrow, epidermis, as well as other tissues where blood vessels 
are absent. The central nervous system was long considered to be absent of 
lymphatic vessels until they were recently identified in the cranial 
meninges. Moreover, a vessel appearing to have lymphatic features was also 
discovered in the eye. The lymphatic system is critical in a clinical context, 
particularly given that it is a major route for cancer metastasis and that the 
inflammation of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes is an indicator of pathology.  
Structure The lymphatic system includes numerous structural components, 
including lymphatic capillaries, afferent lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, 
efferent lymphatic vessels, and various lymphoid organs.  Lymphatic capillaries 
are tiny, thin-walled vessels that originate blindly within the extracellular 
space of various tissues. Lymphatic capillaries tend to be larger in diameter 
than blood capillaries and are interspersed among them to enhance their ability 
to collect interstitial fluid efficiently. They are critical in the drainage of 
extracellular fluid and allow this fluid to enter the closed capillaries but 
not exit due to their unique morphology. Lymphatic capillaries at their blind 
ends are composed of a thin endothelium without a basement membrane. The 
endothelial cells at the closed end of the capillary overlap but shift to open 
the capillary end when interstitial fluid pressure is greater 
than intra-capillary pressure. This process permits lymphocytes, interstitial 
fluid, bacteria, cellular debris, plasma proteins, and other cells to enter the 
lymphatic capillaries. Special lymphatic capillaries called lacteals exist in 
the small intestine to contribute to the absorption of dietary fats. Lymphatics 
in the liver contribute to a specialized role in transporting hepatic proteins 
into the bloodstream. The lymphatic capillaries of the body form large networks 
of channels called lymphatic plexuses and converge to form larger lymphatic 
vessels. Lymphatic vessels convey lymph, or lymphatic fluid, through their 
channels. Afferent (toward) lymphatic vessels convey unfiltered lymphatic fluid 
from the body tissues to the lymph nodes, and efferent (away) lymphatic vessels 
convey filtered lymphatic fluid from lymph nodes to subsequent lymph nodes or 
into the venous system. The various efferent lymphatic vessels in the body 
eventually converge to form two major lymphatic channels: the right 
lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct.  The right lymphatic duct drains most of 
the right upper quadrant of the body, including the right upper trunk, right 
upper extremity, and right head and neck. The right lymphatic trunk is a visible 
channel in the right cervical region just anterior to the anterior scalene 
muscle. Its origin and termination are variable in morphology, typically forming 
as the convergence of the right bronchomediastinal, jugular, and subclavian 
trunks, extending 1 to 2 centimeters in length before returning its contents to 
the systemic circulation at the junction of the right internal jugular, 
subclavian, and/or brachiocephalic veins.  The thoracic duct, also known as 
the left lymphatic duct or van Hoorne's canal, is the largest of the body's 
lymphatic channels. It drains most of the body except for the territory of the 
right superior thorax, head, neck, and upper extremity served by the right 
lymphatic duct. The thoracic duct is a thin-walled tubular vessel measuring 2 to 
6 mm in diameter. The length of the duct ranges from 36 to 45 cm. The thoracic 
duct is highly variable in form but typically arises in the abdomen at the 
superior aspect of the cisterna chyli, around the level of the twelfth thoracic 
vertebra (T12). The cisterna chyli, from which it extends, is an expanded 
lymphatic sac that forms at the convergence of the intestinal and lumbar 
lymphatic trunks extending along the L1-L2 vertebral levels. The cisterna chyli 
is present in approximately 40-60% of the population, and in its absence, 
the intestinal and lumbar lymphatic trunks communicate directly with the 
thoracic duct at the T12 level. As a result, the thoracic duct receives 
lymphatic fluid from the lumbar lymphatic trunks and chyle, composed of 
lymphatic fluid and emulsified fats, from the intestinal lymphatic trunk. 
Initially, the thoracic duct is located just to the right of the 
midline and posterior to the aorta. It exits the abdomen and enters the thorax 
via the aortic hiatus formed by the right and left crura of the diaphragm, side 
by side with the aorta. The thoracic duct then ascends in the thoracic 
cavity just anterior and to the right of the vertebral column between the aorta 
and azygous vein. At about the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra (T5), the 
thoracic duct typically crosses to the left of the vertebral column and 
posterior to the esophagus. From here, it ascends vertically and usually empties 
its contents into the junction of the left subclavian and left internal jugular 
veins in the cervical region. To ensure that lymph does not flow 
backward, collecting lymphatic vessels and larger lymphatic vessels have one-way 
valves. These valves are not present in the lymphatic capillaries. These 
lymphatic valves permit the continued advancement of lymph through the 
lymphatic vessels aided by a pressure gradient created by vascular smooth 
muscle, skeletal muscle contraction, and respiratory movements. However, it is 
important to note that lymphatic vessels also communicate with the venous system 
through various anastomoses. Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped 
tissues situated along lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes receive lymphatic fluid 
from afferent lymphatic vessels and convey lymph away through efferent lymphatic 
vessels. Lymph nodes serve as a filter and function to monitor lymphatic 
fluid/blood composition, drain excess tissue fluid and leaked plasma proteins, 
engulf pathogens, augment an immune response, and eradicate infection. Several 
organs in the body are considered to be lymphoid or lymphatic organs, given 
their role in the production of lymphocytes. These include the bone marrow, 
spleen, thymus, tonsils, lymph nodes, and other tissues. Lymphoid organs can be 
categorized as primary or secondary lymphoid organs. Primary lymphoid organs are 
those that produce lymphocytes, such as the bone marrow and thymus. Bone marrow 
is the primary site for the production of lymphocytes. The thymus is a glandular 
organ located anterior to the pericardium. It serves to mature and develop T 
cells, or thymus cell lymphocytes, in response to an inflammatory process or 
pathology. As individuals age, both their bone marrow and thymus reduce and 
accumulate fat. Secondary lymphoid organs serve as territories in which immune 
cells function and include the spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, and various mucous 
membranes, such as in the intestines. The spleen is a purplish, fist-sized organ 
in the left upper abdominal quadrant that contributes to immune function by 
serving as a blood filter, storing lymphocytes within its white pulp, and being 
a site for an adaptive immune response to antigens. The lingual tonsils, 
palatine tonsils, and pharyngeal tonsils, or adenoids, work to prevent pathogens 
from entering the body. Mucous membranes in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, 
and genitourinary systems also function to prevent pathogens from entering the 
body. Lymph Lymphatic fluid, or lymph, is similar to blood plasma and tends to 
be watery, transparent, and yellowish in appearance. Extracellular fluid leaks 
out of the blood capillary walls because of pressure exerted by the heart or 
osmotic pressure at the cellular level. As the interstitial fluid accumulates, 
it is picked up by the tiny lymphatic capillaries along with other substances to 
form lymph. This fluid then passes through the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes 
and finally enters the venous circulation. As the lymph passes through the lymph 
nodes, both monocytes and lymphocytes enter it.  Lymph is composed primarily of 
interstitial fluid with variable amounts of lymphocytes, bacteria, cellular 
debris, plasma proteins, and other cells. In the GI tract, lymphatic fluid is 
called chyle and has a milk-like appearance that is chiefly due to the presence 
of cholesterol, glycerol, fatty acids, and other fat products. The vessels that 
transport the lymphatic fluid from the GI tract are known as lacteals. 
Embryology The development of the lymphatic system is known from both human and 
animal, especially mouse studies. The lymphatic vessels form after the 
development of blood vessels, around six weeks post-fertilization. The 
endothelial cells that serve as precursors to the lymphatics arise from the 
embryonic cardinal veins. The process by which lymphatic vessels form is similar 
to that of the blood vessels and produces lymphatic-venous and 
intra-lymphatic anastomoses, but diverse origins exist for components of 
lymphatic vessel formation in different regions.  Six primary lymph sacs develop 
and are apparent about eight weeks post-fertilization. These include, from 
caudal to cranial, one cisterna chyli, one retroperitoneal lymph sac, two iliac 
lymph sacs, and two jugular lymph sacs. The jugular lymph sacs are the first 
to develop, initially appearing next to the jugular part of the cardinal 
vein. Lymphatic vessels then form adjacent to the blood vessels and connect the 
various lymph sacs. The lymphatic vessels primarily arise from the lymph sacs 
through the process of self-proliferation and polarized sprouting.  
Stem/progenitor cells play a huge role in forming lymphatic tissues and vessels 
by contributing to sustained growth and postnatally differentiating into 
lymphatic endothelial cells. Lymphatic channels from the developing gut connect 
with the retroperitoneal lymph sac and the cisterna chyli, situated just 
posteriorly. The lymphatic channels of the lower extremities and inferior trunk 
communicate with the iliac lymph sacs. Finally, lymphatic channels in the head, 
neck and upper extremities drain to the jugular lymph sacs. Additionally, a 
right and left thoracic duct form and connect the cisterna chyli with the 
jugular lymph sacs and form anastomoses that eventually produce the typical 
adult form. The lymph sacs then produce groups of lymph nodes in the fetal 
period. Migrating mesenchyme enters the lymph sacs and produces lymphatic 
networks, connective tissue, and other layers of the lymph nodes.","Copyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",PMID: 30020619

second dose were compared between those groups. COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine 
safety profile was very good and comparable in both groups. No severe AEs were 
observed. 30% of all patients reported some general AE after any vaccine dose 
and 46% - some local AE. Frequency of reported AEs did not differ between groups 
except for local hardening at injection site, more common in PIMS group (20% vs 
4% after any vaccine dose, p = 0,02). All AEs were benign, general AEs lasted up 
to 5 days and localised - up to 6 days after a vaccine dose. COVID-19 mRNA 
BNT162b2 vaccine did not induce any PIMS-like symptoms in any patient. We did 
not observe any significant T cells or B cells subset abnormalities in the PIMS 
group compared to the CONTROL group three weeks after a second dose except for 
terminally differentiated effector memory T cells that were higher in PIMS group 
(p < 0.0041). To sum up COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine in children with PIMS-TS 
was safe. Further studies are required to support our findings.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2023.02.072

to chemotherapy in breast cancer (BC). However, the immune status during 
chemotherapy remains unclear. We evaluated the sequential changes in peripheral 
systemic immunity markers in BC patients treated with various chemotherapeutic 
agents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the correlation between the peripheral 
systemic immunity markers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), absolute 
lymphocyte count (ALC) and the local cytolytic activity (CYT) score obtained by 
quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of 84 preoperative 
BC patients. Next, we observed the sequential changes in the peripheral systemic 
immunity markers during treatment with four anticancer drugs: oral 
5-fluorouracil derivative; S-1, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide; paclitaxel 
plus the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab, and 
eribulin in 172 HER2-negative advanced BC patients. Finally, we examined the 
correlation between the changes in the peripheral systemic immunity markers, 
time to treatment failure (TTF) and progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: A negative correlation was found between ALC and NLR. ALC-low and 
NLR-high cases were positively associated with CYT score-low cases. The ratio of 
ALC-increase and NLR-decrease varies depending on the anticancer drugs used. The 
responder group (TTF ≥3 months) had a higher NLR-decrease ratio than the 
nonresponder group (TTF <3 months). Patients with a high NLR-decrease ratio 
showed higher PFS.
CONCLUSION: The change in ALC or NLR varies according to the anticancer drugs, 
suggesting differential immunomodulatory effects of the drugs. Furthermore, the 
change in NLR reflects the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy in advanced BC.","Copyright © 2023, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

(PP2Cm)-deficient mice leads to hyper-activity of CD8+ T cells and enhanced 
anti-tumor immunity. CD8+ T cells from PP2Cm-/- mice upregulate glucose

BCAA supplementation recapitulates CD8+ T cell hyper-functions and synergizes 
with anti-PD-1, in line with a better prognosis in NSCLC patients containing 
high BCAAs when receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Our finding thus reveals that

both circulating and tissue-resident natural killer cells (NK) and innate 
lymphoid cells (ILC). These innate lymphocytes arise from a common CD34+ 
progenitor that differentiates into mature NK and ILCs. The successive stages in 
NK cell maturation are characterized by increased lineage restriction and 
changes to phenotype and function. Mechanisms of human NK cell development have 
not been fully elucidated, especially the role of signals that drive the spatial 
localization and maturation NK cells. Cytokines, extracellular matrix 
components, and chemokines provide maturation signals and influence the 
trafficking of NK cell progenitors to peripheral sites of differentiation. Here 
we present the latest advances in our understanding of NK and ILC development in 
peripheral sites, including secondary lymphoid tissues (i.e. tonsil). Recent 
work in the field has provided a model for the spatial distribution of NK cell 
and ILC developmental intermediates in tissue and generated further insights 
into the developmental niche. In support of this model, future studies using 
multifaceted approaches seek to fully map the developmental trajectory of human

cells were identified. They occur in the yolk sac and the intra-embryonic major 
arteries, in a narrow window of development. They arise sequentially, starting 
with primitive erythrocytes in the yolk sac blood islands, progressing to less 
differentiated erythromyeloid progenitors still in the yolk sac, and culminating 
with multipotent progenitors, some of which will generate the adult 
hematopoietic stem cell compartment. All these cells contribute to the formation 
of a layered hematopoietic system that reflects adaptative strategies to the 
fetal environment and the embryo's needs. It is mostly composed, at these 
stages, of erythrocytes and tissue-resident macrophages both of yolk sac origin, 
the latter persisting throughout life. We propose that subsets of lymphocytes of 
embryonic origin derive from a different intra-embryonic generation of 
multipotent cells occurring before the emergence of hematopoietic stem cell 
progenitors. These multipotent cells have a limited lifespan and generate cells 
that provide basic protection against pathogens before the adaptive immune 
system is functional, contribute to tissue development and homeostasis, and 
shape the establishment of a functional thymus. Understanding the properties of

≥ 50% of poorly differentiated components (PDC) in Japan. However, the optimal 
cutoff percentage of PDC for PDTC diagnosis remains controversial. Although high 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) correlates with the aggressiveness of 
papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), whether NLR is associated with the proportion of 
PDC in PTC remains unstudied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with the pure PTC (n = 664), PTC with < 50% PDC 
(n = 19), or PTC with ≥ 50% PDC (n = 26) who underwent surgery were 
retrospectively analyzed. Twelve-year disease-specific survival and preoperative 
NLR were compared among these groups.
RESULTS: Twenty seven patients died from thyroid cancer. The PTC with ≥ 50% PDC 
group (80.7%) showed significantly worse 12-year disease-specific survival than 
the pure PTC group (97.2%) (P < 0.001); however, the < 50% PDC group (94.7%) did 
not (P = 0.91). The PTC with ≥ 50% PDC group had a significantly higher NLR than 
the pure PTC (P < 0.001) and the PTC with < 50% PDC groups (P < 0.001), whereas 
there was no significant difference in the NLR between the pure PTC and the PTC 
with < 50% PDC groups (P = 0.48).
CONCLUSIONS: PTC with ≥ 50% PDC is more aggressive than either pure PTC or PTC 
with < 50% PDC, and NLR potentially reflects the PDC proportion. These results 
support the validity of 50% PDC as a cut-off for PDTC diagnosis and indicate the 
utility of NLR as a biomarker for PDC proportion.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2023.01.010

myelomonocytic cells and a subset of B lymphocytes. It was found to be 
differentially expressed between nodal marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and 
follicular lymphoma (FL). However, MNDA has not been widely used as a diagnostic 
marker in clinical practice. To validate its utility, we studied the expression 
of MNDA by immunohistochemistry in 313 cases of small B-cell lymphomas. Our 
results showed that MNDA was positive in 77.9% of MZL, 21.9% of mantle cell 
lymphoma, 28.9% of small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 2.6% 
of FL, and 25% of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. MNDA positivity varied from 68.0% 
to 84.0% among the 3 MZL subtypes, with extranodal MZL having the highest 
percentage. There was a statistically significant difference in MNDA expression 
between MZL and FL, mantle cell lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. CD43 expression was 
slightly more frequent in MNDA-negative MZL than in MNDA-positive MZL. Combined 
use of CD43 and MNDA improved the diagnostic sensitivity for MZL from 77.9% to 
87.8%. There was a trend of positive correlation between MNDA and p53 in MZL. In 
conclusion, MNDA is preferentially expressed in MZL among small B-cell lymphomas

procedures for primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) which are very common and a 
major public health problem in Turkey. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) 
is constitutively a T-cell defect in which naïve T-cell development is defective 
due to the mutations in genes responsible for the T cell differentiation and 
insufficient thymopoiesis. So, assessment of thymopoiesis is very important in 
the diagnosis of SCID and several combined immune deficiencies (CIDs).
METHODS: The purpose of this study is to examine thymopoiesis in healthy 
children via measurement of recent thymic emigrants (RTE); T lymphocytes that 
express CD4, CD45RA and CD31 to establish the RTE reference values in Turkish 
children. RTE were measured in the peripheral blood (PB) of 120 healthy infants 
and children between 0-6 years including cord blood samples, by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The absolute count of RTE cells and their relative ratios were found to 
be higher during the first year of life, being highest at the 6th month and 
tending to decrease significantly by age following birth (p=0.001). In the cord 
blood group, both values were lower than those in the 6-month-old group. The 
absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) varying by age, was found to reduce to 1850/mm³ 
in 4-years and after.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we evaluated normal thymopoiesis and established the normal 
reference levels of RTE cells in the peripheral blood of healthy children aged 
between 0-6 years. We believe that the collected data will contribute to early 
diagnosis and monitoring of immune reconstitution; serving as an additional fast 
and reliable marker for many PID patients especially for SCID including many 
other CIDs, especially in nations where newborn screening (NBS) via T cell 
receptor excision circles (TREC) has not yet become available.","DOI: 10.24953/turkjped.2021.5190

    Neuro Oncol. 2023 Apr 29;:","BACKGROUND: Plexiform neurofibromas can transform into atypical neurofibromas 
(ANF) and then further progress to aggressive malignant peripheral nerve sheath 
tumors (MPNST). ANF have been described to harbor distinct histological features 
and frequent loss of CDKN2A/B. However, histological evaluation may be 
rater-dependent, and detailed knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of 
malignant transformation is scarce. In general, malignant transformation can be 
accompanied by significant epigenetic changes, and global DNA methylation 
profiling is able to differentiate relevant tumor subgroups. Therefore, 
epigenetic profiling might provide a valuable tool to distinguish and 
characterize ANF with differing extent of histopathological atypia from 
neurofibromas and MPNST.
METHODS: We investigated 40 tumors histologically diagnosed as ANF and compared 
their global methylation profile to other peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
RESULTS: Unsupervised class discovery and t-SNE analysis indicated that 36/40 
ANF cluster with benign peripheral nerve sheet tumors with clear separation from 
MPNST. 21 ANF formed a molecularly distinct cluster in proximity to schwannomas. 
Tumors in this cluster had frequent heterozygous or homozygous loss of CDKN2A/B 
and significantly more lymphocyte infiltration than MPNST, schwannomas, and NF. 
Few ANF clustered closely with neurofibromas, schwannomas, or MPNST, raising the 
question, whether diagnosis based on histological features alone might pose a 
risk to both over- and underestimate the aggressiveness of these lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ANF with varying histological morphology show 
distinct epigenetic similarities and cluster in proximity to benign peripheral 
nerve sheath tumor entities. Future investigations should pay special respect to 
correlating this methylation pattern to clinical outcome.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), like Kawasaki disease (KD), is a 
potentially severe illness in children that appears to be a delayed, 
post-infectious complication of COVID-19. However, based on the relatively low 
MIS-C prevalence and high KD prevalence in Asian children, the clinical features 
of MIS-C are not fully recognized, especially after the spread of the Omicron 
variant. Here, we aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of MIS-C in a 
country with high KD prevalence.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 98 children diagnosed with KD and MIS-C 
admitted to Jeonbuk National University Hospital between January 1, 2021, and 
October 15, 2022. Twenty-two patients were diagnosed with MIS-C, following CDC 
diagnostic criteria for MIS-C. We reviewed medical records for clinical 
features, laboratory findings, and echocardiography.
RESULTS: Age, height, and weight were higher for patients with MIS-C than for 
those with KD. Lymphocytes percentage was lower, and the segmented neutrophil 
percentage was higher in the MIS-C group. The inflammation marker C-reactive 
protein was higher in the MIS-C group. Prothrombin time was prolonged in the 
MIS-C group. Albumin level was lower in the MIS-C group. The MIS-C group had 
lower potassium, phosphorus, chloride, and total calcium. Twenty-five percent of 
patients diagnosed with MIS-C had positive RT-PCR, and all the patients were 
N-type SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive. Albumin ≤3.85 g/dl effectively predicted 
MIS-C. Regarding echocardiography, the right coronary artery z-score, the 
absolute value of apical 4-chamber left ventricle longitudinal strain, and the 
ejection fraction (EF) was significantly lower in the MIS-C group. A month after 
diagnosis using echocardiographic data, all coronary artery z-scores had reduced 
significantly. EF and fractional shortening (FS) also improved one month after 
diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Albumin values can differentiate MIS-C and KD. In addition, a 
decrease in the absolute LV longitudinal strain value, EF, and FS was observed 
in the MIS-C group using echocardiography. Coronary artery dilatation was not 
evident at the initial diagnosis; however, a change in coronary artery size, EF, 
and FS was observed on follow-up echocardiography a month after diagnosis.","© 2023 You, Kim and You.","DOI: 10.3389/fped.2023.1088529

still unclear. Coronary arterial lesions (CALs) are a major complication of KD. 
Excessive inflammation and immunologic abnormities are involved in the 
pathogenesis of KD and CALs. Annexin A3 (ANXA3) plays crucial roles in cell 
migration and differentiation, inflammation, cardiovascular and membrane 
metabolic diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 
ANXA3 on the pathogenesis of KD and CALs. There were 109 children with KD in the 
KD group [which was divided into two groups: 67 patients with CALs in the KD-CAL 
group, and 42 patients with noncoronary arterial lesions (NCALs) in the KD-NCAL 
group] and 58 healthy children in the control (HC) group. Clinical and 
laboratory data were retrospectively collected from all patients with KD. The 
serum concentration of ANXA3 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 
(ELISAs). Serum ANXA3 levels were higher in the KD group than in the HC group 
(P < 0.05). There was a higher concentration of serum ANXA3 in the KD-CAL group 
than in the KD-NCAL group (P < 0.05). Neutrophil cell counts and serum ANXA3 
levels were higher in the KD group than in the HC group (P < 0.05) and quickly 
decreased when the patients were treated with IVIG after 7 days of illness. 
Platelet (PLT) counts and ANXA3 levels concurrently exhibited significant 
increases 7 days after onset. Furthermore, ANXA3 levels were positively 
correlated with lymphocyte and PLT counts in the KD and KD-CAL groups. ANXA3 may 
be involved in the pathogenesis of KD and CALs.","© 2023 Li, Liu, Jing, Liu and Yi.","DOI: 10.3389/fped.2023.1111788

to varicella zoster virus (VZV), but their functional properties during the 
reactivation acute vs latent phase of infection remain poorly defined.
METHODS: Here we assessed the functional and transcriptomic properties of 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in persons with acute herpes zoster (HZ) compared 
to those with a prior history of HZ infection using multicolor flow cytometry 
and RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: We found significant differences between the polyfunctionality of 
VZV-specific total memory, effector memory, and central memory CD4+ T cells in 
acute vs prior HZ. VZV-specific CD4+ memory T-cell responses in acute HZ 
reactivation had higher frequencies of IFN-γ and IL-2 producing cells compared 
to those with prior HZ. In addition, cytotoxic markers were higher in 
VZV-specific CD4+ T cells than non-VZV-specific cells. Transcriptomic analysis 
of ex vivo total memory CD4+ T cells from these individuals showed differential 
regulation of T-cell survival and differentiation pathways, including TCR, 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), T helper, inflammation, and MTOR signaling 
pathways. These gene signatures correlated with the frequency of IFN-γ and IL-2 
producing cells responding to VZV.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, VZV-specific CD4+ T cells from acute HZ individuals had 
unique functional and transcriptomic features, and VZV-specific CD4+ T cells as 
a group had a higher expression of cytotoxic molecules including Perforin, 
Granzyme-B, and CD107a.",Copyright © 2023 Pathogens and Immunity.,"DOI: 10.20411/pai.v7i2.560

occurring sulfolipids. The molecule triggers TREM2-related maturation of 
dendritic cells (DCs) and has shown promising adjuvant activity in a cancer 
vaccine model.
METHODS: the immunomodulatory activity of SULF A is tested in an allogeneic 
mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay based on monocyte-derived dendritic cells 
and naïve T lymphocytes from human donors. Flow cytometry multiparametric 
analyses and ELISA assays were performed to characterize the immune populations, 
T cell proliferation, and to quantify key cytokines.
RESULTS: Supplementation of 10 µg/mL SULF A to the co-cultures induced DCs to 
expose the costimulatory molecules ICOSL and OX40L and to reduce release of the 
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12. After 7 days of SULF A treatment, T lymphocytes 
proliferated more and showed increased IL-4 synthesis along with downregulation 
of Th1 signals such as IFNγ, T-bet and CXCR3. Consistent with these findings, 
naïve T cells polarized toward a regulatory phenotype with up-regulation of 
FOXP3 expression and IL-10 synthesis. Flow cytometry analysis also supported the 
priming of a CD127-/CD4+/CD25+ subpopulation positive for ICOS, the inhibitory 
molecule CTLA-4, and the activation marker CD69.
DISCUSSION: These results prove that SULF A can modulate DC-T cell synapse and 
stimulate lymphocyte proliferation and activation. In the hyperresponsive and 
uncontrolled context of the allogeneic MLR, the effect is associated to 
differentiation of regulatory T cell subsets and dampening of inflammatory 
signals.","Copyright © 2023 Barra, Gallo, Carbone, Ziaco, Dell’Isola, Affuso, Manzo, Nuzzo,

essential biological role in many processes, including apoptosis, cellular 
differentiation, growth, and immune responses. However, compared to mammalians, 
our knowledge of IGFBP5 in teleosts remains limited.
METHODS: In this study, TroIGFBP5b, an IGFBP5 homologue from golden pompano 
(Trachinotus ovatus) was identified. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was 
used to check its mRNA expression level in healthy condition and after 
stimulation. In vivo overexpression and RNAi knockdown method were performed to 
evaluate the antibacterial profile. We constructed a mutant in which HBM was 
deleted to better understand the mechanism of its role in antibacterial 
immunity. Subcellular localization and nuclear translocation were verified by 
immunoblotting. Further, proliferation of head kidney lymphocytes (HKLs) and 
phagocytic activity of head kidney macrophages (HKMs) were detected through 
CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence microscopy assay (IFA) and 
dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assay were used to evaluate the activity in 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κβ) pathway.
RESULTS: The TroIGFBP5b mRNA expression level was upregulated after bacterial 
stimulation. In vivo, TroIGFBP5b overexpression significantly improved the 
antibacterial immunity of fish. In contrast, TroIGFBP5b knockdown significantly 
decreased this ability. Subcellular localization results showed that TroIGFBP5b 
and TroIGFBP5b-δHBM were both present in the cytoplasm of GPS cells. After 
stimulation, TroIGFBP5b-δHBM lost the ability to transfer from the cytoplasm to 
the nucleus. In addition, rTroIGFBP5b promoted the proliferation of HKLs and 
phagocytosis of HKMs, whereas rTroIGFBP5b-δHBM, suppressed these facilitation 
effects. Moreover, the in vivo antibacterial ability of TroIGFBP5b was 
suppressed and the effects of promoting expression of proinflammatory cytokines 
in immune tissues were nearly lost after HBM deletion. Furthermore, TroIGFBP5b 
induced NF-κβ promoter activity and promoted nuclear translocation of p65, while 
these effects were inhibited when the HBM was deleted.
DISCUSSION: Taken together, our results suggest that TroIGFBP5b plays an 
important role in golden pompano antibacterial immunity and activation of the 
NF-κβ signalling pathway, providing the first evidence that the HBM of 
TroIGFBP5b plays a critical role in these processes in teleosts.","Copyright © 2023 Du, Zhou, Du, Zhang, Cao and Sun.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1126843

rate. Pathogens evade the host containment and bactericidal mechanisms by 
hijacking the coagulation and inflammation signaling pathways, leading to their 
rapid dissemination, thrombosis, organ dysfunction, and death. This study 
examines the hypothesis that measures of immunocoagulopathy upon admission could 
aid in the identification of patients with necrotizing fasciitis at high risk 
for in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: Demographic data, infection characteristics, and laboratory values from 
389 confirmed necrotizing fasciitis cases from a single institution were 
analyzed. A multivariable logistic regression model was built on admission 
immunocoagulopathy measures (absolute neutrophil, absolute lymphocyte, and 
platelet counts) and patient age to predict in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 19.8% for the 389 cases and 
14.6% for the 261 cases with complete measures of immunocoagulopathy on 
admission. A multivariable logistic regression model indicated that platelet 
count was the most important predictor of mortality, followed by age and 
absolute neutrophil count. Greater age, higher neutrophil count, and lower 
platelet count led to significantly higher risk of mortality. The model 
discriminated well between survivors and non-survivors, with an 
overfitting-corrected C-index of 0.806.
CONCLUSIONS: This study determined that measures of immunocoagulopathy and 
patient age at admission effectively prognosticated the in-hospital mortality 
risk of patients with necrotizing fasciitis. Given the accessibility of 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet count measurements determined from a 
simple complete blood-cell count with differential, future prospective studies 
examining the utility of these measures are warranted.

body from infection by various microbes. To prevent infectious diseases at the 
first line of defense, the establishment of pathogen-specific mucosal immunity 
by mucosal vaccine delivery is needed. Curdlan, a 1,3-β-glucan has a strong 
immunostimulatory effect when delivered as a vaccine adjuvant. Here, we 
investigated whether intranasal administration of curdlan and antigen (Ag) could 
induce sufficient mucosal immune responses and protect against viral infections. 
Intranasal co-administration of curdlan and OVA increased OVA-specific IgG and 
IgA Abs in both serum and mucosal secretions. In addition, intranasal 
co-administration of curdlan and OVA induced the differentiation of OVA-specific 
Th1/Th17 cells in the draining lymph nodes. To investigate the protective 
immunity of curdlan against viral infection, intranasal co-administration of 
curdlan with recombinant VP1 of EV71 C4a was administered and showed enhanced 
protection against enterovirus 71 in a passive serum transfer model using 
neonatal hSCARB2 mice, although intranasal administration of VP1 plus curdlan 
increased VP1-specific helper T cells responses but not mucosal IgA. Next, 
Mongolian gerbils were intranasally immunized with curdlan plus VP1, and they 
had effective protection against EV71 C4a infection, while decreasing viral 
infection and tissue damage by inducing Th17 responses. These results indicated 
that intranasal curdlan with Ag improved Ag-specific protective immunity by 
enhancing mucosal IgA and Th17 against viral infection. Our results suggest that

and is an important risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, heart 
failure, and kidney failure. Recent studies have demonstrated that activation of 
the immune system plays an important role in the occurrence and maintenance of 
HT. Thus, this research aimed to determine the immune-related biomarkers in HT. 
In this study, RNA sequencing data of the gene expression profiling datasets 
(GSE74144) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. 
Differentially expressed genes between HT and normal samples were identified 
using the software limma. The immune-related genes associated with HT were 
screened. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway 
enrichment analyses were performed using the program ""clusterProfiler"" of the R 
package. The protein-protein interaction network of these differentially 
expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs) was constructed based on the information 
from the STRING database. Finally, the TF-hub and miRNA-hub gene regulatory 
networks were predicted and constructed using the miRNet software. Fifty-nine 
DEIRGs were observed in HT. The Gene Ontology analysis indicated that DEIRGs 
were mainly enriched in the positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ions, 
peptide hormones, protein kinase B signaling, and lymphocyte differentiation. 
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that 
these DEIRGs were significantly involved in the intestinal immune network for 
IgA production, autoimmune thyroid disease, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, 
among others. From the protein-protein interaction network, 5 hub genes 
(insulin-like growth factor 2, cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing 
protein, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 
2A, and epidermal growth factor receptor) were identified. The receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis was performed in GSE74144, and all genes 
with an area under the curve of > 0.7 were identified as the diagnostic genes. 
Moreover, miRNA-mRNA and TF-mRNA regulatory networks were constructed. Our study 
identified 5 immune-related hub genes in patients with HT and demonstrated that 
they were potential diagnostic biomarkers for HT.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000032627

disease. The abnormal differentiation of Treg cells is important in 
pathogenesis. Despite previous studies showed that microRNAs (miRNAs, miR) are 
pivotal modulators of Treg cells, the effect of miRNAs on Treg cell 
differentiation and function is not clear. Our study wants to reveal the 
relationship of miR-143-3p with the differentiative ability and biofunction of 
Treg cells during the development of RA.
METHODS: The Expressing level of miR-143-3p and cell factor generation in 
peripheral blood (PB) of RA sufferers were identified by ELISA or RT-qPCR. The 
roles of miR-143-3p in Treg cell differentiation were studied via 
ShRNA/lentivirus transfection. Male DBA/1 J mice were separated into control, 
model, control mimics, and miR-143-3p mimics groups to analyze the 
anti-arthritis efficacy, the differentiative ability of Treg cells, and the 
expression level of miR-143-3p.
RESULTS: Our team discovered that the Expressing level of miR-143-3p was related 
to RA disease activities in a negative manner, and remarkably related to 
antiinflammation cell factor IL-10. In vitro, the expression of miR-143-3p in 
the CD4+ T cells upregulated the percentage of CD4+ CD25+ Fxop3+ cells (Tregs) 
and forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) mRNA expression. Evidently, miR-143-3p mimic 
intervention considerably upregulated the content of Treg cells in vivo, validly 
avoided CIA progression, and remarkably suppressed the inflammatory events of 
joints in mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that miR-143-3p could ameliorate CIA through 
polarizing naive CD4+ T cells into Treg cells, which may be a novel strategy to 
treat autoimmune diseases such as RA.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis published by Wiley

(Sero+) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are distinctly different disease 
subtypes. Patients with higher baseline EBV DNA titers seem to benefit less from 
anti-PD1 immunotherapy, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Tumor 
microenvironment (TME) characteristics could be the important factor affecting 
the efficacy of immunotherapy. Here, we illuminated the distinct multicellular 
ecosystems of EBV DNA Sero- and Sero+ NPCs from cellular compositional and 
functional perspectives at single-cell resolution.
METHOD: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of 28,423 cells from 
ten NPC samples and one non-tumor nasopharyngeal tissue. The markers, function, 
and dynamics of related cells were analyzed.
RESULTS: We found that tumor cells from EBV DNA Sero+ samples exhibit 
low-differentiation potential, stronger stemness signature, and upregulated 
signaling pathways associated with cancer hallmarks than that of EBV DNA Sero- 
samples. Transcriptional heterogeneity and dynamics in T cells were associated 
with EBV DNA seropositivity status, indicating different immunoinhibitory 
mechanisms employed by malignant cells depending on EBV DNA seropositivity 
status. The low expression of classical immune checkpoints, early-triggered 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response, global activation of IFN-mediated signatures, 
and enhanced cell-cell interplays cooperatively tend to form a specific immune 
context in EBV DNA Sero+ NPC.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we illuminated the distinct multicellular ecosystems 
of EBV DNA Sero- and Sero+ NPCs from single-cell perspective. Our study provides 
insights into the altered tumor microenvironment of NPC associated with EBV DNA 
seropositivity, which will help direct the development of rational immunotherapy 
strategies.","Copyright © 2023 Li, Lv, Liu, Lu, Jiang, Liang, Xia, Xiang, Xie and He.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1124066

antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Excess or inappropriate ASC differentiation can 
lead to antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, while impaired differentiation 
results in immunodeficiency.

regulators of terminal differentiation and antibody production.
RESULTS: We identified several new positive (Sec61a1, Hspa5) and negative

process. Other genes limited the proliferative capacity of activated B cells 
(Sumo2, Vcp, Selk). The largest number of genes identified in this screen (35) 
were required for antibody secretion. These included genes involved in 
endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and the unfolded protein response,

metastasis, and response to therapies has become increasingly clear, especially 
with the new emphasis on immunotherapies. To leverage the power of 
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models within a humanized immune 
microenvironment, three ovarian cancer PDXs were grown in humanized NBSGW 
(huNBSGW) mice engrafted with human CD34+ cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem 
cells. Analysis of cytokine levels in the ascites fluid and identification of 
infiltrating immune cells in the tumors demonstrated that these humanized PDX 
(huPDX) established an immune tumor microenvironment similar to what has been 
reported for patients with ovarian cancer. The lack of human myeloid cell 
differentiation has been a major setback for humanized mouse models, but our 
analysis shows that PDX engraftment increases the human myeloid population in 
the peripheral blood. Analysis of cytokines within the ascites fluid of huPDX 
revealed high levels of human M-CSF, a key myeloid differentiation factor as 
well as other elevated cytokines that have previously been identified in ovarian 
cancer patient ascites fluid including those involved in immune cell 
differentiation and recruitment. Human tumor-associated macrophages and 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were detected within the tumors of humanized 
mice, demonstrating immune cell recruitment to tumors. Comparison of the three 
huPDX revealed certain differences in cytokine signatures and in the extent of 
immune cell recruitment. Our studies show that huNBSGW PDX models reconstitute 
important aspects of the ovarian cancer immune tumor microenvironment, which may 
recommend these models for preclinical therapeutic trials.
SIGNIFICANCE: huPDX models are ideal preclinical models for testing novel 
therapies. They reflect the genetic heterogeneity of the patient population, 
enhance human myeloid differentiation, and recruit immune cells to the tumor 
microenvironment.",© 2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-22-0300

body weight, plays an important role in immunity and reproduction. Leptin 
signals via the specific membrane receptors expressed in most types of immune 
cells including dendritic cells (DCs) and thymocytes. Leptin enhances 
thymopoiesis and modulates T-cell-mediated immunity. Thymic plasmacytoid DCs 
(pDCs) are predominated in the thymus. They play an important role in thymocyte 
differentiation. We have analyzed whether leptin mediates its effects on human 
thymocytes by influencing on pDCs. We used leptin at concentration corresponding 
to its level during II-III trimesters of physiological pregnancy. We cultivated 
leptin-primed pDCs with autologous thymocytes and estimated the main thymocyte 
subsets expressing αβ chains of the T-cell receptor (αβTCR), natural regulatory 
T-cells (tTreg), natural T-helpers producing interleukin-17 (nTh17) and 
invariant natural killer T-cells (iNKT) in vitro. We have shown that leptin 
augmented CD86, CD276 expressions and depressed IL-10 productions by pDCs. 
Leptin-primed pDCs decreased the percentage of CD4+CD8+αβTCR+ thymocytes, 
increased CD4hiCD8-/loαβTCR+ cells. pDCs cultivated with leptin decreased the 
number of iNKT precursors, and did not change the number of tTreg and nTh17 
precursors. Thus, leptin's important role in regulation of thymic pDC abilities 
to influence on the thymocyte distribution was indicated in vitro.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.109912

identify a glycolytic intermediate metabolite, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), as a 
negative regulator of Th17 differentiation. PEP supplementation or inhibition of 
downstream glycolytic enzymes in differentiating Th17 cells increases 
intracellular PEP levels and inhibits interleukin (IL)-17A expression. PEP 
supplementation inhibits expression of signature molecules for Th17 and Th2

cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional and epigenetic signatures are 
important for understanding the details of its ontogeny. In our study, we 
applied scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to investigate the cell types, molecular 
features, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, and patterns of developing 
bovine skeletal muscle from gestational, lactational and adult stages. Detailed 
molecular analyses were used to dissect cellular heterogeneity, and we deduced 
the differentiation trajectory of myogenic cells and uncovered their dynamic 
gene expression profiles. SCENIC analysis was performed to demonstrate key 
regulons during cell fate decisions. We explored the future expression states of 
these heterogeneous cells by RNA velocity analysis and found extensive networks 
of intercellular communication using the toolkit CellChat. Moreover, the 
transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility modalities were confirmed to be 
highly concordant, and integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene 
expression revealed key transcriptional regulators acting during myogenesis. In 
bovine skeletal muscle, by scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis, different cell 
types such as adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, 
monocytes, pericyte cells and eight skeletal myogenic subpopulations were 
identified at the three developmental stages. The pseudotime trajectory 
exhibited a distinct sequential ordering for these myogenic subpopulations and 
eight distinct gene clusters were observed according to their expression 
pattern. Moreover, specifically expressed TFs (such as MSC, MYF5, MYOD1, FOXP3, 
ESRRA, BACH1, SIX2 and ATF4) associated with muscle development were predicted, 
and likely future transcriptional states of individual cells and the 
developmental dynamics of differentiation among neighbouring cells were 
predicted. CellChat analysis on the scRNA-seq data set then classified many 
ligand-receptor pairs among these cell clusters, which were further categorized 
into significant signalling pathways, including BMP, IGF, WNT, MSTN, ANGPTL, 
TGFB, TNF, VEGF and FGF. Finally, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq results were 
successfully integrated to reveal a series of specifically expressed TFs that 
are likely to be candidates for the promotion of cell fate transition during 
bovine skeletal muscle development. Overall, our results outline a single-cell 
dynamic chromatin/transcriptional landscape for normal bovine skeletal muscle 
development; these provide an important resource for understanding the structure 
and function of mammalian skeletal muscle, which will promote research into its 
biology.","© 2023 The Authors. Cell Proliferation published by Beijing Institute for Stem

cell-based therapies in the treatment of refractory malignancies. Primary T 
cells and NK cells armed with chimeric antigen receptors have achieved 
tremendous clinical success especially in patients with leukaemia and lymphoma. 
However, the autologous origin of these effector cells means that a single batch 
of laboriously engineered cells treats only a certain patient, leading to high 
cost, ununiform product quality, and risk of delay in treatment, and therefore 
results in restricted accessibility of these therapies to the overwhelming 
majority of the patients. Addressing these tricky obstacles calls for the 
development of universal immune cell products that can be provided 'off the

the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An 
adequate T cell response is essential not only for fighting disease but also for 
the creation of immune memory. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the T 
cells of patients with moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 not only at the 
time of illness but also 2 months after diagnosis to observe whether changes in 
this compartment persist. In this study, 166 COVID-19 patients were stratified 
into moderate/severe and critical disease categories. The maturation and 
activation of T cells were evaluated through flow cytometry. In addition, Treg 
cells were analysed. Until 15 days after diagnosis, patients presented a 
reduction in absolute and relative T lymphocyte counts. After 2 months, in 
moderate/severe patients, the counts returned to a similar level as that of the 
control group. In convalescent patients who had a critical illness, absolute T 
lymphocyte values increased considerably. Patients with active disease did not 
show differentiation of T cells. Nonetheless, after 2 months, patients with 
critical COVID-19 showed a significant increase in CD4+ EMRA (CD45RA+ effector 
memory) T lymphocytes. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients showed delayed T cell 
activation and reduced CD8+ suppressor T cells even 2 months after diagnosis. A 
reduction in CD4+ Treg cells was also observed, and their numbers returned to a 
similar level as that of healthy controls in convalescent patients. The results 
demonstrate that COVID-19 patients have a delayed activation and differentiation

of age and leads to serious cardiovascular complications such as coronary artery 
disease. The development of markers that can predict early is important to 
reduce the under- and misdiagnosis of KD. The aim of this research was to 
develop a diagnostic predictive model to differentiate Kawasaki disease (KD) 
from other febrile diseases using eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (ELR) and other 
biomarkers. We recruited a total of 190 children with KD and 1604 children with 
other febrile diseases. We retrospectively collected clinical information from 
the children, which included laboratory data on the day of admission, such as 
white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (HGB), calcitoninogen (PCT), hypersensitive 
c-reactive protein (CRP), snake prognostic nutritional index (PNI), peripheral 
blood neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
ELR. We performed analyses using univariate analysis, multivariate logistic 
regression, and column line plots, and evaluated the diagnostic parameters of 
the predictive models. ELR was significantly increased in patients with KD. 
After multivariate logistic regression, WBC, HGB, CRP, NLR, ELR and PNI were 
finally included as indicators for constructing the prediction model. The ROC 
curve analysis suggested that the C-index of the diagnostic prediction model was 
0.921. The calibration curve showed good diagnostic performance of the columnar 
graph model. The cut-off value of ELR alone for KD was 0.04, the area under the 
ROC curve was 0.809. Kids with KD show highly expressive level of ELR compared 
to children with febrile disease, which can be used to diagnose KD, and column 
line graphs constructed together with other indicators can help pediatricians to 
identify KD more effectively from febrile children.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-30463-9

(PD-1) associates with dysfunctional states of pathogen- or tumor-specific T 
cells. Accordingly, systemic antibody-mediated blockade of PD-1 has become a 
central target for immunotherapies but is also associated with severe toxicities 
due to loss of peripheral tolerance. Therefore, selective ablation of PD-1 
expression on adoptively transferred T cells through direct genetic knockout 
(KO) is currently being explored as an alternative therapeutic approach. 
However, since PD-1 might also be required for the regulation of physiological T 
cell function and differentiation, the suitability of PD-1 as an engineering 
target is controversial. In this study, we systematically investigated the 
maintenance of T cell functionality after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PD-1 KO in vivo 
during and after acute and chronic antigen encounter. Under all tested 
conditions, PD-1 ablation preserved the persistence, differentiation, and memory 
formation of adoptively transferred receptor transgenic T cells. Functional PD-1 
KO T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 could be 
robustly detected for over 390 d in a syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model, in 
which constant antigen exposure was provided by continuous B cell renewal, 
representing the longest in vivo follow-up of CAR-T cells described to date. 
PD-1 KO CAR-T cells showed no evidence for malignant transformation during the 
entire observation period. Our data demonstrate that genetic ablation of PD-1 
does not impair functionality and longevity of adoptively transferred T cells 
per se and therefore may be pursued more generally in engineered T cell-based 
immunotherapy to overcome a central immunosuppressive axis.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2200626120

The ability to maintain a capacity for durable proliferation of progenitor Tex 
is important, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we showed CD8+ progenitor 
Tex pretreated with decitabine, a low-dose DNA demethylating agent, had enhanced 
proliferation and effector function against tumors after anti-PD-1 treatment in 
vitro. Treatment with decitabine plus anti-PD-1 promoted the activation and 
expansion of tumor-infiltrated CD8+ progenitor Tex and efficiently suppressed 
tumor growth in multiple tumor models. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling 
of tumor-infiltrated T cells demonstrated that the combination of decitabine 
plus anti-PD-1 markedly elevated the clonal expansion and cytolytic activity of 
progenitor Tex compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and restrained CD8+ T cell 
terminal differentiation. Strikingly, decitabine plus anti-PD-1 sustained the 
expression and activity of the AP-1 transcription factor JunD, which was reduced 
following PD-1 blockade therapy. Downregulation of JunD repressed T cell 
proliferation, and activation of JNK/AP-1 signaling in CD8+ T cells enhanced the 
antitumor capacity of PD-1 inhibitors. Together, epigenetic agents remodel CD8+

usually homogeneously retained or lost. Rare lesions may show a heterogeneous 
pattern of MMR protein expression. We evaluated MMR protein expression (MLH1, 
MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) in 200 CRCs, identifying 3 groups with proficient MMR 
protein expression (MMRp), deficient MMR protein expression (MMRd), and 
heterogeneous MMR protein expression (MMRh). MMRh tumors were microdissected on 
the basis of the expression of the heterogeneous marker. DNA was extracted and 
subjected to targeted sequencing. RNA was purified from bulk tumors of all MMRh 
cases and in a control series of 15 MMRp and 10 MMRd CRCs and analyzed using the 
PanCancer IO 360 Panel (NanoString Technologies). Twenty-nine of the 200 cases 
(14.5%) were MMRd. Nine cases (4.5%) showed a heterogeneous pattern of MMR 
expression, with 6 tumors harboring concomitant loss of one of the other MMR 
proteins, thus featuring areas with double loss at immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
testing (MMRh double-loss cases). Four of the 6 MMRh double-loss cases were 
suitable for a separate sequence variant analysis of IHC double-negative and IHC 
single-negative components of the tumor. In all lesions, both components 
exhibited a high tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, a significant 
increase in TMB in the double-negative components was observed (mean TMB: 
negative, 70 mut/Mb vs positive, 59 mut/Mb) because of a higher number of 
subclonal variants compared with the other component. Comparative gene 
expression analyses among MMRd, MMRp, and MMRh CRCs highlighted differential 
gene expression patterns and an increased number of tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes in MMRh lesions, which is also characterized by a substantial 
population of exhausted CD8+ lymphocytes. We describe a unique subgroup of CRCs

Therefore, this study aimed to compare preoperative NLR of uterine 
leiomyosarcoma (LMS) with leiomyoma and secondary objective aimed to identify 
the clinical characteristics to distinguish between uterine LMS and uterine 
leiomyoma including the appropriate NLR cut off value to differentiate LMS from 
leiomyoma.
METHODS: This was a matched case-controlled study with 1:4 ratio. We collected 
data of patients with uterine LMS and leiomyoma from 2011 to 2020 at King 
Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Patients with uterine LMS (case group) and 
leiomyoma (control group) were matched in terms of year of the surgery and size 
of the uterine mass. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22.0 
and STATA version 17. Conditional logistic regression analysis with a p-value of 
<0.05 was used.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients who were diagnosed with uterine LMS met the 
inclusion criteria; 13 patients who had incomplete data and one patient who was 
had concurrent breast cancer were excluded. Thirteen patients were included in 
the final analysis. From 2,587 patients in control group; 52 patients were 
matched. The baseline characteristics in both groups were comparable except for 
menopausal status Women with uterine LMS had a higher NLR than those with 
leiomyoma (mean, 4.56 ± 2.5 and 2.4 ± 1.15 in the case and control groups, 
respectively). Conditional logistic regression determined that the NLR cut-off 
value of 2.8 was a statistically significant factor for determining uterine LMS 
(OR = 3.24; 95% CI 1.01-10.43). No significant difference was found in the other 
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were diagnosed with uterine LMS had a significantly 
higher NLR than those diagnosed with leiomyoma. The NLR is a simple and 
effective method for predicting the presence of a uterine LMS in patients who 
are pre-operatively diagnosed with a uterine mass.","DOI: 10.31557/APJCP.2023.24.2.701

poor outcomes in septic patients. Esmolol was reported to improve survival by 
modulating immune responses in septic shock. Whether esmolol could alleviate 
sepsis-induced immunosuppression and the optimal dose are unclear. Methods: Four 
hours after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), Wistar rats were randomized into 
CLP, CLP + E-5 (esmolol: 5 mg·kg -1 ·h -1 ) and CLP + E-18 (esmolol: 18 mg·kg -1 
·h -1 ) groups. Eight rats were underwent sham operation. Eighteen hours after 
CLP, hemodynamics and organ histological injuries were evaluated, peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells apoptosis and T-lymphocyte subsets counts were 
determined by flow cytometry, and the expression of p-Akt, Bcl-2, cleaved 
Caspase-3, and p-Erk1/2 in splenic CD4 + T-lymphocytes was determined by western 
blot and immunohistochemistry. β 1 -Adrenoreceptor expressions were evaluated 
using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Results: 
Cecal ligation and puncture induced tachycardia, hypotension, hyperlactatemia, 
and multiple organ injury. Heart rate was unchanged in the CLP + E-5 group but 
decreased in the CLP + E-18 group. Hypotension, lactatemia, and multiple organ 
injuries were improved only in the CLP + E-5 group. T-lymphocyte apoptosis and T 
H 2/T H 1 ratio was decreased in CLP + E-5 but not in CLP + E-18. p-Akt and 
Bcl-2 expressions were increased, while cleaved Caspase-3 and p-Erk1/2 
expressions were decreased in CLP + E-5. β 1 -Adrenoreceptor expressions were 
unchanged in both CLP + E-5 and CLP + E-18 groups. Conclusions: Low dose of 
esmolol reduced T-lymphocyte apoptosis and restored T H 2/T H 1 ratio in septic 
shock. Esmolol might modulate Akt/Bcl-2/Caspase-3 pathway to relieve 
T-lymphocyte apoptosis and inhibit Erk1/2 activity to decrease T H 0

hematological malignancies but has yet to achieve similar success in solid 
tumors due to a lack of persistence and function in the tumor microenvironment. 
We previously reported the augmentation of CAR T cell therapy in an engineered 
solid tumor model through the secretion of anti-PD-1 single-chain fragment 
variable region (scFv), as shown by enhanced CAR T cell antitumor efficacy, 
expansion, and vitality. We have since improved the platform to create a 
superior cellular product-CAR T cells secreting single-chain trimeric 4-1BB 
ligand fused to anti-PD-1 scFv (αPD1-41BBL). 4-1BB signaling promotes cytotoxic 
T lymphocyte proliferation and survival but targeting 4-1BB with agonist 
antibodies in the clinic has been hindered by low antitumor activity and high 
toxicity. CAR T cells using 4-1BB endodomain for costimulatory signals have 
demonstrated milder antitumor response and longer persistence compared to CAR T 
cells costimulated by CD28 endodomain. We have, for the first time, engineered 
CD28-costimulated CAR T cells to secrete a fusion protein containing the soluble 
trimeric 4-1BB ligand. In vitro and in vivo, CAR19.αPD1-41BBL T cells exhibited 
reduced inhibitory receptor upregulation, enhanced persistence and 
proliferation, and a less differentiated memory status compared to CAR T cells 
without additional 4-1BB:4-1BBL costimulation. Accordingly, CAR19.αPD1-41BBL T 
cell-treated mice displayed significantly improved tumor growth control and

time on ART was associated with a reduced frequency of adaptive NK cells. In 
general, the frequency and functionality of NK cells following AD stimulation 
did not differ significantly between treated CMV+PLWH and CMV+HIV- persons, 
suggesting that HIV infection, per se, did not compromise AD NK cell function.

inflammation and lymphomas is often difficult. The diagnosis of hepatic lymphoma 
in humans relies on recognition of specific patterns of lymphocytic infiltrates 
and clonality testing of antigen receptors. Herein, we defined similar patterns 
of lymphocytic infiltrates in hepatic biopsies of cats and correlated them with 
clonality to determine which patterns are predictive of lymphoma. A 
retrospective study was performed on surgical biopsies from 44 cats. The 
immunophenotype was characterized using CD3 and CD20 on all 44 samples. All 44 
samples were tested using PCR for T-cell receptor gamma-gene rearrangements. PCR 
for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements was performed on 24 of these 
cats. Four patterns of lymphocytic infiltrates were characterized: (1) tightly 
periportal, (2) periportal and centrilobular, (3) nodular, and (4) periportal 
with sinusoidal extension. Other histomorphologic features (fibrosis, biliary 
hyperplasia, bile ductopenia, bile duct targeting, hepatic hematopoiesis, 
lipogranulomas, lymphonodular aggregates, other inflammatory cells) were also 
evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the lymphocytic patterns to 
diagnose lymphomas were determined using Bayesian Hui-Walter analysis (BLCM) 
against clonality results. Lymphocytic patterns 2, 3, and 4 accurately diagnosed 
hepatic lymphomas with a sensitivity and specificity of 82% (CI 95%: 0.65, 0.96) 
and 77% (CI 95%: 0.54, 1.00), respectively. None of the other microscopic 
features evaluated were predictive of a lymphoma or inflammation. Our study 
identified specific patterns of lymphocytic infiltration that differentiate 
feline hepatic lymphoma from inflammation while other histologic features were 
not associated with an accurate diagnosis.","DOI: 10.3390/vetsci10020127

circulatory system that can be manifested as spasm and thrombosis. It can occur 
as allergic, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic, or anaphylactoid reactions 
associated with the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and from 
other interrelated and interacting inflammatory cells, including macrophages and 
lymphocytes. A platelet subset with high- and low-affinity IgE surface receptors 
is also involved in this process. Whereas the heart, and particularly the 
coronary arteries, constitute the primary targets of inflammatory mediators, the 
mesenteric, cerebral, and peripheral arteries are also vulnerable. Kounis 
syndrome is caused by a variety of factors, including drugs, foods, 
environmental exposure, clinical conditions, stent implantation, and vaccines. 
We report a unique case of a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of 
allergy to human albumin, alcoholic cirrhosis, and esophageal varices, who was 
admitted due to multiple episodes of hematemesis. Due to low hemoglobin levels, 
he was transfused with 3 units of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma 
without any adverse reactions. On the third day of hospitalization, severe 
thrombocytopenia was observed and transfusion of platelets was initiated. 
Immediately following platelet infusion, the patient developed chest discomfort, 
skin signs of severe allergic reaction, and hemodynamic instability. The 
electrocardiogram revealed ST segment elevation in the inferior leads. Given the 
strong suspicion of Kounis syndrome/allergic coronary spasm, the patient was 
treated with anti-allergic treatment only, without any anti-platelet therapy. 
The clinical status of the patient gradually improved and the 
electrocardiographic changes reverted to normal. Based on these findings, Kounis 
hypersensitivity-associated acute coronary syndrome, specifically, type I Kounis 
syndrome, was diagnosed. Although platelet transfusion can be a life-saving 
therapy, each blood transfusion carries a substantial risk of adverse reactions. 
The aims of this report are to expand the existing knowledge of patient 
responses to blood transfusion and provide information on the incidence of 
various severe transfusion reactions to all blood components and especially to 
platelets. To the best of our knowledge, Kounis syndrome induced by platelet 
transfusionhas never been previously reported. Hypersensitivity to platelet 
external membrane glycoproteins in an atopic patient seems to be the possible 
etiology. Despite that Kounis syndrome remains an under-diagnosed clinical 
entity in everyday practice, it should always be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes.","DOI: 10.3390/vaccines11020220

autoimmune diseases. Herein, we show that itaconate, an immunomodulatory 
metabolite, inhibits Th17 cell differentiation and promotes Treg cell 
differentiation by orchestrating metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. 
Mechanistically, itaconate suppresses glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation 
in Th17- and Treg-polarizing T cells. Following treatment with itaconate, the 
S-adenosyl-L-methionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio and 2-hydroxyglutarate

Treg cells, respectively. Consequently, these metabolic changes are associated 
with altered chromatin accessibility of essential transcription factors and key

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Solid tumors pose unique roadblocks to treatment with chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, including limited T-cell persistence, 
inefficient tumor infiltration, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. 
To date, attempts to overcome these roadblocks have been unsatisfactory. Herein, 
we reported a strategy of combining Runx3 (encoding RUNX family transcription 
factor 3)-overexpression with ex vivo protein kinase B (AKT) inhibition to 
generate CAR-T cells with both central memory and tissue-resident memory 
characteristics to overcome these roadblocks.
METHODS: We generated second-generation murine CAR-T cells expressing a CAR 
against human carbonic anhydrase 9 together with Runx3-overexpression and 
expanded them in the presence of AKTi-1/2, a selective and reversible inhibitor 
of AKT1/AKT2. We explored the influence of AKT inhibition (AKTi), 
Runx3-overexpression, and their combination on CAR-T cell phenotypes using flow 
cytometry, transcriptome profiling, and mass cytometry. The persistence, 
tumor-infiltration, and antitumor efficacy of CAR-T cells were evaluated in 
subcutaneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor models.
RESULTS: AKTi generated a CD62L+central memory-like CAR-T cell population with 
enhanced persistence, but promotable cytotoxic potential. Runx3-overexpression 
cooperated with AKTi to generate CAR-T cells with both central memory and 
tissue-resident memory characteristics. Runx3-overexpression enhanced the 
potential of CD4+CAR T cells and cooperated with AKTi to inhibit the terminal 
differentiation of CD8+CAR T cells induced by tonic signaling. While AKTi 
promoted CAR-T cell central memory phenotype with prominently enhanced expansion 
ability, Runx3-overexpression promoted the CAR-T cell tissue-resident memory 
phenotype and further enhanced persistence, effector function, and 
tumor-residency. These novel AKTi-generated Runx3-overexpressing CAR-T cells 
exhibited robust antitumor activity and responded well to programmed cell death 
1 blockade in subcutaneous PDAC tumor models.
CONCLUSIONS: Runx3-overexpression cooperated with ex vivo AKTi to generate CAR-T 
cells with both tissue-resident and central memory characteristics, which 
equipped CAR-T cells with better persistence, cytotoxic potential, and 
tumor-residency ability to overcome roadblocks in the treatment of solid tumors.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

Chinese herbal formula, which has the effect of clearing heat and detoxifying 
toxins, dispersing swellings, activating blood circulation, and relieving pain. 
It is usually applied to treat various autoimmune diseases, including Rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA).
AIM OF THE STUDY: The migration of T lymphocytes plays an indispensable role in 
the pathogenesis of RA. Our previous studies demonstrated that modified Xianfang 
Huoming Yin (XFHM) could modulate the differentiation of T, B, and NK cells, and 
contribute to the restoration of immunologic balance. It also could downregulate 
the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by regulating the activation of 
NF-κ B and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in the collagen-induced arthritis mouse 
model. In this study, we want to investigate whether XFHM has therapeutic 
effects on the inflammatory proliferation of rat fibroblast-like synovial cells 
(FLSs) by interfering with the migration of T lymphocytes in vitro experiments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: High performance liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization/mass spectrometer system was used to identify the constituents of the 
XFHM formula. A co-culture system of rat fibroblast-like synovial cells 
(RSC-364 cells) and peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated by interleukin-1 
beta (IL-1β) was used as the cell model. IL-1β inhibitor (IL-1βRA) was used as a 
positive control medicine, and two concentrations (100 μg/mL and 250 μg/mL) of 
freeze-dried XFHM powder were used as intervention measure. The lymphocyte 
migration levels were analyzed by the Real-time xCELLigence analysis system 
after 24 h and 48 h of treatment. The percentage of CD3+CD4+ T cells and 
CD3+CD8+ T cells, and the apoptosis rate of FLSs were detected by flow 
cytometry. The morphology of RSC-364 cells was observed by hematoxylin-eosin 
staining. The protein expression of key factors for T cell differentiation and 
NF-κ B signaling pathway-related proteins in RSC-364 cells were examined by 
western-blot analysis. The migration-related cytokines levels of P-selectin, 
VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 in the supernatant were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Twenty-one different components in XFHM were identified. The migration 
CI index of T cells was significantly decreased in treatment with XFHM. XFHM 
also could significantly downregulate the levels r of CD3+CD4+T cells and 
CD3+CD8+T cells that migrated to the FLSs layer. Further study found that XFHM 
suppresses the production of P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Meanwhile, it 
downregulated the protein levels of T-bet, ROR γ t, IKKα/β, TRAF2, and NF-κ B 
p50, upregulated the expression of GATA-3 and alleviated synovial cells 
inflammation proliferation, contributing to the FLSs apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: XFHM could attenuate the inflammation of synovium by inhibiting T 
lymphocyte cell migration, regulating differentiation of T cells through 
modulating the activation of the NF-κ B signaling pathway.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2023.116297

population with a potent suppressor profile that regulates immune responses. 
These cells are one of the main components of the microenvironment of several 
diseases, including solid and hematologic tumors, autoimmunities, and chronic 
inflammation. However, their wide use in studies is limited due to they 
comprehend a rare population, which is difficult to isolate, expand, 
differentiate, and maintain in culture. Additionally, this population has a 
complex phenotypic and functional characterization.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a protocol for the in vitro production of MDSC-like 
population from the differentiation of the immature myeloid cell line THP-1.
METHODS: We stimulated THP-1 with G-CSF (100 ng/mL) and IL-4 (20 ng/mL) for 
seven days to differentiate into the MDSC-like profile. At the end of the 
protocol, we characterized these cells phenotypically and functionally by 
immunophenotyping, gene expression analysis, cytokine release dosage, lymphocyte 
proliferation, and NK-mediated killing essays.
RESULTS: We differentiate THP-1 cells in an MDSC-like population, named 
THP1-MDSC-like, which presented immunophenotyping and gene expression profiles 
compatible with that described in the literature. Furthermore, we verified that 
this phenotypic and functional differentiation did not deviate to a macrophage 
profile of M1 or M2. These THP1-MDSC-like cells secreted several 
immunoregulatory cytokines into the microenvironment, consistent with the 
suppressor profile related to MDSC. In addition, the supernatant of these cells 
decreased the proliferation of activated lymphocytes and impaired the apoptosis 
of leukemic cells induced by NK cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an effective protocol for MDSC in vitro production 
from the differentiation of the immature myeloid cell line THP-1 induced by 
G-CSF and IL-4. Furthermore, we demonstrated that THP1-MDSC-like suppressor 
cells contribute to the immune escape of AML cells. Potentially, these 
THP1-MDSC-like cells can be applied on a large-scale platform, thus being able 
to impact the course of several studies and models such as cancer, 
immunodeficiencies, autoimmunity, and chronic inflammation.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jim.2023.113441

ivermectin group and the control groups. Ivermectin was administered 
subcutaneously at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg to the goats in the ivermectin group on 
days 0, 7, and 21. Blood samples were collected from the vena jugularis on days 
0, 21, 45, and 90. The cluster of differentiation4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly

microenvironment. A quantitative understanding of the tumor-MDSC interactions 
that influence disease progression is critical, and currently lacking. We 
developed a mathematical model of metastatic growth and progression in 
immune-rich tumor microenvironments. We modeled the tumor-immune dynamics with 
stochastic delay differential equations and studied the impact of delays in MDSC 
activation/recruitment on tumor growth outcomes. In the lung environment, when 
the circulating level of MDSCs was low, the MDSC delay had a pronounced impact 
on the probability of new metastatic establishment: blocking MDSC recruitment 
could reduce the probability of metastasis by as much as 50%. To predict 
patient-specific MDSC responses, we fit to the model individual tumors treated 
with immune checkpoint inhibitors via Bayesian parameter inference. We reveal 
that control of the inhibition rate of natural killer (NK) cells by MDSCs had a 
larger influence on tumor outcomes than controlling the tumor growth rate 
directly. Posterior classification of tumor outcomes demonstrates that 
incorporating knowledge of the MDSC responses improved predictive accuracy from 
63% to 82%. Investigation of the MDSC dynamics in an environment low in NK cells 
and abundant in cytotoxic T cells revealed, in contrast, that small MDSC delays 
no longer impacted metastatic growth dynamics. Our results illustrate the 
importance of MDSC dynamics in the tumor microenvironment overall and predict 
interventions promoting shifts toward less immune-suppressed states. We propose

prevalent nasal diseases where both type 2 inflammation and immunoglobulin E 
(IgE) may play important roles. Although they can exist independently or 
comorbidly, subtle but important differences exist in immunopathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize current knowledge of pathophysiological roles of B 
lineage cells and IgE in AR and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).
METHODS: Searched PubMed database, reviewed AR and CRSwNP-related literature, 
and discussed disease diagnosis, comorbidity, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and 
treatment. Similarities and differences in B-cell biology and IgE are compared 
in the 2 conditions.
RESULTS: Both AR and CRSwNP have evidence for pathological type 2 inflammation, 
B-cell activation and differentiation, and IgE production. However, distinctions 
exist in the clinical and serological profiles at diagnosis, as well as 
treatments utilized. B-cell activation in AR may more frequently be regulated in 
the germinal center of lymphoid follicles, whereas CRSwNP may occur via 
extrafollicular pathways although controversies remain in these initial 
activating events. Oligoclonal and antigen-specific IgE maybe predominate in AR, 
but polyclonal and antigen-nonspecific IgE may predominate in CRSwNP. Omalizumab 
has been shown efficacious in treating both AR and CRSwNP in multiple clinical 
trials but is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-IgE biologic 
to treat CRSwNP or allergic asthma. Staphylococcus aureus frequently colonizes 
the nasal airway and has the ability to activate type two responses including 
B-cell responses although the extent to which it modulates AR and CRSwNP disease 
severity is being investigated.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights current knowledge of the roles of B cells and 
IgE in the pathogenesis of AR and CRSwNP and a small comparison between the 2 
diseases. More systemic studies should be done to elevate the understanding of 
these diseases and their treatment.","DOI: 10.1177/19458924221147770

last-generation QuantiFERON TB-Plus (QFT-Plus), are effective in aiding the 
diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) infection but cannot distinguish latent TB 
subjects from active TB patients. The aim of this study was to prospectively 
evaluate the performance of an HBHA-based IGRA, combined with commercially 
available IGRAs, to assess their usefulness as a prognostic biomarkers and aid 
in the monitoring of TB treatment in children. Following clinical, 
microbiological, and radiological assessment, children younger than 18 years of 
age classified as either LTBI or active TB were tested at baseline and during 
treatment by the QuantiFERON TB-Plus (QFT) assay and an aliquot of whole-blood 
was stimulated with HBHA. Among the 655 children evaluated, 559 (85.3%) were 
classified as ""Non TB"", 44 patients (6.7%) with active TB, and 52 (7.9%) with 
LTBI. The median HBHA-IGRA IFN-gamma responses were able to discriminate active 
TB from LTBI (0.13 IU/ml vs 1.995, (p < 0,0001), those with asymptomatic TB from 
those with symptomatic TB (1.01 IU/ml vs 0.115 IU/ml, p 0.017), or more severe 
TB (p 0.022), and significantly raised during successful TB treatment 
(p < 0.0001). Conversely, CD4 + and CD8 + responses were similar in all groups 
of patients, although active TB patients had higher CD4 + responses and LTBI 
higher CD8 + responses.  Conclusion: HBHA-based IGRA, combined with CD4 + and 
CD8 + responses assessed by commercially available IGRAs, is a useful support in 
the characterization of the TB spectrum in children and monitoring of 
TB-therapy. What is Known: • Current immune diagnostics are not able to 
discriminate active and latent Ttuberculosis, including the recently approved 
QFT-PLUS.. • New immunological assays with prognostic value are highly needed. 
What is New: • HBHA-based IGRA, combined with CD4+ and CD8+ responses assessed 
by commercially available IGRAs, is a useful support for the differentiation of 
active and latent TB in children.. • HBHA-based IGRA, combined with CD4+ and

cardiogenic cerebral embolism (CCE). However, the underlying mechanism between 
cerebral embolism and NVAF is indefinite, and there is no effective and 
convenient biomarker to identify potential risk of CCE in patients with NVAF in 
clinic. The present study aims to identify risk factors for interpreting the 
potential association of CCE with NVAF and providing valuable biomarkers to 
predict the risk of CCE for NVAF patients.
METHODS: 641 NVAF patients diagnosed with CCE and 284 NVAF patients without any 
history of stroke were recruited in the present study. Clinical data including 
demographic characteristics, medical history, and clinical assessments, were 
recorded. Meanwhile, Blood cell counts, lipid profiles, high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein, and coagulation function-related indicators were measured. 
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was 
utilized to build a composite indicator model based on the blood risk factors.
RESULTS: (1) CCE patients had significantly increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and D-dimer levels as compared with 
patients in the NVAF group, and these three indicators can distinguish CCE 
patients from ones in the NVAF group with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 
over 0.750, respectively. (2) Using the LASSO model, a composite indicator, 
i.e., the risk score, was determined based on PLR and D-dimer and displayed 
differential power for distinguishing CCE patients from NVAF patients with an 
AUC value of over 0.934. (3) The risk score was positively correlated with the 
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and CHADS2 scores in CCE patients. 
(4) There was a significant association between the change value of the risk 
score and the recurrence time of stroke in initial CCE patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The PLR and D-dimer represent an aggravated process of inflammation 
and thrombosis in the occurrence of CCE after NVAF. The combination of these two 
risk factors can contribute to identifying the risk of CCE for patients with 
NVAF with an accuracy of 93.4%, and the greater in change of composite 
indicator, the shorter in the recurrence of CCE for NVAF patients.","Copyright © 2023 Shi, Xuan, Ji, Wang, Huang, Li, Wang, Deng, Shao, Chen, Mao,

suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a significant role in inflammatory diseases. But 
their correlation with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains 
unclear.
METHODS: The differentially expressed immune checkpoints and immunocytes in the 
airway tissues of COPD patients were identified by bioinformatics analysis, 
followed by correlation analysis and identification of immune-related 
differential genes for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene 
Ontology (GO) analysis. The results of bioinformatics analysis were verified by 
ELISA and Real-Time PCR and transcriptome sequencing of the peripheral blood of 
both COPD patients and healthy subjects.
RESULTS: The results of the bioinformatics analysis showed that the level of 
MDSCs in airway tissue and peripheral blood of COPD patients was higher than 
that of healthy controls. The expression of CSF1 in airway tissue and peripheral 
blood of COPD patients increased, and CYBB was increased in airway tissue and 
decreased in peripheral blood of COPD patients. The expression of HHLA2 in the 
airway tissue decreased in COPD patients, and showed a negative correlation with 
MDSCs, with a correlation coefficient of -0.37. The peripheral blood flow 
cytometry results indicated that MDSCs and Treg cells of COPD patients were 
higher than those in the healthy control group. The results of peripheral blood 
ELISA and RT-PCR showed that the HHLA2 and CSF1 levels in COPD patients were 
higher than those in the healthy control group.
CONCLUSION: In COPD, the bone marrow is stimulated to produce MDSCs, and a large 
number of MDSCs migrate to airway tissue through peripheral blood and cooperate 
with HHLA2 to exert an immunosuppressive effect. Whether MDSCs play an 
immunosuppressive effect during migration needs to be further confirmed.",© 2023 Xu et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/COPD.S394327

clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells. However, the effects of augmenting TCR 
signaling during chronic antigen exposure is less understood. Here, we 
investigated the role of diacylglycerol (DAG)-mediated signaling downstream of 
the TCR during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13 (LCMV CL13) 
infection by blocking DAG kinase zeta (DGKζ), a negative regulator of DAG.
METHODS: We examined the activation, survival, expansion, and phenotype of 
virus-specific T cell in the acute and chronic phases of LCMV CL13-infected in 
mice after DGKζ blockade or selective activation of ERK.
RESULTS: Upon LCMV CL13 infection, DGKζ deficiency promoted early short-lived 
effector cell (SLEC) differentiation of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells, but this was 
followed by abrupt cell death. Short-term inhibition of DGKζ with ASP1570, a 
DGKζ-selective pharmacological inhibitor, augmented CD8+ T cell activation 
without causing cell death, which reduced virus titers both in the acute and 
chronic phases of LCMV CL13 infection. Unexpectedly, the selective enhancement 
of ERK, one key signaling pathway downstream of DAG, lowered viral titers and 
promoted expansion, survival, and a memory phenotype of LCMV-specific CD8+ T 
cells in the acute phase with fewer exhausted T cells in the chronic phase. The 
difference seen between DGKζ deficiency and selective ERK enhancement could be 
potentially explained by the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway by DGKζ 
deficiency, since the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin rescued the abrupt cell death 
seen in virus-specific DGKζ KO CD8+ T cells.
DISCUSSION: Thus, while ERK is downstream of DAG signaling, the two pathways 
lead to distinct outcomes in the context of chronic CD8+ T cell activation, 
whereby DAG promotes SLEC differentiation and ERK promotes a memory phenotype.","Copyright © 2022 Harabuchi, Khan, Bassiri, Yoshida, Okada, Takizawa, Ikeda,

carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical problem. Metabolomics is prevalently involved 
in the identification of novel biomarkers. This study aims to identify new and 
effective markers for AFP negative HCC.
METHODS: In total, 147 patients undergoing liver transplantation were enrolled 
from our hospital, including liver cirrhosis patients (LC, n=25), AFP negative 
HCC patients (NEG, n=44) and HCC patients with AFP over 20 ng/mL (POS, n=78). 52 
Healthy volunteers (HC) were also recruited in this study. Metabolomic profiling 
was performed on the plasma of those patients and healthy volunteers to select 
candidate metabolomic biomarkers. A novel diagnostic model for AFP negative HCC 
was established based on Random forest analysis, and prognostic biomarkers were 
also identified.
RESULTS: 15 differential metabolites were identified being able to distinguish 
NEG group from both LC and HC group. Random forest analysis and subsequent 
Logistic regression analysis showed that PC(16:0/16:0), PC(18:2/18:2) and 
SM(d18:1/18:1) are independent risk factor for AFP negative HCC. A three-marker 
model of Metabolites-Score was established for the diagnosis of AFP negative HCC 
patients with an area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUROC) of 0.913, and a nomogram was then established as well. When the 
cut-off value of the score was set at 1.2895, the sensitivity and specificity 
for the model were 0.727 and 0.92, respectively. This model was also applicable 
to distinguish HCC from cirrhosis. Notably, the Metabolites-Score was not 
correlated to tumor or body nutrition parameters, but difference of the score 
was statistically significant between different neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) groups (≤5 vs. >5, P=0.012). Moreover, MG(18:2/0:0/0:0) was the only 
prognostic biomarker among 15 metabolites, which is significantly associated 
with tumor-free survival of AFP negative HCC patients (HR=1.160, 95%CI 
1.012-1.330, P=0.033).
CONCLUSION: The established three-marker model and nomogram based on metabolomic 
profiling can be potential non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of AFP negative 
HCC. The level of MG(18:2/0:0/0:0) exhibits good prognosis prediction 
performance for AFP negative HCC.","Copyright © 2023 Lin, Li, He, Yang, Chen, Yang, Zhuo, Shen, Hu, Pan, Wei, Lu,

we investigated whether Smad7-expressing CD4+ T cells and the methylation of 
Smad7 gene in CD4+ T cells contribute to the disease activity of RA in patients.
METHODS: Peripheral CD4+ T cells were collected from 35 healthy controls and 57 
RA patients. Smad7 expression by CD4+ T cells were determined and correlated 
with the clinical parameters of RA including RA score and serum levels of IL-6, 
CRP, ESR, DAS28-CRP, DAS28-ESR, Swollen joints and Tender joints. Bisulfite 
sequencing (BSP-seq) was used to determine the DNA methylation in Smad7 promoter 
(-1000 to +2000) region in CD4+ T cells. In addition, a DNA methylation 
inhibitor, 5-Azacytidine (5-AzaC), was added to CD4+ T cells to examine the 
possible role of Smad7 methylation in CD4+ T cell differentiation and functional 
activity.
RESULTS: Compared to the heath controls, Smad7 expression was significantly 
decreased in CD4+ T cells from RA patients and inversely correlated with the RA 
activity score and serum levels of IL-6 and CRP. Importantly, loss of Smad7 in 
CD4+ T cell was associated with the alteration of Th17/Treg balance by 
increasing Th17 over the Treg population. BSP-seq detected that DNA 
hypermethylation occurred in the Smad7 promoter region of CD4+ T cells obtained 
from RA patients. Mechanistically, we found that the DNA hypermethylation in the 
Smad7 promoter of CD4+ T cells was associated with decreased Smad7 expression in 
RA patients. This was associated with overreactive DNA methyltransferase (DMNT1) 
and downregulation of the methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBD4). Inhibition 
of DNA methylation by treating CD4+ T cells from RA patients with 5-AzaC 
significantly increased Smad7 mRNA expression along with the increased MBD4 but 
reduced DNMT1 expression, which was associated with the rebalance in the 
Th17/Treg response.
CONCLUSION: DNA hypermethylation at the Smad7 promoter regions may cause a loss 
of Smad7 in CD4+ T cells of RA patients, which may contribute to the RA activity 
by disrupting the Th17/Treg balance.","Copyright © 2023 Hu, Xu, He, Shan, Zhou, Wang, Bai, Shang, Nie, Pan, Lan and

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still one of the most common causes of 
cancer-related deaths. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a 
critical factor in the oncogenesis and progression of HCC. The emerging 
scRNA-seq makes it possible to explore the TME at a high resolution. This study 
was designed to reveal the immune-metabolic crosstalk between immune cells in 
HCC and provide novel strategies to regulate immunosuppressive TME.
METHOD: In this study, we performed scRNA-seq on paired tumor and peri-tumor 
tissues of HCC. The composition and differentiation trajectory of the immune 
populations in TME were portrayed. Cellphone DB was utilized to calculate 
interactions between the identified clusters. Besides, flow cytometry, RT-PCR 
and seahorse experiments were implemented to explore potential metabolic and 
epigenetic mechanisms of the inter-cellular interaction.
RESULT: A total of 19 immune cell clusters were identified and 7 were found 
closely related to HCC prognosis. Besides, differentiation trajectories of T 
cells were also presented. Moreover, a new population, CD3+C1q+ tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAM) were identified and found significantly interacted with CD8+ 
CCL4+T cells. Compared to the peri-tumor tissue, their interaction was 
attenuated in tumor. Additionally, the dynamic presence of this newly found 
cluster was also verified in the peripheral blood of patients with sepsis. 
Furthermore, we found that CD3+C1q+TAM affected T cell immunity through C1q 
signaling-induced metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming, thereby potentially 
affecting tumor prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the interaction between CD3+C1q+TAM and CD8+ 
CCL4+T cells and may provide implications for tackling the immunosuppressive TME 
in HCC.","Copyright © 2023 Yang, Sun, Chen, Liu, Xu, Liu, Ma, Chen, Lu, Fang, Chen, Shi

driving clonal expansion of B cells expressing B cell receptors (BCRs), often 
encoded by the VH1-69 variable gene, endowed with both rheumatoid factor (RF) 
and anti-HCV specificity. These cells display an atypical CD21low phenotype and 
functional exhaustion evidenced by unresponsiveness to BCR and Toll-like 
receptor 9 (TLR9) stimuli. Although antiviral therapy is effective on MC 
vasculitis, pathogenic B cell clones persist long thereafter and can cause 
virus-independent disease relapses.
METHODS: Clonal B cells from patients with HCV-associated type 2 MC or healthy 
donors were stimulated with CpG or heath-aggregated IgG (as surrogate immune 
complexes) alone or in combination; proliferation and differentiation were then 
evaluated by flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of AKT and of the p65 NF-kB subunit 
were measured by flow cytometry. TLR9 was quantified by qPCR and by 
intracellular flow cytometry, and MyD88 isoforms were analyzed using RT-PCR.
DISCUSSION: We found that dual triggering with autoantigen and CpG restored the 
capacity of exhausted VH1-69pos B cells to proliferate. The signaling mechanism 
for this BCR/TLR9 crosstalk remains elusive, since TLR9 mRNA and protein as well 
as MyD88 mRNA were normally expressed and CpG-induced phosphorylation of p65 
NF-kB was intact in MC clonal B cells, whereas BCR-induced p65 NF-kB 
phosphorylation was impaired and PI3K/Akt signaling was intact. Our findings 
indicate that autoantigen and CpG of microbial or cellular origin may unite to 
foster persistence of pathogenic RF B cells in HCV-cured MC patients. BCR/TLR9 
crosstalk might represent a more general mechanism enhancing systemic 
autoimmunity by the rescue of exhausted autoreactive CD21low B cells.","Copyright © 2023 Del Padre, Marrapodi, Minafò, Piano Mortari, Radicchio, Bocci,

and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) immune escape is 
regulated by the exhaustion of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, which is associated 
with abnormal expression of negative regulatory molecule CD244. However, the 
underlying mechanisms are unclear. To investigate the important roles of 
non-coding RNAs play in CD244 regulating HBV immune escape, we performed 
microarray analysis to determine the differential expression profiles of long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs in patients with CHB 
and patients with spontaneous clearance of HBV. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
was analyzed by bioinformatics methods and confirmed by the dual-luciferase 
reporter assay. Furthermore, gene silencing and overexpression experiments were 
used to further identify the roles of lncRNA and miRNA in HBV immune escape 
through CD244 regulation. The results showed that the expression of CD244 on the 
surface of CD8+ T cells was significantly increased in CHB patients and in the 
co-culture system of T cells and HBV-infected HepAD38 cells, which was 
accompanied by the reduction of miR-330-3p and the elevation of lnc-AIFM2-1. The 
down-regulated miR-330-3p induced the apoptosis of T cells by lifting the 
inhibition of CD244, which was reversed by miR-330-3p mimic or CD244-siRNA. 
Lnc-AIFM2-1 promotes the accumulation of CD244, which is mediated by decreased 
miR-330-3p, and then reduced the clearance ability of CD8+ T cells to HBV 
through regulated CD244 expression. And the injury in the ability of CD8+ T 
cells to clear HBV can be reversed by lnc-AIFM2-1-siRNA, miR-330-3p mimic, or 
CD244-siRNA. Collectively, our findings indicate that lnc-AIFM2-1 on CD244 by 
acting as a ceRNA of miR-330-3p contributes to HBV immune escape, which may 
provide novel insights into the roles of interaction networks among lncRNA, 
miRNA, and mRNA in HBV immune escape, highlighting potential applications of 
lnc-AIFM2-1 and CD244 for diagnosis and treatment in CHB.","Copyright © 2023 Xie, Wang, Zhang, Zhu, Jiang, Shi, Si and Chen.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1121795

released into extracellular spaces as extracellular ATP (eATP) as a consequence 
of cell injury or death and activates the purinergic receptors. Once released, 
eATP may facilitate T-lymphocyte activation and differentiation. The purpose of 
this review is to elucidate the role of ATP-mediated signaling in the 
immunological events related to type 1 diabetes (T1D).
RECENT FINDINGS: T lymphocytes mediate immune response during the onset of T1D 
and promote pancreatic islet or whole pancreas rejection in transplantation. 
Recent data suggest a potential role for eATP in early steps of T1D onset and of 
allograft rejection. In different preclinical experimental models and clinical 
trials, several drugs targeting purinergic signaling have been employed to 
abrogate lymphocyte activation and differentiation, thus representing an 
achievable treatment to prevent/revert T1D or to induce long-term islet 
allograft function.
SUMMARY: In preclinical and clinical settings, eATP-signaling inhibition induces 
immune tolerance in autoimmune disease and in allotransplantation. In this view, 
the purinergic system may represent a novel therapeutic target for auto- and 
allo-immunity.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.phrs.2023.106709

acid conjugate (4), was found to exhibit strong immunosuppressive activity. 
Various methods were used to evaluate the immunosuppressive activity and 
mechanism of action of the compound to explore its potential applications.
METHODS: T cell proliferation, mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), and Th1/Th17 
differentiation assays were used to evaluate the immunosuppressive activity of 
the compound. Differentially expressed genes from RNA sequencing were analysed 
with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, 
while enriched signalling pathways were further validated by western blotting 
(WB). In vivo efficacy was validated with delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) 
mouse models and dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) mouse model.
RESULTS: Compound 4 inhibited concanavalin A -induced mouse splenic T cell 
proliferation (IC50 = 15 nM) and anti-CD3/CD28-induced human primary T cell 
proliferation (IC50 = 30 nM) while also reducing the secretion of hIFN-γ. 
Compound 4 exhibited similar inhibitory activity in MLR assay. Compound 4 
dose-dependently inhibited human Th1/Th17 differentiation. The KEGG pathway 
enrichment analysis indicated that the genes related to T cell activation 
signalling pathways PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and NF-κB were significantly enriched. WB 
confirmed that compound 4 inhibited the AKT/MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways. 
Compound 4 dose-dependently inhibited ear and foot pad swelling in DTH mouse 
models. In the DSS-induced IBD mouse model, compound 4 significantly decreased 
the disease activity index and colon density, and inhibited splenomegaly of the 
mice.
CONCLUSION: The in vitro and in vivo results indicated that compound 4 has the 
potential to be developed into an anti-IBD drug.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.109918

early in life as a result of arrested granulopoiesis. Multiple genetic defects 
are known to block granulocyte differentiation; however, a genetic cause remains 
unknown in approximately 40% of cases.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize a patient with severe congenital neutropenia 
and syndromic features without a genetic diagnosis.
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing results were validated using flow cytometry, 
Western blotting, coimmunoprecipitation, quantitative PCR, cell cycle and 
proliferation analysis of lymphocytes and fibroblasts and granulocytic 
differentiation of primary CD34+ and HL-60 cells.
RESULTS: We identified a homozygous missense mutation in DBF4 in a patient with 
mild extra-uterine growth retardation, facial dysmorphism and severe congenital 
neutropenia. DBF4 is the regulatory subunit of the CDC7 kinase, together known 
as DBF4-dependent kinase (DDK), the complex essential for DNA replication 
initiation. The DBF4 variant demonstrated impaired ability to bind CDC7, 
resulting in decreased DDK-mediated phosphorylation, defective S-phase entry and 
progression and impaired differentiation of granulocytes associated with 
activation of the p53-p21 pathway. The introduction of wild-type DBF4 into 
patient CD34+ cells rescued the promyelocyte differentiation arrest.

treatment of several types of cancers, including metastatic differentiated 
thyroid cancer (DTC). The intended targets include VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-4, PDGFRα, 
RET, and KIT signaling pathways, but drug resistance inevitably develops and a 
complete cure is very rare. Recent data has revealed that most of the TKIs have 
additional 'off-target' immunological effects, which might contribute to a 
protective antitumor immune response; however, human cellular data are lacking 
regarding Lenvatinib-mediated immunomodulation in DTC. Here, we investigated in 
ex vivo models the impact of Lenvatinib on the function of immune cells in 
healthy volunteers. We found that monocytes and macrophages were particularly 
susceptible to Lenvatinib, while neutrophiles and lymphocytes were less 
affected. In tumor-immune cell co-culture experiments, Lenvatinib exerted a 
broad inhibitory effect on the proinflammatory response in TC-induced 
macrophages. Interestingly, Lenvatinib-treated cells had decreased cellular M2 
membrane markers, whereas they secreted a significantly higher level of the 
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 upon LPS stimulation. In addition, prolonged 
exposure to Lenvatinib impaired macrophages survival and phenotypical 
differentiation, which was accompanied by remarkable morphological changes and 
suppressed cellular metabolic activity. These effects were mediated by myeloid 
cell-intrinsic mechanisms which are independent of Lenvatinib's on-target 
activity. Finally, using specific inhibitors, we argue that dual effects on p38 
MAPK and Syk pathways are likely the underlying mechanism of the off-target 
immunological effects we observed in this study. Collectively, our data show the 
immunomodulatory properties of Lenvatinib on human monocytes. These insights 
could be harnessed for the future design of novel treatment strategies involving 
a combination of Lenvatinib with other immunotherapeutic agents.","DOI: 10.3390/pharmaceutics15020412

CD39/CD73 pathway hydrolyzes ATP into adenosine, which has a potent 
immunosuppressive effect. CD39 regulates the function of a variety of 
immunologic cells through the purinergic signaling pathways. CD39+ T cells have 
been implicated in viral infections, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
(HIV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), viral hepatitis, and Corona Virus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) infections. The expression of CD39 is an indicator of lymphocyte 
exhaustion, which develops during chronicity. During RNA viral infections, the 
CD39 marker can profile the populations of CD4+ T lymphocytes into two 
populations, T-effector lymphocytes, and T-regulatory lymphocytes, where CD39 is 
predominantly expressed on the T-regulatory cells. The level of CD39 in T 
lymphocytes can predict the disease progression, antiviral immune responses, and 
the response to antiviral drugs. Besides, the percentage of CD39 and CD73 in B

self-reported milk intolerance (SRMI) patients who test negative and/or are 
asymptomatic at Lactose Hydrogen Breath Test (LHBT). We analyzed fecal 
calprotectin (FCP) values in SRMI patients to investigate the frequency of a 
""positive"" intestinal inflammation marker and its correlation with lactose 
tolerance/intolerance. Data from 329 SRMI patients were retrospectively 
analyzed; according to the positive/negative results (maldigester/digester) and 
the presence/absence of symptoms reported during LHBT (intolerant/tolerant), 
patients were divided into: 'lactose tolerants' (n. 104), 
'maldigesters/intolerants' (n. 187), 'digesters/intolerants' (n. 38). FCP values 
were analyzed in all three subgroups. A percentage of SRMI patients complained 
of constipation (>15%), extraintestinal symptoms (>30% including anemia), 
multiple food hypersensitivity (7.6%) and had intraepithelial lymphocytic 
infiltration at duodenal biopsy (>50%). Over 50.0% showed FCP values above the 
normal limit. Lactose tolerants and maldigesters/intolerants had higher 
positivity frequencies (p < 0.0001, for both) and absolute values (p = 0.04, for 
maldigesters/intolerants) of FCP compared to digesters/intolerants. FCP was not 
useful to differentiate tolerant from intolerant subjects (AUC 0.58). Our data 
suggest the existence of an allergic/inflammatory pathogenetic mechanism in a 
subset of SRMI subjects. FCP results are in keeping with this hypothesis, even 
if they cannot differentiate lactose tolerant from intolerant patients.","DOI: 10.3390/nu15041048

fate: to become either short-lived effector cells (SLECs) or memory progenitor 
effector cells (MPECs). SLECs are specialized in providing an immediate effector 
function but have a shorter lifespan and lower proliferative capacity compared 
to MPECs. Upon encountering the cognate antigen during an infection, CD8 T cells 
rapidly expand and then contract to a level that is maintained for the memory 
phase after the peak of the response. Studies have shown that the contraction 
phase is mediated by TGFβ and selectively targets SLECs, while sparing MPECs. 
The aim of this study is to investigate how the CD8 T cell precursor stage 
determines TGFβ sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that MPECs and SLECs have 
differential responses to TGFβ, with SLECs being more sensitive to TGFβ than 
MPECs. This difference in sensitivity is associated with the levels of TGFβRI 
and RGS3, and the SLEC-related transcriptional activator T-bet binding to the 
TGFβRI promoter may provide a molecular basis for increased TGFβ sensitivity in 
SLECs.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24043930

Most patients (85%) develop B-cell ALL; however, T-cell ALL tends to be more 
aggressive. We have previously identified 2B4 (SLAMF4), CS1 (SLAMF7) and LLT1 
(CLEC2D) that can activate or inhibit NK cells upon the interaction with their 
ligands. In this study, the expression of 2B4, CS1, LLT1, NKp30 and NKp46 was 
determined. The expression profiles of these immune receptors were analyzed in 
the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of B-ALL and T-ALL subjects by 
single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from the St. Jude PeCan data portal 
that showed increased expression of LLT1 in B-ALL and T-ALL subjects. Whole 
blood was collected from 42 pediatric ALL subjects at diagnosis and 
post-induction chemotherapy and 20 healthy subjects, and expression was 
determined at the mRNA and cell surface protein level. A significant increase in 
cell surface LLT1 expression in T cells, monocytes and NK cells was observed. 
Increased expression of CS1 and NKp46 was observed on monocytes of ALL subjects 
at diagnosis. A decrease of LLT1, 2B4, CS1 and NKp46 on T cells of ALL subjects 
was also observed post-induction chemotherapy. Furthermore, mRNA data showed 
altered expression of receptors in ALL subjects pre- and post-induction 
chemotherapy treatment. The results indicate that the differential expression of 
the receptors/ligand may play a role in the T-cell- and NK-cell-mediated immune 
surveillance of pediatric ALL.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24043860

spermatogenesis and protecting the developing germ cells from detrimental immune 
responses which could affect fertility. Though these immune responses consist of 
many immune processes, this review focuses on the understudied complement 
system. Complement consists of 50+ proteins including regulatory proteins, 
immune receptors, and a cascade of proteolytic cleavages resulting in target 
cell destruction. In the testis, Sertoli cells protect the germ cells from 
autoimmune destruction by creating an immunoregulatory environment. Most studies 
on Sertoli cells and complement have been conducted in transplantation models, 
which are effective in studying immune regulation during robust rejection 
responses. In grafts, Sertoli cells survive activated complement, have decreased 
deposition of complement fragments, and express many complement inhibitors. 
Moreover, the grafts have delayed infiltration of immune cells and contain 
increased infiltration of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells as compared to 
rejecting grafts. Additionally, anti-sperm antibodies and lymphocyte 
infiltration have been detected in up to 50% and 30% of infertile testes, 
respectively. This review seeks to provide an updated overview of the complement 
system, describe its relationship with immune cells, and explain how Sertoli 
cells may regulate complement in immunoprotection. Identifying the mechanism 
Sertoli cells use to protect themselves and germ cells against complement and 
immune destruction is relevant for male reproduction, autoimmunity, and 
transplantation.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24043371

countries. However, CLL is relatively rare in Asia; its genetic features are 
rarely studied. Here, we aimed to genetically characterize Korean CLL patients 
and to elucidate the genetic and clinical associations based on data obtained 
from 113 patients at a single Korean institute. We used next-generation 
sequencing to explore the multi-gene mutational data and immunoglobulin heavy 
chain variable gene clonality with somatic hypermutation (SHM). MYD88 (28.3%), 
including L265P (11.5%) and V217F (13.3%), was the most frequently mutated gene, 
followed by KMT2D (6.2%), NOTCH1 (5.3%), SF3B1 (5.3%), and TP53 (4.4%). 
MYD88-mutated CLL was characterized by SHM and atypical immunophenotype with 
fewer cytogenetic abnormalities. The 5-year time to treatment (TTT) of the 
overall cohort was 49.8% ± 8.2% (mean ± standard deviation) and the 5-year 
overall survival was 86.2% ± 5.8%. Patients with SHM, isolated del(13q), 
TP53-wild type, and NOTCH1-wild type showed better results than those without 
these conditions. In the subgroup analyses, patients with SHM and L265P 
presented shorter TTT than patients with SHM but not L265P. In contrast, V217F 
was associated with a higher SHM percentage and showed a favorable prognosis.

treatment in patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive papillary urothelial 
carcinoma (NMIPUC), the most common type of bladder cancer. The therapy outcomes 
are variable and may depend on the immune response within the tumor 
microenvironment. In our study, we explored the prognostic value of CD8+ cell 
density gradient indicators across the tumor epithelium-stroma interface of 
NMIPUC.
METHODS: Clinical and pathologic data were retrospectively collected from 157 
NMIPUC patients treated with BCG immunotherapy after transurethral resection. 
Whole-slide digital image analysis of CD8 immunohistochemistry slides was used 
for tissue segmentation, CD8+ cell quantification, and the assessment of CD8+ 
cell densities within the epithelium-stroma interface. Subsequently, the 
gradient indicators (center of mass and immunodrop) were computed to represent 
the density gradient across the interface.
RESULTS: By univariable analysis of the clinicopathologic factors, including the 
history of previous NMIPUC, poor tumor differentiation, and pT1 stage, were 
associated with shorter RFS (p < 0.05). In CD8+ analyses, only the gradient 
indicators but not the absolute CD8+ densities were predictive for RFS (p < 
0.05). The best-performing cross-validated model included previous episodes of 
NMIPUC (HR = 4.4492, p = 0.0063), poor differentiation (HR = 2.3672, p = 
0.0457), and immunodrop (HR = 5.5072, p = 0.0455).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that gradient indicators of CD8+ cell densities across the 
tumor epithelium-stroma interface, along with routine clinical and pathology 
data, improve the prediction of RFS in NMIPUC.","DOI: 10.3390/cancers15041205

most specific immune responses, is also modulated by miRNAs. The generation and 
maturation of various T-cell subsets concomitant with B-cells is under precise

hematopoietic stem cells, which further differentiate into various T-cell 
subsets under strict regulation of miRNAs and transcription factors. 
Subsequently, the differentiation of B-cells from common lymphocyte progenitors

but understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for these properties is 
still far from complete. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a product of the 
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway, is indicated as one of the key mediators in 
the immunomodulatory effect of MSCs. Due to the pleiotropic effect of this 
molecule, determining its role in particular intercellular interactions and 
aspects of cell functioning is very difficult. In this article, the authors 
attempt to summarize the previous observations regarding the role of PGE2 and 
COX-2 in the immunomodulatory properties and other vital functions of MSCs. So 
far, the most consistent results relate to the inhibitory effect of MSC-derived 
PGE2 on the early maturation of dendritic cells, suppressive effect on the 
proliferation of activated lymphocytes, and stimulatory effect on the 
differentiation of macrophages into M2 phenotype. Additionally, COX-2/PGE2 plays 
an important role in maintaining the basic life functions of MSCs, such as the 
ability to proliferate, migrate and differentiate, and it also positively 
affects the formation of niches that are conducive to both hematopoiesis and 
carcinogenesis.","DOI: 10.3390/biomedicines11020445

(#)Contributed equally","The central role of the microbiota as a pivotal factor regulating anti-tumor 
immune responses has recently been appreciated. Increasing evidence has put a 
spotlight on the connection of microbiota to T cells, by showing impaired 
effector and/or memory responses in germ-free (GF) mice or in the presence of 
dysbiotic communities, and association with tumor growth and overall survival 
(OS). These observations also have significant implications for anti-tumor 
therapy and vaccination, suggesting that the communication between T cells and 
the microbiota involves soluble mediators (microbiota-derived metabolites) that 
influence various functions of T cells. In addition, there is growing 
appreciation of the role of bacterial translocation into the peritumoral milieu 
from the intestinal tract, as well as of locally developed tumor microbial 
communities, spatially separated from the gut microbiota, in shaping the tumor 
microbiome. Collectively, these findings have added new support to the idea that 
tonic inputs mirroring the existence of tumor microbiome could regulate the 
function of tumor-infiltrating T cells and tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells. 
In this review, we focus on recent advances and aspects of these active areas of 
investigation and provide a comprehensive overview of the unique mechanisms that 
play a pivotal role in the regulation of anti-tumor immunity by the microbiota, 
some of which could be of particular relevance for addressing problems caused by 
tumor heterogeneity. It is our hope that this review will provide a theoretical 
foundation for future investigations in this area.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41419-023-05560-2

but the underlying mediators and mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we 
used flow cytometry to investigate the alterations in immune cell subsets in 
adenomyotic uteri and analyze the phenotype and function of abnormal immune 
cells. We found that an increase in cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T-cell 
number was the predominant alteration in ectopic lesions in patients with 
adenomyosis and was significantly associated with the severity of adenomyosis. 
Importantly, we identified an exhausted natural killer group protein 2A 
(NKG2A)+CD8+ T-cell subset that was associated with the severity of adenomyosis 
and found that the number of these cells was significantly increased in the 
eutopic endometrium and ectopic lesions. In addition, the increases in the 
expression of NKG2A ligand histocompatibility leucocyte antigen E and 
interleukin-15 in glandular epithelial cells in the adenomyotic microenvironment 
might contribute to CD8+ T-cell exhaustion by promoting NKG2A expression on CD8+ 
T cells or inhibiting the effector function of these cells. In conclusion, our 
data revealed a previously unrecognized role for NKG2A+CD8+ T-cell exhaustion in 
the pathogenesis of adenomyosis, indicating that therapeutic interventions 
designed to target and reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells may be beneficial for 
patients with adenomyosis.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.mucimm.2023.02.003

of non-relapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (allo-HSCT). CD4+ follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, specialized 
providers of T cell help to B cells, play a vital role in GVHD pathogenesis. 
B-cell lymphoma-6 (Bcl-6) transcription factor has been shown to be required for 
Tfh-mediated germinal center reactions. In this study, we would like to evaluate 
the effect of Bcl-6 on Tfh function in sclerodermatous cGVHD and the efficacy of 
Bcl-6 inhibitors (Bcl-6i) for treating a minor histocompatibility complex (miHC) 
mismatch model of sclerodermatous cGVHD (scl-cGVHD).
METHODS: A minor histocompatibility haploidentical model of scl-cGVHD was 
established and received intraperitoneal injection of 79-6, a small-molecule 
inhibitor of Bcl-6. The clinical manifestations and survival times of cGVHD mice 
were recorded. The histological assessment was performed by hematoxylin-eosin 
(HE) and Masson's trichrome staining on the skin and lung tissues. Tfh cells and 
germinal center B cells in the spleen and peripheral blood were detected by flow 
cytometry. The cellular markers were immunostained in different organs. ELISA 
was performed to detect cytokine secretion.
RESULTS: Bcl-6 inhibition by 79-6 improved the clinical manifestation of 
scl-cGVHD mice and prolonged their survival. The histopathologic damage, 
particular the fibrotic changes of scl-cGVHD mice was significantly relieved 
after 79-6 treatment. Furthermore, 79-6 treatment not only suppressed the 
development and function of Tfh and Tph cells in the peripheral blood, but also 
reduced the survival of Tfh cells in the spleen. Moreover, 79-6 decreased the 
frequency of GC plasmocytes accompanied by a reduction in IL-21.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that Bcl-6 inhibitor could prevent murine 
sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease by abrogating T follicular 
helper differentiation and suppressing the function of GC B cells, indicating 
that Bcl-6 inhibition may be a potential treatment for patients with cGVHD.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.109746

sclerosis (MS) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunoglobulin-G 
(MOG-IgG) associated disease (MOGAD) and the difficulty in distinguishing 
between the two diseases. Here, we measured and compared the readily available 
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) to determine whether these three biomarkers 
can help to distinguish MOGAD and MS at disease onset. The impact of these three 
biomarkers on MOGAD and MS relapse also needs to be explored.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we obtained clinical and paraclinical 
data from the first attacks of MOGAD (N = 31) and MS (N = 50). Electronic 
medical records were used to collect demographic data (gender, age at onset), 
clinical symptoms, EDSS at onset, and medical treatments. The primary outcome 
was relapse within one year of onset. Four hematological parameters were 
recorded, including neutrophil count, platelet count, lymphocyte count, and 
monocyte count. NLR, PLR, and MLR were calculated and compared between MOGAD, 
MS, and HC. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the 
ability of NLR, PLR, and MLR to distinguish between MOGAD and MS, MOGAD and HC, 
respectively. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the 
impact of NLR/PLR/MLR on MOGAD/MS relapse within one year of onset.
RESULTS: Compared to HC, NLR is significantly higher in MOGAD and MS (p<0.001, 
p = 0.04, respectively). The PLR and MLR are elevated in MOGAD compared to HC 
(p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively), and MLR in MS are also statistically higher 
than in HC (p = 0.023). It is worth noting that NLR and PLR were much higher in 
MOGAD compared to MS (p<0.001, p = 0.001, respectively), but a significant 
difference regarding MLR has not been found between MOGAD and MS. Based on ROC 
curve analyses, we found that using NLR, PLR, and MLR to discriminate between 
MOGAD and MS yielded a ROC-plot area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.794, 
0.727, and 0.681, respectively. Meanwhile, the AUC of NLR, PLR, and MLR to 
discriminate between MOGAD and HC were 0.926, 0.772, and 0.786. Furthermore, the 
logistics analysis revealed a significant positive association between PLR and 
MOGAD relapse.
CONCLUSION: NLR helps differentiate MOGAD and MS in disease onset, and higher 
PLR was related to MOGAD relapse.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.msard.2023.104570

University, Qingdao, Shandong Province, China.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is 
considered standard treatment for early gastric cancer (EGC), patients with 
non-curative resection (NCR) of ESD may still require gastrectomy. The systemic 
immune-inflammation index (SII) showed great potential in predicting the 
prognosis of gastric cancer patients. This study aims to investigate the 
predictive validity of SII of NCR in EGC patients.
METHODS: We reviewed data from EGC patients who underwent ESD in the past. The 
relationship between SII and clinicopathologic features was investigated. We 
used Receiver operating characteristic curves to compare the predictive values 
of NCR between SII and other inflammation indices. Binary logistic analysis was 
used to identify independent risk factors for NCR. These factors were then used 
to construct a predictive nomogram.
RESULTS: SII was associated with larger tumor size, male gender, older age, 
submucosal invasion, and a greater risk of NCR. SII showed better predictivity 
of NCR than platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR). SII [odds ratio (OR) = 1.003, P = 0.001], NLR (OR = 1.520, 
P = 0.029), PLR (OR = 1.009, P = 0.010), upper stomach tumors (OR = 16.393, 
P < 0.001), poorly differentiated type (OR = 29.754, P < 0.001), ulceration 
(OR = 4.814, P = 0.001), and submucosal invasion (OR = 48.91, P < 0.001) were 
independent risk factors for NCR. The nomogram model based on these factors 
exhibited superior concordance and accuracy.
CONCLUSION: SII could be considered a simple and effective predictor of NCR of 
ESD in EGC patients.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MEG.0000000000002528

microorganisms early in life. Gammaherpesviruses (γHVs), such as Epstein-Barr 
virus, are widespread human viruses that establish lifelong infection and 
profoundly shape host immunity. Using murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4), a mouse γHV, 
we show that after infection, lung-resident and recruited group 2 innate 
lymphoid cells (ILC2s) exhibit a reduced ability to expand and produce type 2 
cytokines in response to house dust mites, thereby contributing to protection 
against asthma. In contrast, MuHV-4 infection triggers GM-CSF production by 
those lung ILC2s, which orders the differentiation of monocytes (Mos) into 
alveolar macrophages (AMs) without promoting their type 2 functions. In the 
context of γHV infection, ILC2s are therefore essential cells within the 
pulmonary niche that imprint the tissue-specific identity of Mo-derived AMs and 
shape their function well beyond the initial acute infection.","DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.abl9041

during immune responses, ranging from initial viral control through the 
production of type I interferons to antigen presentation. However, recent 
studies uncovered unexpected heterogeneity among pDCs. We identified a 
previously uncharacterized immune subset, referred to as pDC-like cells, that 
not only resembles pDCs but also shares conventional DC (cDC) features. We show 
that this subset is a circulating precursor distinct from common DC progenitors, 
with prominent cDC2 potential. Our findings from human CD2-iCre and CD300c-iCre 
lineage tracing mouse models suggest that a substantial fraction of cDC2s 
originates from pDC-like cells, which can therefore be referred to as pre-DC2. 
This precursor subset responds to homeostatic cytokines, such as macrophage 
colony stimulating factor, by expanding and differentiating into cDC2 that 
efficiently prime T helper 17 (TH17) cells. Development of pre-DC2 into CX3CR1+ 
ESAM- cDC2b but not CX3CR1- ESAM+ cDC2a requires the transcription factor KLF4. 
Last, we show that, under homeostatic conditions, this developmental pathway 
regulates the immune threshold at barrier sites by controlling the pool of TH17

response of immune cells. For example, it was shown that a Ca2+ concentration of 
at least 1.5 mM during in vitro stimulation is needed for optimal cytokine 
production by conventional αβ T cells. Here we extend these findings by showing 
that also unconventional T cells (invariant Natural Killer T cells, 
mucosal-associated invariant T cells, γδ T cells), as well as B cells, show an 
increased cytokine response following in vitro stimulation in the presence of 
elevated Ca2+ concentrations. This effect appeared more pronounced with mouse 
than with human lymphoid cells and did not influence their survival. A similarly 
increased cytokine response due to elevated Ca2+ levels was observed with 
primary human monocytes. In contrast, primary human monocyte-derived 
macrophages, either unpolarized (M0) or polarized into M1 or M2 macrophages, 
displayed increased cell death in the presence of elevated Ca2+ concentrations. 
Furthermore, elevated Ca2+ concentrations promoted phenotypic M1 differentiation 
by increasing M1 markers on M1 and M2 macrophages and decreasing M2 markers on 
M2 macrophages. However, the cytokine production of macrophages, again in 
contrast to the lymphoid cells, was unaltered by the Ca2+ concentration. In 
summary, our data demonstrate that the Ca2+ concentration during in vitro 
cultures is an important variable to be considered for functional experiments 
and that elevated Ca2+ levels can boost cytokine production by both mouse and 
human lymphoid cells.","Copyright: © 2023 Eskiocak et al. This is an open access article distributed

that mainly affects the aorta and its major branches. While recent studies have 
identified proinflammatory T cells, including Th1 and Th17 cells, as the 
dominant infiltrates in the arterial adventitia, mechanisms underpinning the 
maintenance of such vasculogenic T cells remain obscure.
METHODS: 75 patients with TAK and 30 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled 
in this study. CD4 T cells from TAK patients were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 
beads to mimic vasculogenic T cells. The survival of T cells was detected by 
quantifying Annexin-V+7-AAD+ fractions. Expression and activity of AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) were determined using phosflow cytometry and immunoblots. 
Specific inhibitors and shRNA were applied to block the function of AMPK and 
Notch1, while erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) 
were used to reflect the disease activity of TAK patients.
RESULTS: T cells from TAK patients undergo spontaneous differentiation into 
vasculogenic proinflammatory T cells with prolonged survival capacity. 
Mechanistic explorations uncover AMPK hyperactivity in such T cells from TAK 
patients, promoting mitochondrial metabolism and their survival. Such AMPK 
hyperactivity results from the robust Notch1 activity in TAK T cells. 
Accordingly, T cell-intrinsic phosphor-AMPK reflects the disease activity in 
clinical TAK patients.
CONCLUSIONS: AMPK hyperactivity is essential for maintaining the vasculogenic 
proinflammatory T cells in TAK patients, serving as a promising therapeutic 
target for TAK management.","DOI: 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/th1an2

therapies for those who have been exposed to the respirable particle. We 
explored the mechanisms of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model 
using multiple modalities including wholelung single-nucleus RNA sequencing. 
These analyses revealed that in addition to pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, 
intratracheal silica challenge induced osteoclast-like differentiation of 
alveolar macrophages and recruited monocytes, driven by induction of the 
osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand 
(RANKL) in pulmonary lymphocytes and alveolar type II cells. Furthermore, 
anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody treatment suppressed silica-induced 
osteoclast-like differentiation in the lung and attenuated silica-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis. We conclude that silica induces osteoclast-like 
differentiation of distinct recruited and tissue resident monocyte populations, 
leading to progressive lung injury, likely due to sustained elaboration of bone 
resorbing proteases and hydrochloric acid. Interrupting osteoclast-like 
differentiation may therefore constitute a promising avenue for moderating lung 
damage in silicosis.

    Elife. 2023 Apr 11;12:","The activation of Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) by S1P promotes 
lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs, a process critical for immune 
surveillance and T cell effector activity 1-4 . Multiple drugs that inhibit 
S1PR1 function are in use clinically for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. 
Cluster of Differentiation 69 (CD69) is an endogenous negative regulator of 
lymphocyte egress that interacts with S1PR1 in cis to facilitate internalization 
and degradation of the receptor 5,6 . The mechanism by which CD69 causes S1PR1 
internalization has been unclear. Moreover, although there are numerous class A 
GPCR structures determined with different small molecule agonists bound, it 
remains unknown whether a transmembrane protein per se can act as a class A GPCR 
agonist. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of CD69-bound S1PR1 coupled to 
the heterotrimeric G i complex. The transmembrane helix (TM) of one protomer of 
CD69 homodimer contacts the S1PR1-TM4. This interaction allosterically induces 
the movement of S1PR1-TMs 5-6, directly activating the receptor to engage the 
heterotrimeric G i . Mutations in key residues at the interface affect the 
interactions between CD69 and S1PR1, as well as reduce the receptor 
internalization. Thus, our structural findings along with functional analyses 
demonstrate that CD69 acts in cis as a protein agonist of S1PR1, thereby 
promoting G i -dependent S1PR1 internalization, loss of S1P gradient sensing,

Cell analysis from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is a valuable tool in the 
diagnostic workup and differential diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Besides the 
expansion of lymphocyte expression-specific receptor segments (Vα2.3 and Vβ22) 
in some patients with certain HLA types, the relation between sarcoidosis 
susceptibility and BAL cell populations' quantitative levels is not 
well-understood.
METHODS: Quantitative levels defined by cell concentrations of BAL cells and 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio were evaluated together with genetic variants associated with 
sarcoidosis in 692 patients with extensive clinical data. Genetic variants 
associated with clinical phenotypes, Löfgren's syndrome (LS) and non-Löfgren's 
syndrome (non-LS), were examined separately. An association test via linear 
regression using an additive model adjusted for sex, age, and correlated cell 
type was applied. To infer the biological function of genetic associations, 
enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait (eQTLs) across publicly 
available eQTL databases was conducted.
RESULTS: Multiple genetic variants associated with sarcoidosis were 
significantly associated with quantitative levels of BAL cells. Specifically, LS 
genetic variants, mainly from the HLA locus, were associated with quantitative 
levels of BAL macrophages, lymphocytes, CD3+ cells, CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Non-LS genetic 
variants were associated with quantitative levels of BAL macrophages, CD8+ 
cells, basophils, and eosinophils. eQTL enrichment revealed an influence of 
sarcoidosis-associated SNPs and regulation of gene expression in the lung, 
blood, and immune cells.
CONCLUSION: Genetic variants associated with sarcoidosis are likely to modulate 
quantitative levels of BAL cell types and may regulate gene expression in immune 
cell populations. Thus, the role of sarcoidosis-associated gene-variants may be 
to influence cellular phenotypes underlying the disease immunopathology.","Copyright © 2023 Abo Al Hayja, Kullberg, Eklund, Padyukov, Grunewald and Rivera.","DOI: 10.3389/fmed.2023.1061654

intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) who received adjuvant chemotherapy after 
radical resection. Methods: The clinical and pathological data of 249 patients 
with ICC who underwent radical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy at 8 
hospitals in China from January 2010 to December 2018 were retrospectively 
collected. There were 121 males and 128 females,with 88 cases>60 years old and 
161 cases≤60 years old. Feature selection was performed by univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis. Overall survival time and survival status 
were used as outcome indicators,then target clinical features were selected. 
Patients were stratified into high-risk group and low-risk group,survival 
differences between the two groups were analyzed. Using the selected clinical 
features, the traditional CoxPH model and deep learning DeepSurv survival 
prediction model were constructed, and the performance of the models were 
evaluated according to concordance index(C-index). Results: Portal vein 
invasion, carcinoembryonic antigen>5 μg/L,abnormal lymphocyte count, low grade 
tumor pathological differentiation and positive lymph nodes>0 were independent 
adverse prognostic factors for overall survival in 249 patients with adjuvant 
chemotherapy after radical resection (all P<0.05). The survival benefit of 
adjuvant chemotherapy in the high-risk group was significantly lower than that 
in the low-risk group (P<0.05). Using the above five features, the traditional 
CoxPH model and the deep learning DeepSurv survival prediction model were 
constructed. The C-index values of the training set were 0.687 and 0.770, and 
the C-index values of the test set were 0.606 and 0.763,respectively. 
Conclusion: Compared with the traditional Cox model, the DeepSurv model can more 
accurately predict the survival probability of patients with ICC undergoing 
adjuvant chemotherapy at a certain time point, and more accurately judge the 
survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.","Publisher: 目的： 建立肝内胆管癌根治性切除术后辅助化疗患者生存获益的预测模型。 方法：

regions are removed from premature RNA to create mature mRNA, regulates various 
cellular functions, such as proliferation, survival, and differentiation. 
Clinical and functional studies over the past 10 y have confirmed that mutations 
in RNA splicing factors are among the most recurrent genetic abnormalities in 
hematologic neoplasms, including myeloid malignancies, chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and clonal hematopoiesis. These findings 
indicate an important role for splicing factor mutations in the development of 
clonal hematopoietic disorders. Mutations in core or accessory components of the 
RNA spliceosome complex alter splicing sites in a manner of change of function. 
These changes can result in the dysregulation of cancer-associated gene 
expression and the generation of novel mRNA transcripts, some of which are not 
only critical to disease development but may be also serving as potential 
therapeutic targets. Furthermore, multiple studies have revealed that 
hematopoietic cells bearing mutations in splicing factors depend on the 
expression of the residual wild-type allele for survival, and these cells are 
more sensitive to reduced expression of wild-type splicing factors or chemical 
perturbations of the splicing machinery. These findings suggest a promising 
possibility for developing novel therapeutic opportunities in tumor cells based 
on mutations in splicing factors. Here, we combine current knowledge of the 
mechanistic and functional effects of frequently mutated splicing factors in 
normal hematopoiesis and the effects of their mutations in hematologic 
malignancies. Moreover, we discuss the development of potential therapeutic 
opportunities based on these mutations.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Society

systemic hematologic makers are associated with malignancy, but their value in 
predicting aggressive meningioma behavior is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between preoperative markers such as 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil-monocyte ratio (NMR), 
monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and prognostic 
nutritional index (PNI), and diagnostic and prognostic factors including WHO 
grade, proliferation index, presence of edema on preoperative MRI, and tumor 
recurrence.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated between 2000 and 2019 with a 
preoperative complete blood count (CBC) differential lab draw before 
intracranial meningioma resection was conducted. All preoperative steroid 
dosages were converted to dexamethasone equivalents. Primary outcomes included 
presence/absence of perilesional edema, WHO grade, Ki-67/MIB-index, and 
recurrence. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 209 meningioma patients were included. Of these, 143 (68 %) 
were WHO grade I, 61 (29 %) grade II and 5 (2 %) were grade III. Recurrence was 
reported in 19 (9.1 %) tumors. No hematologic markers were associated with 
recurrence. In separate multivariable logistic analyses, no biomarkers were 
associated with perilesional edema or WHO grade. MLR was associated with higher 
MIB-index (p = 0.018, OR 6.57, 95 % CI 1.37-30.91).
CONCLUSION: Most hematologic markers were not associated with meningioma 
invasiveness, grade, proliferative index, or aggressiveness. Preoperative MLR 
was associated with high proliferation index in patients undergoing surgery for 
intracranial meningioma. Higher MLR could be a surrogate for meningioma 
proliferation and has potential to be used as an adjunct for risk-stratifying 
meningiomas.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.clineuro.2023.107629

cells. It differs from other inflammatory conditions by causing significant 
alterations in epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation that are both 
complicated and prominent. The lack of an appropriate animal model has 
significantly hindered studies into the pathogenic mechanisms of psoriasis since 
animals other than humans typically do not exhibit the complex phenotypic 
features of human psoriasis. A variety of methods, including spontaneous 
mutations, drug-induced mutations, genetically engineered animals, 
xenotransplantation models, and immunological reconstitution approaches, have 
all been employed to study specific characteristics in the pathogenesis of 
psoriasis. Although some of these approaches have been used for more than 
50 years and far more models have been introduced recently, they have 
surprisingly not yet undergone detailed validation. Despite their limitations, 
these models have shown a connection between keratinocyte hyperplasia, vascular 
hyperplasia, and a cell-mediated immune response in the skin. The 
xenotransplantation of diseased or unaffected human skin onto immune-compromised 
recipients has also significantly aided psoriasis research. This technique has 
been used in a variety of ways to investigate the function of T lymphocytes and 
other cells, including preclinical therapeutic studies. The design of pertinent 
in vivo and in vitro psoriasis models is currently of utmost concern and a 
crucial step toward its cure. This article outlines the general approach in the

heterogeneous group of disorders with a clinical subset that may differ in 
prognosis and therapy. We provide a comprehensive update on the clinical 
assessment, diagnosis, complications, treatment, and follow-up of PNSV.
RECENT FINDINGS: Progress in neuroimaging, molecular testing, and peripheral 
nerve biopsy has improved clinical assessment and decision-making of PNSV, also 
providing novel insights on how to prevent misdiagnosis and increase diagnostic 
certainty. Advances in imaging techniques, allowing to clearly display the 
vessel walls, have also enhanced the possibility to differentiate inflammatory 
from non-inflammatory vascular lesions, while recent histopathology data have 
identified the main morphological criteria for more accurate diagnosis and 
differential diagnoses. Overall, the identification of peculiar morphological 
findings tends to improve diagnostic accuracy by defining a clearer boundary 
between systemic and non-systemic neuropathies. Therefore, the definition of 
epineurium vessel wall damage, type of vascular lesion, characterization of 
lymphocyte populations, antibodies, and inflammatory factors, as well as the 
identification of direct nerve damage or degeneration, are the common goals for 
pathologists and clinicians, who will both benefit for data integration and 
findings translation. Nevertheless, to date, treatment is still largely empiric 
and, in some cases, unsatisfactory, thus often precluding precise prognostic 
prediction. In this context, new diagnostic techniques and multidisciplinary 
management will be essential in the proper diagnosis and prompt management of 
PNSV, as highlighted in the present review. Thirty to fifty percent of all 
patients with vasculitis have signs of polyneuropathy. Neuropathies associated 
with systemic vasculitis are best managed according to the guidelines of the 
underlying disease because appropriate workup and initiation of treatment can 
reduce morbidity. Steroids, or in severe or progressive cases, cyclophosphamide 
pulse therapy is the standard therapy in non-systemic vasculitic neuropathies. 
Some patients need long-term immunosuppression. The use of novel technologies 
for high-throughput genotyping will permit to determine the genetic influence of 
related phenotypes in patients with PNSV.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

chemically manipulated for a broad spectrum of biomedical applications. However, 
their toxicity may hinder their actual use. Here, Spinacia oleracea-derived CQDs 
i.e., CQD-1 and CQD-2, were synthesized by means of different shredding methods 
and followed by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach. Subsequently, these 
CQDs were analyzed in vitro and in an in vivo mice model to test their 
biocompatibility and potential use as bioimaging agents and for activation of 
osteogenic differentiation. When comparing CQD-1 and CQD-2, it was found that 
CQD-1 exhibited 7.6 times higher photoluminescent (PL) emission intensity around 
411 nm compared to CQD-2. Besides, it was found that the size distribution of 
CQD-1 was 2.05 ± 0.08 nm, compared with 2.14 ± 0.04 nm for CQD-2. Upon exposure 
to human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in vitro, CQD-1 was 
endocytosed into the cytoplasm and significantly increased the differentiation 
of hBMSCs up to 10 μg mL-1 after 7 and 14 days. Apparently, the presence of 
relatively low doses of CQD-1 showed virtually no toxic or histological effects 
in the major organs in vivo. In contrast, high doses of CQD-1 (1 mg mL-1) caused 
cell death in vitro ranging from 35% on day 1 to 80% on day 3 post-exposure, and 
activated the apoptotic machinery and increased lymphocyte aggregates in the 
liver tissue. In conclusion, S. oleracea-derived CQDs have the potential for 
biomedical applications in bioimaging and activation of stem cells osteogenic 
differentiation. Therefore, it is postulated that CQD-1 from S. oleracea remains 
potential prospective material at appropriate doses and specifications.",© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e13422

β2-microglobulin transgenic rat (B27-rat) is correlated with altered 
conventional dendritic cell (cDC) function that promotes an inflammatory pattern 
of CD4+T cells, including a biased expansion of pro-inflammatory Th17 population 
and imbalance of regulatory T cells cytokine profile. Transcriptomic analysis 
revealed that cDCs from B27-rats under express IL-27, an anti-inflammatory 
cytokine which induces the differentiation of IL-10+ regulatory T cells and 
inhibits Th17 cells.
METHODS: Here, we first investigated whether in vitro addition of exogenous 
IL-27 could reverse the inflammatory pattern observed in CD4+ T cells. Next, we 
performed preclinical assay using IL-27 to investigate whether in vivo treatment 
could prevent SpA development in B27-rats.
RESULTS: in vitro addition of IL-27 to cocultures of cDCs and CD4+ T cell 
subsets from B27-rats reduced IL-17 and enhanced IL-10 production by T cells. 
Likewise, IL-27 inhibited the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T cells from SpA 
patients. Interestingly, in vivo treatment with recombinant IL-27 starting 
before SpA onset, inhibited SpA development in B27-rats through the suppression 
of IL-17/TNF producing CD4+ T cells.
DISCUSSION: Overall, our results reveal a potent inhibitory effect of IL-27 and 
highlight this cytokine as a promising new therapeutic target in SpA, especially 
for SpA patients non responders to currently approved biotherapies.","Copyright © 2023 Jouhault, Cherqaoui, Jobart-Malfait, Glatigny, Lauraine, Hulot,

multifocal inflammatory demyelination of the central nervous system, occurs 
predominantly in children and young adults. We report an autopsy case of an 
elderly man with brainstem ADEM that progressed over a period of about 3 months. 
An 82-year-old man developed disturbance of consciousness, dysphagia, and ataxic 
gait over a period of about 3 months. He was admitted to another hospital for 
aspiration pneumonia and recovered but was transferred to our hospital due to 
prolonged disturbance of consciousness. The patient was able to follow simple 
commands but had a tendency to somnolence. In addition to meningeal stimulation 
signs, the patient had left-dominant upper and lower limb ataxia and 
right-dominant limb spasticity. Brain FLAIR/T2-weighted imaging showed 
high-intensity lesions from the brainstem to the middle cerebellar peduncle 
bilaterally, medulla oblongata and upper cervical spinal cord, and T1-weighted 
imaging revealed contrast-enhanced lesions in the left middle cerebellar 
peduncle and cervical spinal cord. Although spinal fluid examination revealed 
elevated proteins, other laboratory tests indicated no evidence of infection, 
vasculitis, collagen diseases or tumors, and anti-ganglioside, anti-AQP4 and 
anti-MOG antibodies were negative. After admission, the patient again developed 
aspiration pneumonia, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
and he died on the 15th day of hospitalization. Autopsy findings indicated acute 
and subacute demyelination mainly in the brainstem and cerebellum, and 
perivascular lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration in the areas of 
demyelination. A postmortem diagnosis of ADEM was made based on the generally 
monophasic course of the disease and the absence of regenerating myelinated 
sheaths. There are very few reports of elderly patients with brainstem ADEM. 
ADEM should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with brainstem 
encephalitis.","© 2023 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000529180

response to T cell specific antigens. GCs are specialized structures within 
secondary lymphoid organs, in which B cell proliferation, somatic hypermutation 
and antibody affinity maturation occur. As a result, high affinity antibody 
secreting plasma cells and memory B cells are generated. An effective GC 
response needs interaction between multiple cell types. Besides reticular cells 
and follicular dendritic cells, particularly B cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) 
cells as well as T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells are a key player during the 
GC reaction. Whereas Tfh cells provide help to GC B cells in selection 
processes, Tfr cells, a specialized subset of regulatory T cells (Tregs), are 
able to suppress the GC reaction maintaining the balance between immune 
activation and tolerance. The formation and function of GCs is regulated by a 
complex network of signals and molecules at multiple levels. In this review, we 
highlight recent developments in GC biology by focusing on the transcriptional 
program regulating the GC reaction. This review focuses on the transcriptional 
co-activator BOB.1/OBF.1, whose important role for GC B, Tfh and Tfr cell 
differentiation became increasingly clear in recent years. Moreover, we outline 
how deregulation of the GC transcriptional program can drive lymphomagenesis.","Copyright © 2023 Betzler, Ushmorov and Brunner.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1125503

preventing COVID-19 infection but there are limited data on the types and 
persistence of the humoral and T cell responses to such a vaccine.
METHODS: Here, we dissect the vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses in 
a cohort of six healthy recipients of two doses of this vaccine.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Overall, there was heterogeneity in the spike-specific 
humoral and cellular responses among vaccinated individuals. Interestingly, we 
demonstrated that anti-spike antibody levels detected by a novel simple 
automated assay (Jess) were strongly correlated (r=0.863, P<0.0001) with 
neutralizing activity; thus, providing a potential surrogate for neutralizing 
cell-based assays. The spike-specific T cell response was measured with a newly 
modified T-spot assay in which the high-homology peptide-sequences 
cross-reactive with other coronaviruses were removed. This response was induced 
in 4/6 participants after the first dose, and all six participants after the 
second dose, and remained detectable in 4/6 participants five months 
post-vaccination. We have also shown for the first time, that BNT162b2 vaccine 
enhanced T cell responses also against known human common viruses. In addition, 
we demonstrated the efficacy of a rapid ex-vivo T cell expansion protocol for 
spike-specific T cell expansion to be potentially used for adoptive-cell therapy 
in severe COVID-19, immunocompromised individuals, and other high-risk groups. 
There was a 9 to 13.7-fold increase in the number of expanded T cells with a 
significant increase of anti-spike specific response showing higher frequencies 
of both activation and cytotoxic markers. Interestingly, effector memory T cells 
were dominant in all four participants' CD8+ expanded memory T cells; CD4+ T 
cells were dominated by effector memory in 2/4 participants and by central 
memory in the remaining two participants. Moreover, we found that high 
frequencies of CD4+ terminally differentiated memory T cells were associated 
with a greater reduction of spike-specific activated CD4+ T cells. Finally, we 
showed that participants who had a CD4+ central memory T cell dominance 
expressed a high CD69 activation marker in the CD4+ activated T cells.","Copyright © 2023 Mestiri, Merhi, Inchakalody, Taib, Smatti, Ahmad, Raza, Ali,

Ebola survivors, generally described as a post-Ebola syndrome, remains a public 
health concern. We aimed to analyze Ebola survivors' laboratory biomarkers as 
compared to their non-infected household relatives to identify biomarkers that 
could guide the identification of survivors at increased risk of developing 
severe at odds with the non-severe post-Ebola syndrome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were extracted from medical records of the Ebola 
survivors clinic, and we included only Ebola survivor's parameters recorded 
during the first baseline follow-up visit 2 weeks interval after their second 
negative PCR result. Moreover, household non-infected family contacts of 
survivors visiting the clinic during the same period were recruited as community 
control.
RESULTS: The mean age of survivors was 32.65 (IQR: 15.5, 38.25) years, and Ebola 
IgG immunoglobulin was detected in all, thus confirming their status. The 
statistical significance (all p < 0.05) observed in monocyte percentage (MONO%), 
cluster of differentiation 4 percentage (CD4%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
creatinine (CREA), and creatinine kinase (C-kinase) proved to be clinically 
significant as compared to the household relatives' group. Interestingly, the 
linear regression analysis indicated that the duration at ETU was negatively 
associated with lymphocyte percentage with a 5% lymphocyte decrease per day 
spent at ETU. Finally, there was a significant (p < 0.05) association between 
hematological (Hb, PCV, MCV, MCH), biochemical (ALT, CREA, C-kinase, 
T-cholesterol, triglycerides) parameters and the risk of developing severe 
complications.
CONCLUSION: We recommend clinicians closely monitor Hb, PCV, MCV, MCH, ALT, 
CREA, C-kinase, T-cholesterol, triglycerides and lymphocytes as clinically 
relevant laboratory biomarkers to identify survivors at higher risk of 
developing severe post-acute syndrome upon discharge from Ebola treatment unit 
including headache, abdominal pain, chest pain, ocular complication, arthralgia, 
hearing difficulty and erectile dysfunction which can impact health-related

profiles. Although whole-genome methylation studies indicated that effects 
observed in blood may be driven by changes within leukocyte subtypes, these 
phenomena have not been explored using expression profiling.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study reanalyzed data from the Correlated Expression 
and Disease Association Research (CEDAR) patient cohort recruited by Momozawa et 
al. (E-MTAB-6667). Data from gene expression profiling of immunomagnetically 
sorted CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD15+, and CD19+ cells were processed. Differential 
expression analyses were conducted in each immune cell type, followed by gene 
ontology analysis and supplementary investigations.
RESULTS: Ninety-four differentially expressed genes were found (CD8+ n = 58, 
CD14+ n = 20, CD4+ n = 14, CD19+ n = 2). Two key smoking-related genes were 
overexpressed in specific cell types: LRRN3 (CD4+, CD8+) and MMP25 (CD8+, 
CD14+). In CD4+ cells smoking was associated with reduced expression of the NK 
cell receptor KLRB1, suggesting CD4+ subpopulation shifts and differences in 
interferon signaling (reduced IRF1 and IL18RAP in smokers). Key results and 
their integration with an immune protein-protein interaction network revealed 
that smoking influences integrins in CD8+ cells (ITGB7, ITGAL, ITGAM, ITGB2). 
C-type lectin CLEC4A was reduced in CD8+ cells and CLEC10A was increased in 
CD14+ cells from smokers; moreover, CLEC5A (CD8+), CLEC7A (CD8+) and CLEC9A 
(CD19+) were related to smoking in supplementary analyses. CD14+ cells from 
smokers exhibited overexpression of LDLR and the formyl peptide receptor FPR3.

lymphocyte subtypes, especially CD4+, CD8+ and CD14+ cells.",Copyright © 2022 Termedia.,"DOI: 10.5114/ceji.2022.120618

they comprise type 1 and type 2 papillary, chromophobe, unclassified, and other 
histologies (medullary, collecting duct carcinoma, and 
translocation-associated). Molecular knowledge has allowed the identification of 
some other specific subtypes, such as fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) or succinate dehydrogenase-associated RCC. In addition, it has 
recognized some alterations with a possible predictive role, e.g., MET 
proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) alterations in papillary tumors. 
Standard therapies for the management of advanced clear cell RCC (ccRCC), i.e., 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) pathway inhibitors and 
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, have shown poorer results in nccRCC 
patients. Therefore, there is a need to improve the efficacy of the treatment 
for advanced nccRCC. Immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs) targeting programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 and cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), has demonstrated a significant 
survival benefit in several malignant neoplasias, including ccRCC, with a 
proportion of patients achieving long survival. The combinations of ICI or ICI + 
VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard of care in advanced 
ccRCC. Unfortunately, major pivotal trials did not include specific nccRCC 
populations. In recent years, several studies have retrospectively or 
prospectively evaluated ICIs alone or in combination with another ICI or with 
TKIs in nccRCC patients. In this article, we review data from available trials 
in order to elucidate clinical and molecular profiles that could benefit from 
immunotherapy approaches.","Copyright © 2023 Climent, Soriano, Bonfill, Lopez, Rodriguez, Sierra, Andreu,

especially in progressive patients. Immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs) is considered to be a promising treatment option for OS. Due 
to tumor heterogeneity, only a minority of patients benefit from immunotherapy. 
Therefore, it is urgent to explore a model that can accurately assess the 
response of OS to immunotherapy. In this study, we obtained the single-cell RNA 
sequencing datasets of OS patients from public databases and defined 34 cell 
clusters by dimensional reduction and clustering analysis. PTPRC was applied to 
identify immune cell clusters and nonimmune cell clusters. Next, we performed 
clustering analysis on the immune cell clusters and obtained 25 immune cell 
subclusters. Immune cells were labeled with CD8A and CD8B to obtain CD8+ T cell 
clusters. Meanwhile, we extracted the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of 
CD8+ T cell clusters and other immune cell clusters. Furthermore, we constructed 
a prognostic model (CD8-DEG model) based on the obtained DEGs of CD8+ T cells, 
and verified the excellent predictive ability of this model for the prognosis of 
OS. Moreover, we further investigated the value of the CD8-DEG model. The 
results indicated that the risk score of the CD8-DEG model was an independent 
risk factor for OS patients. Finally, we revealed that the risk score of the 
CD8-DEG model correlates with the immune profile of OS and can be used to 
evaluate the response of OS to immunotherapy. In conclusion, our study revealed 
the critical role of CD8 cells in OS. The risk score model based on CD8-DEGs can 
provide guidance for prognosis and immunotherapy of OS.",Copyright © 2023 Yu Chen et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/6563609

to death. Different types of leukemia have been reported, and several genetic 
and environmental factors are involved in their development. The Philadelphia 
chromosome causes the most common mutation known as breakpoint cluster 
region-Abelson oncogene (BCR-ABL1), which shows abnormal protein tyrosine kinase 
(PTK) activity. Basically, this activity is accountable for activating multiple 
pathways, including the inhibition of cell differentiation, controlled 
proliferation, and cell death. As a result of the absence of kinase activity, 
this mutation leads to the uncontrolled proliferation of leukocytes, causing 
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid 
leukemia (ALL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study aimed to 
evaluate the level of BCR-ABL1 expression in patients with these types of 
leukemias through qPCR. In brief, PBMCs were isolated from blood samples of 
patients, RNA was extracted from PBMCs, cDNA was synthesized, and the transcript 
levels of BCR-ABL1 in patients with each type of leukemia were determined by 
qPCR. The clinical, demographical, and experimental data were analyzed among 
CML, AML, and ALL patients. Results: The BCR-ABL1 expression levels are variable 
in all studied groups and are 90, 30-35, and 1-2.5% in CML, ALL, and AML, 
respectively. Demographic characteristics such as gender, BMI, age, family 
history, and clinical parameters along with CBC are also associated with the 
prevalence and diagnosis of leukemia. In a comparative expression analysis, the 
expression of BCR-ABL1 is onefold high in AML, but four- and sevenfold high in 
ALL and CML, respectively, as compared with normal levels. Conclusions: In this 
study, a significant difference was observed in the expression levels of 
BCR-ABL1 between CML (p = 0.0043) and ALL (p = 0.0006) and between CML and AML 
groups, and a high expression of BCR-ABL1 was noted in CML as compared with ALL 
and AML.",© 2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.,"DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.2c07885

clinical data, blood test indexes, and ventilation function test indexes on the 
severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: A total of 141 clinical characteristics of COPD patients admitted to 
our hospital were collected. A mild-to-moderate group and a severe group were 
classified depending on the severity of COPD, and their baseline data were 
compared. The predictive factors of severe COPD were analyzed by univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression, and the nomogram model of severe COPD was 
constructed. The clinical variables, including gender, height, weight, body mass 
index (BMI), age, course, diabetes, hypertension, smoking history, WBC, NEUT, 
lymphocyte count (LY), MONO, eosinophil count (EOS), PLT, mean platelet volume 
(MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and 
PaCO2, were collected.
RESULTS: There were 67 mild-to-moderate COPD patients and 74 severe COPD 
patients in this study cohort. Severe COPD had a higher white blood cell count 
(WBC), neutrophil count (NEUT), monocyte count (MONO), platelet count (PLT), 
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and a lower partial pressure of carbon 
dioxide (PaCO2). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that WBC, NEUT, 
MONO, PLT, and NLR were contributing factors of severe COPD, while PaCO2 was an 
unfavorable factor of severe COPD. Enter, forward, backward, and stepwise 
multivariate logistic regression analyses all showed that NEUT and PLT were 
independent contributing factors to severe COPD. Moreover, the nomogram model 
had good predictive ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve being 0.881. Good calibration and clinical 
utility were validated through the calibration plot and the decision curve 
analysis (DCA) plot, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The severity of COPD was correlated with NEUT and PLT, and the

longevity by ensuring prompt treatment for graft complications. Although 
histologic assessment remains the gold standard, it carries significant 
limitations such as subjective interpretation, suboptimal reproducibility, and 
imprecise quantitation of disease burden. It is hoped that molecular diagnostics 
could enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility of traditional 
histologic methods.
METHODS: Quantitative label-free mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a 
set of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies from kidney transplant 
patients, including five samples each with diagnosis of T-cell-mediated 
rejection (TCMR), polyomavirus BK nephropathy (BKPyVN), and stable (STA) kidney 
function control tissue. Using the differential protein expression result as a 
classifier, three different machine learning algorithms were tested to build a 
molecular diagnostic model for TCMR.
RESULTS: The label-free proteomics method yielded 800-1350 proteins that could 
be quantified with high confidence per sample by single-shot measurements. Among 
these candidate proteins, 329 and 467 proteins were defined as differentially 
expressed proteins (DEPs) for TCMR in comparison with STA and BKPyVN, 
respectively. Comparing the FFPE quantitative proteomics data set obtained in 
this study using label-free method with a data set we previously reported using 
isobaric labeling technology, a classifier pool comprised of features from DEPs 
commonly quantified in both data sets, was generated for TCMR prediction. 
Leave-one-out cross-validation result demonstrated that the random forest 
(RF)-based model achieved the best predictive power. In a follow-up blind test 
using an independent sample set, the RF-based model yields 80% accuracy for TCMR 
and 100% for STA. When applying the established RF-based model to two public 
transcriptome datasets, 78.1%-82.9% sensitivity and 58.7%-64.4% specificity was 
achieved respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the clinical feasibility 
of proteomics profiling for FFPE biopsies using an accurate, efficient, and 
cost-effective platform integrated of quantitative label-free mass spectrometry 
analysis with a machine learning-based diagnostic model. It costs less than 10 
dollars per test.","Copyright © 2023 Fang, Liu, Song, Wagner, Bartlett, Ma, Li, Rahimian, Tseng,

protein with many context-specific functions. Early studies of lymphocyte TRAF3 
hinted at TRAF3's importance for T cell function, but elucidation of specific 
mechanisms was delayed by early lethality of globally TRAF3-/- mice. Development 
of a conditional TRAF3-deficient mouse enabled important descriptive and 
mechanistic insights into how TRAF3 promotes optimal T cell function. Signaling 
through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) fails to induce normal proliferation 
and survival in TRAF3 -/- T cells, and TCR-activated cells in vitro and in vivo 
have deficient cytokine production. These defects can be traced to incorrect 
localization and function of negative regulatory phosphatases acting at 
different parts of the signaling cascade, as can dysregulated effector responses 
and memory T cell homeostasis in vivo and an enlarged regulatory T cell (Treg) 
compartment. The important regulatory activity of TRAF3 is also evident at 
members of the TNFR superfamily and cytokine receptors. Here, we review 
significant advances in mechanistic understanding of how TRAF3 regulates T cell 
differentiation and function, through modulation of signaling through the TCR, 
costimulatory receptors, and cytokine receptors. Finally, we briefly discuss the 
recent identification of families carrying single allele loss-of-function 
mutations in TRAF3, and compare the findings in their T cells with the T cell 
defects identified in mice whose T cells completely lack T cell TRAF3. Together,

chemoresistance, immunotherapy failure and tumor recurrence. Multiple 
immunosuppressive cells and soluble secreted cytokines together drive and 
accelerate TME disorders, T cell immunodeficiency and tumor growth. Thus, it is 
essential to comprehensively understand the TME status, immune cells involved 
and key transcriptional factors, and extend this knowledge to therapies that 
target dysfunctional T cells in the TME. Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) 
is a unique IRF family member that is not regulated by interferons, instead, is 
mainly induced upon T-cell receptor signaling, Toll-like receptors and tumor 
necrosis factor receptors. IRF4 is largely restricted to immune cells and plays 
critical roles in the differentiation and function of effector cells and 
immunosuppressive cells, particularly during clonal expansion and the effector 
function of T cells. However, in a specific biological context, it is also 
involved in the transcriptional process of T cell exhaustion with its binding 
partners. Given the multiple effects of IRF4 on immune cells, especially T 
cells, manipulating IRF4 may be an important therapeutic target for reversing T 
cell exhaustion and TME disorders, thus promoting anti-tumor immunity. This 
study reviews the regulatory effects of IRF4 on various immune cells in the TME,

therapeutic method for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). 
Growing evidence indicates that tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the 
tumour microenvironment are a prerequisite for the effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 
blockade therapy. In this study, we aimed to compare PD-L1 expression and 
cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and CD8 TIL infiltration in primary tumours 
and paired metastases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Altogether, 111 patients with mCRC who underwent surgery 
at our hospital were included. PD-L1, CD4, and CD8 expression were detected by 
immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray. PD-L1 expression was assessed using 
the combined positivity score (CPS), and a score ≥1 was judged as positive. The 
area proportion of TILs with positive staining ≥10% was classified as ""high"", 
while <10% was classified as ""low"".
RESULTS: We observed the discordance of PD-L1 expression between primary tumours 
and paired metastases in 35/111 (31.5%) patients (κ = 0.137, P = 0.142). This 
heterogeneity was significantly correlated with discordance of CD8 TIL 
infiltration between primary tumours and paired metastases (P = 0.003). Compared 
with corresponding colorectal cancer tumours, lung metastases showed more CD8 
TIL infiltration (P = 0.022, median: 8.5% vs. 5.0%), whereas liver metastases 
exhibited less CD8 TIL infiltration (P = 0.028, median: 3.0% vs. 5.0%). Area 
proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ TIL infiltration in lung metastases were all higher 
than those in liver metastases (P = 0.005, median: 15.0% vs. 9.0%; P = 0.001, 
median: 8.5% vs. 3.0%). Compared with p MMR (MSI-L/MS-S) subgroup, area 
proportion of CD8 TIL infiltration in primary tumours and CD4, CD8 TIL 
infiltration in paired metastases were all higher in d MMR (MSI-H) group 
(P = 0.026, median: 15.0% vs 5.0%; P = 0.039, median: 15.0% vs 9.0%; P = 0.015, 
median: 15.0% vs 5.0%). Preoperative chemo/radiotherapy may increase CD8 TIL 
infiltration in primary tumours (P = 0.045, median: 10.0% vs. 5.0%). CD8 TIL 
infiltration in primary tumours was an independent predictive factor for overall 
survival (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09-0.93, P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity in PD-L1 expression and CD8 TIL infiltration was found 
between primary tumours and paired metastases in mCRC. CD8 TIL infiltration in 
primary tumours could independently forecast the overall survival of patients 
with mCRC.",© 2023 The Authors.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e13048

symptoms, cytopenia(s), and systemic lymphadenopathy, raising clinical suspicion 
for lymphoma and prompting lymph node and bone marrow biopsies. At the 
microscopic level, the histopathologic findings in cases of acute EBV 
lymphadenitis may mimic certain lymphoid neoplasms, creating a range of 
differential diagnoses and diagnostic pitfalls.We present a case of fulminant 
EBV infection in an adolescent whose clinical and radiographic findings led to 
lymph node and bone marrow biopsies to rule out lymphoma. One week after being 
diagnosed with acute EBV infection (infectious mononucleosis), a 17-year-old 
Caucasian male presented with worsening symptoms including persistent fever, 
progressive, painful lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. A peripheral blood smear 
showed lymphocytosis with many reactive lymphocytes, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia. Laboratory studies showed elevated ferritin, triglycerides, 
and soluble IL-2/CD25. A cervical lymph node biopsy demonstrated an 
EBV-positive, reactive B-immunoblast proliferation with large atypical lymphoid 
cells mimicking Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin lymphoma, in addition to patchy 
vasculitis, coagulative necrosis, and prominent hemophagocytic activity. 
Bilateral bone marrow biopsies showed a hypercellular marrow with patchy 
infiltrates of similar EBV-positive, large atypical lymphoid cells, as well as 
prominent hemophagocytic activity. The diagnosis of acute EBV associated 
lymphoproliferation with concurrent hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was 
rendered.Recognition of common and uncommon clinical presentations of acute EBV 
infection is essential, particularly when histopathologic findings raise 
suspicion for a possible hematolymphoid neoplasm. Both the lymph node 
architectural and viral cytopathic changes observed in EBV lymphadenitis exhibit 
significant morphologic overlap with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and several 
other lymphomas, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma, diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma, and angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. Recognition of 
immunohistochemical staining patterns in EBV lymphadenitis is critical to avoid 
misdiagnosis. Conversely, bona fide lymphoma, particularly cHL, can masquerade 
as EBV infection. We provide a concise discussion and tables of the 
histopathologic differential diagnosis of EBV lymphadenitis, including cHL and 
other lymphomas. Pathologists should include acute EBV infection within the 
differential diagnosis when confronted with clinical and pathologic findings 
concerning for lymphoma, particularly in adolescents and young adults.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13000-023-01307-x

and growth impairments. Individuals with DS are also prone to severe 
infections and autoimmunity including thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, coeliac 
disease and alopecia areata1,2. Here, to investigate the mechanisms underlying 
autoimmune susceptibility, we mapped the soluble and cellular immune landscape 
of individuals with DS. We found a persistent elevation of up to 22 cytokines at 
steady state (at levels often exceeding those in patients with acute infection) 
and detected basal cellular activation: chronic IL-6 signalling in CD4 T cells 
and a high proportion of plasmablasts and CD11c+TbethighCD21low B cells (Tbet is 
also known as TBX21). This subset is known to be autoimmune-prone and displayed 
even greater autoreactive features in DS including receptors with fewer 
non-reference nucleotides and higher IGHV4-34 utilization. In vitro, incubation 
of naive B cells in the plasma of individuals with DS or with IL-6-activated T 
cells resulted in increased plasmablast differentiation compared with control 
plasma or unstimulated T cells, respectively. Finally, we detected 365 
auto-antibodies in the plasma of individuals with DS, which targeted the 
gastrointestinal tract, the pancreas, the thyroid, the central nervous system, 
and the immune system itself. Together, these data point to an 
autoimmunity-prone state in DS, in which a steady-state cytokinopathy, 
hyperactivated CD4 T cells and ongoing B cell activation all contribute to a 
breach in immune tolerance. Our findings also open therapeutic paths, as we 
demonstrate that T cell activation is resolved not only with broad 
immunosuppressants such as Jak inhibitors, but also with the more tailored 
approach of IL-6 inhibition.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-05736-y

relatively favorable, serious complications may occur. This study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between blood parameters and the occurrence of 
in-hospital complications.
METHODS: Clinical charts of 51 patients with TTS were retrospectively evaluated, 
and data regarding blood parameters assessed during the first 24 hours of 
hospitalization were studied.
RESULTS: Levels of hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women (P < 
0.01), levels of mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) less than 
33 g/dL (P = 0.01), and levels of red blood cell distribution width-coefficient 
of variation higher than 14.5% (P = 0.01) were significantly associated to the 
occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Markers, such as, 
platelets to lymphocytes ratio, lymphocytes to monocytes ratio, neutrophils to 
lymphocytes ratio, and white blood cell count to mean platelet volume, were 
unable to differentiate patients with and without complications (P > 0.05). MCHC 
and estimated glomerular filtration rate were independent predictors of MACE.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood parameters may have a role in the stratification risk of 
patients with TTS. Patients showing low levels of MCHC and decreased estimated 
glomerular filtration rate were more likely to have in-hospital MACE. This 
should encourage physicians to closely monitor blood parameters in patients with 
TTS.","Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/HPC.0000000000000311

are at risk of developing shock. Our objectives were to determine independent 
predictors associated with development of delayed shock (≥3 hours from emergency 
department [ED] arrival) in patients with MIS-C and to derive a model predicting 
those at low risk for delayed shock.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of 22 pediatric EDs 
in the New York City tri-state area. We included patients meeting World Health 
Organization criteria for MIS-C and presented April 1 to June 30, 2020. Our main 
outcomes were to determine the association between clinical and laboratory 
factors to the development of delayed shock and to derive a laboratory-based 
prediction model based on identified independent predictors.
RESULTS: Of 248 children with MIS-C, 87 (35%) had shock and 58 (66%) had delayed 
shock. A C-reactive protein (CRP) level greater than 20 mg/dL (adjusted odds 
ratio [aOR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-12.1), lymphocyte percent 
less than 11% (aOR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7-8.6), and platelet count less than 
220,000/uL (aOR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.8-9.8) were independently associated with 
delayed shock. A prediction model including a CRP level less than 6 mg/dL, 
lymphocyte percent more than 20%, and platelet count more than 260,000/uL, 
categorized patients with MIS-C at low risk of developing delayed shock 
(sensitivity 93% [95% CI, 66-100], specificity 38% [95% CI, 22-55]).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum CRP, lymphocyte percent, and platelet count differentiated 
children at higher and lower risk for developing delayed shock. Use of these 
data can stratify the risk of progression to shock in patients with MIS-C, 
providing situational awareness and helping guide their level of care.","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/PEC.0000000000002914

or to an underlying chronic disease, is a key determinant to quality of life and 
mortality. However, cellular basis responsible for increased catabolism in 
myocytes often remains unclear. Although myocytes represent the vast majority of 
skeletal muscle cellular population, they are surrounded by numerous cells with 
various functions. Animal models, mostly rodents, can help to decipher the 
mechanisms behind this highly dynamic process, by allowing access to every 
muscle as well as time-course studies. Satellite cells (SCs) play a crucial role 
in muscle regeneration, within a niche also composed of fibroblasts and vascular 
and immune cells. Their proliferation and differentiation is altered in several 
models of muscle wasting such as cancer, chronic kidney disease or chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells are also 
responsible for functional muscle growth and repair and are associated in 
disease to muscle fibrosis such as in chronic kidney disease. Other cells have 
recently proven to have direct myogenic potential, such as pericytes. Outside 
their role in angiogenesis, endothelial cells and pericytes also participate to 
healthy muscle homoeostasis by promoting SC pool maintenance (so-called 
myogenesis-angiogenesis coupling). Their role in chronic diseases muscle wasting 
has been less studied. Immune cells are pivotal for muscle repair after injury: 
Macrophages undergo a transition from the M1 to the M2 state along with the 
transition between the inflammatory and resolutive phase of muscle repair. T 
regulatory lymphocytes promote and regulate this transition and are also able to 
activate SC proliferation and differentiation. Neural cells such as terminal 
Schwann cells, motor neurons and kranocytes are notably implicated in 
age-related sarcopenia. Last, newly identified cells in skeletal muscle, such as 
telocytes or interstitial tenocytes could play a role in tissular homoeostasis. 
We also put a special focus on cellular alterations occurring in COPD, a chronic 
and highly prevalent respiratory disease mainly linked to tobacco smoke 
exposure, where muscle wasting is strongly associated with increased mortality, 
and discuss the pros and cons of animal models versus human studies in this 
context. Finally, we discuss resident cells metabolism and present future 
promising leads for research, including the use of muscle organoids.","© 2022 The Authors. Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John

while factors in the tissue induce in situ TRM cell differentiation. Whether 
priming also regulates in situ TRM cell differentiation uncoupled from migration 
is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that T cell priming in the mesenteric lymph 
nodes (MLN) regulates CD103+ TRM cell differentiation in the intestine. In 
contrast, T cells primed in the spleen were impaired in the ability to 
differentiate into CD103+ TRM cells after entry into the intestine. MLN priming 
initiated a CD103+ TRM cell gene signature and licensed rapid CD103+ TRM cell 
differentiation in response to factors in the intestine. Licensing was regulated 
by retinoic acid signaling and primarily driven by factors other than CCR9 
expression and CCR9-mediated gut homing. Thus, the MLN is specialized to promote

studies, surgery has become the cornerstone of the treatment in patients with 
pulmonary oligometastatic sarcomas. Our study aimed to construct a composite 
prognostic score for metachronous oligometastatic sarcoma patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on data patients who underwent 
radical surgery for metachronous metastases in six research institutes from 
January 2010 to December 2018. The log-hazard ratio (HR) obtained from the Cox 
model was used to derive weighting factors for a continuous prognostic index 
designed to identify differential outcome risks.
RESULTS: A total of 251 patients were enrolled in the study. In the multivariate 
analysis, a longer disease-free interval (DFI) and a lower 
neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) were predictive of a better overall 
survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). A prognostic score was developed 
based on DFI and NLR data, identifying 2 risk class groups for DFS (3-years DFS 
20.2% for the high-risk group [HRG]and 46.4% for the low-risk group [LRG] 
[<0.0001]) and 3 risk groups for OS (3 years OS 53.9% for the HRG vs. 76.9% for 
the intermediate-risk group and 100% of the LRG (p < 0.0001)).
CONCLUSION: The proposed prognostic score effectively predicts outcomes for 
patients with lung metachronous oligo-metastases from the surgically treated 
sarcoma.",© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/jso.27219

    Mol Cell Biochem. 2023 Apr 4;:","Vimentin is a main type 3 intermediate filament protein. It seems that abnormal 
expression of vimentin is contributed to the appearance of the aggressive 
feature of cancer cells. So that it has been reported that malignancy and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in solid tumors, and poor clinical outcomes in 
patients with lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia have been 
associated with the high expression of vimentin. Vimentin is a non-caspase 
substrate of caspase-9 although its cleavage by caspase-9 in biological 
processes has not been reported. In the present study, we sought to understand 
whether vimentin cleavage mediated by caspase-9 could reverse the malignancy in 
leukemic cells. Herein, to address the issue, we investigated vimentin changes 
in differentiation and took advantage of the inducible caspase-9 (iC9)/AP1903 
system in human leukemic NB4 cells. Following the transfection and treatment of 
the cells using the iC9/AP1903 system, vimentin expression, cleavage, and 
subsequently, the cell invasion and the relevant markers such as CD44 and MMP-9 
were evaluated. Our results revealed the downregulation and cleavage of vimentin 
which attenuates the malignant phenotype of the NB4 cells. Considering the 
favorable effect of this strategy in keeping down the malignant features of the 
leukemic cells, the effect of the iC9/AP1903 system in combination with 
all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment was evaluated. The obtained data prove 
that iC9/AP1903 significantly makes the leukemic cells more sensitive to ATRA.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

the composition, density, function, and distribution of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs), to influence differential therapeutic responses and 
prognosis in cancer patients. The clinical success of these agents, particularly 
anthracyclines like doxorubicin, not only depends on their cytotoxic activity 
but also by the enhancement of pre-existing immunity primarily through induction 
of immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, resistance for the induction of ICD 
either intrinsic or acquired is a major hurdle for most of these drugs. To 
enhance ICD by these agents, it has become clear that blockade of adenosine 
production or its signaling need to be specifically targeted as they represent 
highly resistant mechanisms. Given the prominent role of adenosine mediated 
immunosuppression and resistance to ICD induction in tumor microenvironment, 
combination strategies that involve ICD induction and adenosine signaling 
blockade are further warranted. In the present study, we investigated the 
antitumor effect of caffeine and doxorubicin combination therapy against 
3-MCA-induced and cell-line induced tumors in mice. Our results demonstrated 
significant tumor growth inhibition by the combination therapy of doxorubicin 
and caffeine against both carcinogen-induced and cell-line induced tumor models. 
In addition, significant T-cell infiltration and enhanced ICD induction 
evidenced by increased intratumoral calreticulin and HMGB1 levels, was observed 
in B16F10 melanoma mice. The possible mechanism behind the observed antitumor 
activity might be due to the enhanced ICD induction and subsequent T-cell 
infiltration by the combination therapy. To prevent the development of 
resistance and to enhance the antitumor activity of ICD inducing drugs like 
doxorubicin, combination with adenosine-A2A receptor pathway inhibitors like

the broken-down of self-tolerance. Autoimmune regulator (Aire), as a 
transcription factor, induces peripheral tolerance by regulating Toll-like 
receptor (TLR) expression in dendritic cells (DCs). Several studies have 
recently identified a small population of perforin-expressing DCs, which is an 
important population of tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) that restricts autoreactive T 
cells in vivo through a perforin-mediated mechanism. Thus, the present study 
explored the specific relationship among Aire, perforin-expressing DCs and 
immune tolerance, as well as their roles in type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: We conducted studies based on the Aire-overexpressing bone 
marrow-derived dendritic cell (BMDC) model. And through in vitro and in vivo 
experiments to observe that Aire-overexpressing BMDCs which express perforin 
induce immune tolerance and treat type 1 diabetes via TLR7/8.
RESULTS: Aire enhances the expression of perforin in BMDCs after treatment with 
the TLR7/8 ligand as well as promotes the expression of TLR7/8 and myeloid 
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway molecules. 
Aire-overexpressing BMDCs mediate apoptosis of allogeneic CD8+ T cells via 
perforin in vitro. Moreover, Aire-overexpressing BMDCs enhance the therapeutic 
effect of type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice via perforin and 
induce apoptosis of autoreactive CD8+ T cells in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an experimental basis for comprehensively 
elucidating the role and significance of Aire expression in peripheral DCs, 
thereby providing new ideas for the treatment of autoimmune diseases by using 
Aire as a target to induce the production of perforin-expressing DCs.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.109890

bioengineers in the past three decades. Different kinds of modelling considering 
various aspects of treatment have been proposed. In this paper, the key role of 
Regulatory T cells is discussed and a model in ordinary differential equation 
(ODE) form is proposed by adding this state to the system dynamics considering 
chemoimmunotherapy treatment. Regulatory T cells are considered as one of the 
main tumor cells' tactics to deceive the body's immune system. The improved 
model is verified mathematically and biologically and fits all criteria in both 
fields. The results show that entering Regulatory T cells state on cancer 
mathematical modelling for simulating body cells for chemoimmunotherapy provides 
a way to identify critical cases more carefully, which a simplified model is 
unable to accomplish. This point emphasizes the fact that this state must be 
present in cancer modelling to anticipate immune response more accurately. The 
advanced system fixed points are obtained by the Newton method and bifurcation 
diagrams are derived and discussed. New features and remarks are proposed during 
the journey of developing more accurate models that have the best fit with 
laboratory data. The sensitivity chart of the model is illustrated and novel 
aspects of discussions are made with the aim of personalizing a model for a

differentiate between patients with and without hydrocephalus. The admission 
characteristics of hydrocephalic patients with aneurysmal and nSAH were 
compared.
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 21 (30%) 
presented with hydrocephalus. In univariate logistic regression, leukocytes, 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte 
ratio, neutrophil-monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, and the systemic 
immune-inflammation (SII) index ([neutrophils × platelets/lymphocytes]/1000) 
were associated with hydrocephalus. After adjustments, the SII index 
independently predicted acute hydrocephalus with the highest odds among 
laboratory values (odds ratio 2.184, P = 0.006). Receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis revealed the SII index differentiated between 
patients with and without hydrocephalus (area under the curve = 0.799, 95% CI: 
0.688-0.909, P < 0.001) with an optimal cutoff of 1.385 103/μL. SII indices did 
not differ between aneurysmal and nSAH patients with hydrocephalus (3.5 vs. 3.6 
103/μL, P = 0.795).
CONCLUSIONS: A SII index ≥1.385 103/μL on admission predicts acute hydrocephalus 
in spontaneous nSAH. Hydrocephalic patients with aneurysmal and nSAH exhibit 
similar SII indices, and thus, an exaggerated inflammatory and thrombotic 
response follows spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage irrespective of hemorrhage

tightly associated with neuroinflammation. Pyroptosis is a form of 
pro-inflammatory and lytic cell death which has been observed in CNS diseases 
recently. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have exhibited immunoregulatory and 
protective effects in CNS diseases. However, the roles of Tregs in pyroptosis 
and their involvement in LPC-induced demyelination have not been explicated. In 
our study, Foxp3-diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) mice treated with diphtheria 
toxin (DT) or PBS were subjected to two-site lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 
injection. Immunofluorescence, western blot, Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining, 
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and neurobehavior assessments were 
performed to evaluate the severity of demyelination, neuroinflammation and 
pyroptosis. Pyroptosis inhibitor was further used to investigate the role of 
pyroptosis in LPC-induced demyelination. RNA-sequencing was applied to explore 
the potential regulatory mechanism underlying the involvement of Tregs in 
LPC-induced demyelination and pyroptosis. Our results showed that depletion of 
Tregs aggravated microgliosis, inflammatory responses, immune cells infiltration 
and led to exacerbated myelin injury as well as cognitive defects in LPC-induced 
demyelination. Microglial pyroptosis was observed after LPC-induced 
demyelination, which was aggravated by Tregs depletion. Inhibition of pyroptosis 
by VX765 reversed myelin injury and cognitive function exacerbated by Tregs 
depletion. RNA-sequencing showed TLR4/myeloid differentiation marker 88 (MyD88) 
as the central molecules in Tregs-pyroptosis pathway, and refraining 
TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway alleviated the aggravated pyroptosis induced by Tregs 
depletion. In conclusion, our findings for the first time indicate that Tregs 
alleviate myelin loss and improve cognitive function by inhibiting pyroptosis in

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The study aimed to explore the value of CT findings and inflammatory 
indicators in differentiating benign and malignant gallbladder polypoid lesions 
before surgery.
METHODS: The study comprised a total of 113 pathologically confirmed gallbladder 
polypoid lesions with a maximum diameter ≥ 1 cm (68 benign and 45 malignant), 
all of which were enhanced CT-scanned within 1 month before surgery. The CT 
findings and inflammatory indicators of the patients were analyzed by univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictors 
of gallbladder polypoid lesions, and then a nomogram distinguishing benign and 
malignant gallbladder polypoid lesions was developed by combining these 
characteristics. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision 
curve were plotted to assess the performance of the nomogram.
RESULTS: Base status of the lesion (p < 0.001), plain CT value (p < 0.001), 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p = 0.041), and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio 
(MLR) (p = 0.022) were independent predictors of malignant polypoid lesions of 
the gallbladder. The nomogram model established by incorporating the above 
factors had good performance in differentiating and predicting benign and 
malignant gallbladder polypoid lesions (AUC = 0.964), with sensitivity and 
specificity of 82.4% and 97.8%, respectively. The DCA demonstrated the important 
clinical utility of our nomogram.
CONCLUSION: CT findings combined with inflammatory indicators can effectively 
differentiate benign and malignant gallbladder polypoid lesions before surgery,

inhibits T cell receptor (TCR)-induced proliferation by altering intracellular 
sterol metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which LXR regulates helper T cell 
subset differentiation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that LXR is a 
crucial negative regulator of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells in vivo. Both 
mixed bone marrow chimera and antigen-specific T cell adoptive cotransfer 
studies show a specific increase in Tfh cells among LXRβ-deficient CD4+ T cell 
population in response to immunization and lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
mammarenavirus (LCMV) infection. Mechanistically, LXRβ-deficient Tfh cells 
express augmented levels of T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) but comparable levels of 
Bcl6, CXCR5, and PD-1 in comparison with those of LXRβ-sufficient Tfh cells. 
Loss of LXRβ confers inactivation of GSK3β induced by either AKT/Extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation or Wnt/β-catenin pathway, leading to 
elevated TCF-1 expression in CD4+ T cells. Conversely, ligation of LXR represses 
TCF-1 expression and Tfh cell differentiation in both murine and human CD4+ 
T cells. LXR agonist significantly diminishes Tfh cells and the levels of 
antigen-specific IgG upon immunization. These findings unveil a cell-intrinsic 
regulatory function of LXR in Tfh cell differentiation via the GSK3β-TCF1 
pathway, which may serve as a promising target for pharmacological intervention 
in Tfh-mediated diseases.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2213793120

study was to evaluate the impact of different bacterial infection on sepsis 
based on human samples and cellular experiments. Physiological indexes and 
prognostic information of 121 sepsis patients were analysed based on whether 
they had a gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial infection. Moreover, murine 
RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or peptidoglycan 
(PG) to simulate infection with gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria in 
sepsis, respectively. Exosomes derived from the macrophages were extracted for 
transcriptome sequencing. In patients with sepsis, most gram-positive bacterial 
infections were Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative infections were 
Escherichia coli. Gram-negative bacterial infection was significantly associated 
with high neutrophil and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in blood and shorter 
prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Intriguingly, 
the survival prognosis of sepsis patients was not affected by the type of 
bacterial infection, but it was significantly related to fibrinogen. Protein 
transcriptome sequencing of the macrophage-derived exosomes showed that 
differentially expressed proteins were significantly enriched in megakaryocyte 
differentiation, leukocyte and lymphocyte-mediated immunity, and complement and 
coagulation cascade pathways. The complement and coagulation-related proteins 
were significantly upregulated after LPS induction, which explained the 
shortened PT and APTT in gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Bacterial infection did 
not affect mortality in sepsis but did alter the host response. The immune 
disorder induced by gram-negative infection was more severe than that produced

antigens found on the surface of Red Blood Cells (RBC), vasculature endothelial 
cells, alveolar epithelial cells, collecting tubules of the kidney, and on the 
surface of Purkinje cells in the brain, but are absent on the adult liver. Duffy 
antigens are absent on platelets, lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes.  
Duffy antigens act as receptors for chemokines and attract immune system cells. 
Duffy antigens also act as receptors for the Plasmodium species responsible for 
malaria. Antibodies against the Duffy blood group antigens are implicated in 
hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR) and hemolytic disease of the fetus and 
newborn (HDFN). Duffy blood group system International Society of Blood 
Transfusion (ISBT) symbol: FY ISBT Number: 008 History Duffy blood group antigen 
(Fy) was first discovered in 1950 in a patient named Duffy with multiple 
transfusions who presented with hemolytic transfusion reactions by Cutbush 
et al. Duffy glycoprotein or CD234 (Cluster of Differentiation 234) is a 
multi-pass protein. It spans the RBC membrane seven times with an exocellular N- 
terminal and an endocellular C-terminal, while multi-pass proteins in the other 
blood group system, both N and C terminals, are endocellular.  The Duffy 
antigens, FYa and FYb, are the gene products of DARC (Duffy antigen chemokine 
receptor; AKA ACKR1, atypical chemokine receptor 1).  Genetics Atypical 
Chemokine Receptor 1 (ACKR1) gene encodes the glycoprotein expressing the Duffy 
blood group antigens, or CD234 protein (Cluster of Differentiation 234 protein) 
and is encoded by a gene located at 1q23.2 position on the long arm of 
chromosome 1. This ACKR1 gene produces two mRNA variants and yields two protein 
isoforms with 338 and 336 amino acids. The Duffy antigens, i.e., Fya and Fyb, 
are encoded by FYA and FYB codominant alleles, respectively, which differ at 
position 125, where guanine in Fy-a is replaced by adenosine in Fy-b, which 
changes the glycine amino acid to aspartic amino acid at position 42 in Duffy 
glycoprotein.  Duffy antigens gene locus is syntenic to the gene locus for Rh 
antigen gene locus at chromosome 1. In most Duffy negative individuals, a silent 
Fy-b allele with T to C substitution near the gene transcription initiation site 
at nucleotide-46 is present. It impairs the promoter activity in human erythroid 
cells by disrupting the binding site for the erythroid transcription factor, 
i.e., GATA1. Still, the same gene is transcribed in the nonerythroid cells due 
to substitution mutation.  ACKRs receptors do not couple with G-proteins as its 
structure Asp-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Ala-Ile-Val (DRYLAIV) motif is absent on the second 
intracellular loop, leading to no GPCR dependant signaling pathways and 
chemotaxis. However, they function as scavenge, transport, and regulator of the 
bioavailability of chemokines. Antigens A total of five antigens are present in 
the Duffy blood group system: Fya, Fyb, Fy3, Fy5, and Fy6. Fya Antigen: ISBT 
symbol: FY1. ISBT number: 008.001. Antithetical antigen: Fyb (FY2). The 
expression on the cord blood RBCs: Expressed. The antigen can be demonstrated on 
the fetal RBCs as early as six weeks gestation. The adult level of Fya 
expression is attained approximately 12 weeks after birth. Fya antigens are 
sensitive to ficin, papain, and α-chymotrypsin and resistant to trypsin. Fyb 
Antigen: ISBT symbol: FY2. ISBT number: 008.002. Antithetical antigen: Fy(FY1). 
Expression on the cord blood RBCs: Expressed. Effect of enzymes: Fyb antigens 
are sensitive to ficin, papain, and α-chymotrypsin and resistant to trypsin. . 
Fy3 Antigen: ISBT symbol: FY3. ISBT number: 008003. Expression on the cord blood 
RBCs: Expressed and increases with age. Effect of enzymes: Fy3 antigens are 
resistant to ficin, papain, trypsin, and α-chymotrypsin. Fy5 Antigen: ISBT 
symbol: FY5. ISBT number: 008005. The expression on the cord blood RBCs: 
Expressed. Weak antigenic expression on D negative RBCs and absence in Rh null 
phenotype red cells show possible interaction between Duffy and Rh proteins. 
Effect of enzymes: Fy5 antigens are resistant to ficin and papain. Fy6 Antigen: 
ISBT symbol: FY6. ISBT number: 008.006. The expression on the cord blood RBCs. 
Effect of enzymes: Fy6 antigens are sensitive to ficin, papain, and 
α-chymotrypsin and resistant to trypsin. Epitopes of Fy6 antigen are required 
for invasion of P. vivax. Only murine monoclonal antibodies have defined this 
antigen, not human antibodies. Note: Fy4 antigen is obsolete in this system due 
to no evidence of antibodies against this antigen. Duffy Antibodies: Antibodies 
in the Duffy blood group system are mainly IgG type, and IgM type is rare. Duffy 
antibodies generally do not bind to complement, but some anti-Fyantibodies have 
been reported to bind with complement. These antibodies are not naturally 
occurring and are acquired by exposure to blood transfusion, pregnancy, and 
transplantation. Fya antibody is most common among other Duffy antibodies. The 
majority of Duffy antibodies show their reactivity at body temperature; hence 
they may cause red hemolysis and are clinically significant. These clinically 
significant antibodies can lead to both acute and delayed types of HTR and 
hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Dosage phenomena: Duffy blood 
group system shows dosage phenomena where Duffy antibodies react more strongly 
to homozygous cells {Fy(a−b+) or Fy(a+b−)} than heterozygous {Fy(a+b+)}. Duffy 
Phenotypes Four major Duffy phenotypes: - Fy(a+b-), Fy(a+b+), Fy(a-b+), 
Fy(a-b-): The Fya and Fyb antigens are found commonly in Europeans (Fya 66% and 
Fyb 83%) and Asians (Fya 99% and Fyb18.5%), while less common in Africans (Fya 
10% and Fyb 23%). Further, Fy(a-b-) phenotype in African origins is found in 
two-thirds of populations and rare in Europeans. Major antigenic frequencies are 
shown in Table 1. Additionally, a minor Duffy phenotype is the Fyx or [Fy(b+x)]. 
In this phenotype, the antigen is weakly expressed as Fyb and is determined by 
serological adsorption and elution techniques and DNA sequencing. FYX allele 
encodes weakly expressed Fyb antigen, which sometimes may not be detected by 
anti-Fy. The Fy(a–b–) phenotype, most commonly found in Blacks, occurs primarily 
due to a GATA promoter region mutation upstream of the FY allele. This mutation 
prevents the expression of Duffy glycoprotein on erythrocytes only while 
permitting expression on nonerythroid cells. Table 1 Major antigenic frequencies

general medical practice. Patients and physicians have varying degrees of 
associated anxiety with the finding of lymphadenopathy as a small number of 
cases can be caused by neoplasm or infections of consequence, for example, HIV 
or tuberculosis (TB). However, it is generally recognized that most 
lymphadenopathy, both localized and generalized, is of benign, self-limited 
etiology. A clear understanding of lymph node function, location, description, 
and the etiologies of their enlargement is important in the clinical decisions 
of which cases need rapid and aggressive workup and which need only be observed. 
The lymph node functions as an antigen filter for the reticuloendothelial (RE) 
system of the body. It consists of a multi-layered sinus that sequentially 
exposes B-cell lymphocytes, T-cell lymphocytes, and macrophages to an afferent 
extracellular fluid. In this way, the immune system can recognize and react to 
foreign proteins and mount an immune response or sequester these proteins as 
appropriate. In this reaction, there is some multiplication of the responding 
resistant cell line, and thus, the node itself increases in size. It is 
generally held that a node size is considered enlarged when it is more 
significant than 1 cm. However, the reality is that ""normal"" and ""enlarged"" 
criteria vary depending on the location of the node and the age of the patient. 
For example, children younger than ten have more hypertrophic immune systems, 
and nodes up to 2 cm can be considered normal in some clinical situations. 
However, an epitrochlear node of above 0.5 cm is deemed to be pathological in an 
adult. The pattern, distribution, and quality of the lymphadenopathy can provide 
much clinical information in the diagnostic process. Lymphadenopathy occurs in 2 
patterns: generalized and localized. Generalized lymphadenopathy entails 
lymphadenopathy in 2 or more non-contiguous locations. Localized adenopathy 
occurs in contiguous groupings of lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are distributed in 
discrete anatomical areas, and their enlargement reflects the lymphatic drainage 
of their location. The nodes themselves may be tender or non-tender, fixed or 
mobile, discreet or ""matted"" together. Concomitant symptomatology and the 
epidemiology of the patient and the illness provide further diagnostic cues. A 
thorough history of any prodromal illness, fever, chills, night sweats, weight 
loss, and localizing symptoms can be very revealing. Additionally, the 
demographic particulars of the patient, including age, gender, exposure to 
infectious disease, toxins, medications, and their habits, may provide further 
cues. As evidenced above, the critical step in evaluation for adenopathy is a 
careful history and focused physical exam. The extent of the history and 
physical is determined by the clinical presentation of the patient. For example, 
a patient with posterior cervical adenopathy, sore throat, and tremendous 
fatigue need only a careful history, cursory examination, and a mono test. In 
contrast, a person with generalized lymphadenopathy and fatigue would require 
more extensive investigation. Generally, the majority of the lymphadenopathy is 
localized (some site a 3:1 ratio), with the majority of that being represented 
in the head and neck region (again, some site a 3:1 ratio). It also is accepted 
that all generalized lymphadenopathy merits clinical evaluation, and the 
presence of ""matted lymphadenopathy"" is strongly indicative of significant 
pathology.Examination of the patient's history, physical examination, and the 
demographic in which they fall can allow the patient to be placed into 1 of 
several different accepted algorithms for workup of lymphadenopathy. The use of 
these cues and selection of the correct arm of the algorithm allows for a fairly 
rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of lymphadenopathy, including 
determination when it is safe to observe. Algorithmic Analysis of 
Lymphadenopathy After a history and physical examination are completed, 
lymphadenopathy is placed into 3 categories: : 1. ""Diagnostic"" such as strep 
pharyngitis or upper respiratory tract disease, in which case the course of 
action is to treat the condition. 2. ""Suggestive"" such as mononucleosis lymphoma 
or HIV wherein the history and physical strongly suggestive diagnosis-specific 
testing is performed and if positive the action is to treat the condition. 3. 
""Unexplained"" where the lymphadenopathy is divided into generalized 
lymphadenopathy and localized lymphadenopathy: For unexplained localized 
lymphadenopathy, a review of history, a regional exam, and epidemiological 
clues are used to separate patients into lower (no risk of malignancy or serious 
disease) versus higher risk for serious disease or malignancy categories. If the 
patient is at no risk for malignancy or serious illness, the reasonable course 
is to observe the patient for 3 to 4 weeks to see if the lymphadenopathy 
resolves or improves. In which case, the clinician is safely cleared to follow 
the patient. If the lymphadenopathy does not resolve or improve, the next step 
is to obtain a biopsy. If the patient is judged to have a risk for malignancy or 
serious illness, the procedure is to proceed immediately to biopsy. For 
unexplained generalized lymphadenopathy, the key to diagnosis is a history to 
evaluate for suspected causes. The initial search would be questioning for a 
mononucleosis-type syndrome evidenced by fever atypical lymphocytosis and 
malaise included in these differentials would be Epstein-Barr virus, 
cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and (especially in the case of a flu-like 
illness and her rash) the initial stages of an HIV infection. The second step in 
evaluating unexplained generalized lymphadenopathy involves a careful review of 
epidemiological cues. Included in the epidemiological cues would be: : 1. 
Infectious disease exposure. 2. Animal exposure. 3. Insect bites. 4. Recent 
travel. 5. Complete medication history. 6. Personal habits-smoking, consumption 
of alcohol, consumption of drugs-special attention to a history of IVTA, 
high-risk sexual behavior. 7. Consumption of under-cooked food/untreated water. 
Although there is no ""cookbook"" for the laboratory evaluation of generalized 
unexplained lymphadenopathy, the initial steps are to obtain a complete blood 
count (CBC) with a manual differential and EBV serology. If non-diagnostic, the 
next steps would be PPD placement, RPR, chest x-ray, ANA, hepatitis B surface 
antigen, and HIV test. Again if any of the above are positive, appropriate 
treatment can be initiated. In the presence of negative serological examinations 
and radiological examinations, and or significant symptomology, a biopsy of the 
abnormal node is the gold standard for diagnosis.Statistics concerning 
lymphadenopathy are not accurate as the great majority of lymphadenopathy is 
caused by a non-reportable illness and thus not reported or taken into 
account. This results in a statistical bias, or skew, toward the reportable 
causes of lymphadenopathy:  malignancies, HIV, tuberculosis, and sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs). Citations in the recent literature for general 
medical practice indicate that less than 1% of people with lymphadenopathy have 
malignant disease most often due to leukemia and younger children Hodgkin 
disease in adolescence non-Hodgkin disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL) in adults. It has been reported the general prevalence of malignancy is 
0.4% in patients under 40 years and around 4% in those older than 40 years of 
age seen in a primary care setting. It is reported that the prevalence rate of 
neoplastic disease rises to near 20% in referral centers and rises to 50% or 
more in patients with initial risk factors.","Copyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",PMID: 30020622

selected for reentry or differentiation. As the products from GCs, memory B 
cells and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) support high-affinity and long-lasting 
immunity. Positive selection of BGC cells is controlled by signals received 
through the B cell receptor (BCR) and follicular helper T (TFH) cell-derived 
signals, in particular costimulation through CD40. Here, we demonstrate that the 
TFH cell effector cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) joins BCR and CD40 in 
supporting BGC selection and reveal that strong IL-21 signaling prioritizes ASC 
differentiation in vivo. BGC cells, compared with non-BGC cells, show 
significantly reduced IL-21 binding and attenuated signaling, which is mediated 
by low cellular heparan sulfate (HS) sulfation. Mechanistically, N-deacetylase 
and N-sulfotransferase 1 (Ndst1)-mediated N-sulfation of HS in B cells promotes 
IL-21 binding and signal strength. Ndst1 is down-regulated in BGC cells and 
up-regulated in ASC precursors, suggesting selective desensitization to IL-21 in 
BGC cells. Thus, specialized biochemical regulation of IL-21 bioavailability and 
signal strength sets a balance between the stringency and efficiency of GC 
selection.","DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.add1728

in humoral immune responses.
BACKGROUND: The γδ T cell receptor (γδ TCR) recognizes antigens, including 
haptens and proteins, in an MHC-independent manner. The recognition of these 
antigens by γδ TCRs crosses antigen recognition by the B cell receptors (BCRs), 
suggesting that γδ T cells may be involved in the process of antigen recognition 
and activation of B cells. However, the role of γδ T cells in humoral immune 
responses is still less clear.
METHODS: The kinds of literature about the γδ T cell-B cell interaction were 
searched on PubMed with search terms, such as γδ T cells, antibody, B cell 
responses, antigen recognition, and infection.
RESULTS: Accumulating evidence indicates that γδ T cells, independent of αβ T 
cells, participate in multiple steps of humoral immunity, including B cell 
maturation, activation and differentiation, antibody production and class 
switching. Mechanically, γδ T cells affect B cell function by directly 
interacting with B cells, secreting cytokines, or modulating αβ T cells.
CONCLUSION: In this review, we summarize current knowledge on how γδ T cells 
take part in the humoral immune response, which may assist future vaccine 
design.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland

immunodeficiency (X‑SCID) patients caused by pathogenic mutations in IL2GR. 
However, the functional status of the engrafted cells remains unclear because of 
the difficulty in separately evaluating the function of the maternal and 
autologous cells. The present study reported an X‑SCID patient with a de novo 
c.677C>T (p.R226H) variant in exon 5 of IL2RG, exhibiting recurrent and 
persistent infections from 3‑months‑old. After the male patient suffering 
recurrent pneumonia and acute hematogenous disseminated tuberculosis when 
13‑months‑old, single‑cell RNA sequencing was applied to characterize the 
transcriptome landscape of his bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs). A novel 
bioinformatic analysis strategy was designed to discriminate maternal and 
autologous cells at single‑cell resolution. The maternal engrafted cells 
consisted primarily of T, NKT and NK cells and the patient presented with the 
coexistence of autologous cells of these cell types. When compared respectively 
with normal counterparts, both maternal and autologous T and NKT cells increased 
the transcription of some important cytokines (GZMB, PRF1 and NKG7) against 
infections, but decreased the expression of a number of key transcription 
factors (FOS, JUN, TCF7 and LEF1) related to lymphocyte activation, 
proliferation and differentiation. Notably, the expression of multiple 
inhibitory factors (LAG3, CTLA4 and HAVCR2) were substantially enhanced in the T 
and NKT cells of both origins. In conclusion, both maternal and autologous T and

is only partially determined. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 
different RT strategies on peripheral B, T, and Natural killer (NK) lymphocytes 
at precise longitudinal time-points in PCa. 18 patients treated with 
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (40 Gy/3FRX), definitive 
moderate-hypofractionation (62 Gy/20FRX), or post-operative 
conventional-fractionation RT (66-69 Gy/30FRX) were prospectively evaluated for 
the immune cell profile in terms of immune cell composition, differentiation 
stage, cytokine production and inhibitory receptor (IR) expression. The 
immune-monitoring of the 18 patients revealed that RT affects the balance of 
systemic immune cells, with the main differences observed between SBRT and 
conventionally fractionated RT. SBRT favorably impacts immune response in term 
of increased B cells, central-memory and effector-memory CD8+ T cells, along 
with decreased Treg cells after treatment. On the contrary, conventional 
fractionated RT had a long-term negative effect on the systemic immune profile, 
including a decrease of total lymphocyte counts accompanied by an increase of 
neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio. Total B and T cells decreased and Treg-to-CD8+ 
ratio increased. Functionality of T lymphocytes were not affected by any of the 
3-fractionation schedules. Interestingly, SBRT significantly up-regulates the 
expression of V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) in 
CD8+ T cells in the absence of other IRs. Our results indicate the relevance of 
systematic immunomonitoring during RT to identify novel immune-related target to 
design trials of combined radio-immunotherapy as a promising strategy in the 
clinical management of PCa.","© 2023 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2023.2174721

epithelial tumor cells and the proportion of lymphocytes. Type A thymomas are 
composed of the spindle or oval tumor epithelial cells. Tumor cells of B 
thymomas are epithelioid-shaped with increasing atypia. Type AB thymomas have 
the features of epithelial tumor cells of A and B thymomas. The diagnosis can be 
difficult because of the complex morphology. Some novel thymic epithelial 
markers have been reported in several preclinical studies, but they have not 
been applied to clinical practice. Here, we investigated the expression of 3 
cortical and 3 medullary markers, which are thymoproteasome-specific subunit β5t 
(β5t), thymus-specific serine protease 16 (PRSS16), cathepsin V, autoimmune 
regulator (AIRE), CD40 and claudin-4.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 53 cases of thymomas and 
thymic squamous cell carcinomas (TSCC), aiming to explore the expression of 
cortical and medullary epithelial markers and their correlation with 
histological classification, Masaoka-Koga stage, and prognosis.
RESULTS: Our results found that for cortical epithelial markers the expression 
of β5t, PRSS16, and cathepsin V was higher in type AB and B thymomas than in 
micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma (MNT), and we observed a dramatic 
increase of β5t and PRSS16 expression in type AB compared to type A thymomas. In 
medullary epithelial markers, the expression of AIRE was higher in type A than 
in B3 thymomas. CD40 and β5t expression were associated with the Masaoka-Koga 
stage. High cathepsin V expression was related to a good prognosis and a longer 
progression-free survival.
CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive analysis of the role of thymic 
cortical and medullary epithelial markers as biomarkers for differential 
diagnosis and prognosis in thymic tumors. Thymic medullary epithelial 
immunophenotype was found to exhibit in type A, MNT, and TSCC. Type B thymomas 
primarily exhibited a cortical epithelial immunophenotype. Type AB thymomas 
showed cortical, medullary, or mixed corticomedullary epithelial 
immunophenotype. Our results demonstrated that thymic cortical and medullary 
epithelial markers including β5t, PRSS16, cathepsin V, and AIRE could be used as 
ancillary markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of thymic epithelial tumors.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-10619-6

    Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2023 May 1;207(9):1114-1115.","Rationale: Remodeling and loss of distal conducting airways, including 
preterminal and terminal bronchioles (pre-TBs/TBs), underlie progressive airflow 
limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The cellular basis 
of these structural changes remains unknown. Objectives: To identify biological 
changes in pre-TBs/TBs in COPD at single-cell resolution and determine their 
cellular origin. Methods: We established a novel method of distal airway 
dissection and performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of 111,412 cells 
isolated from different airway regions of 12 healthy lung donors and pre-TBs of 
5 patients with COPD. Imaging CyTOF and immunofluorescence analysis of 
pre-TBs/TBs from 24 healthy lung donors and 11 subjects with COPD were performed 
to characterize cellular phenotypes at a tissue level. Region-specific 
differentiation of basal cells isolated from proximal and distal airways was 
studied using an air-liquid interface model. Measurements and Main Results: The 
atlas of cellular heterogeneity along the proximal-distal axis of the human lung 
was assembled and identified region-specific cellular states, including SCGB3A2+ 
SFTPB+ terminal airway-enriched secretory cells (TASCs) unique to distal 
airways. TASCs were lost in COPD pre-TBs/TBs, paralleled by loss of 
region-specific endothelial capillary cells, increased frequency of CD8+ T cells 
normally enriched in proximal airways, and augmented IFN-γ signaling. Basal 
cells residing in pre-TBs/TBs were identified as a cellular origin of TASCs. 
Regeneration of TASCs by these progenitors was suppressed by IFN-γ. Conclusions: 
Altered maintenance of the unique cellular organization of pre-TBs/TBs, 
including loss of the region-specific epithelial differentiation in these 
bronchioles, represents the cellular manifestation and likely the cellular basis 
of distal airway remodeling in COPD.","DOI: 10.1164/rccm.202207-1384OC

of new treatment alternatives. Comprehensive economic reviews in the field of 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are warranted to supplement the existing 
analyses focused on specific therapeutic areas.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted based on literature 
searches in Medline and EMBASE to summarize the published health economics 
models related to all types of CLL therapies. Narrative synthesis of relevant 
studies was performed focusing on compared treatments, patient populations, 
modelling approaches and key findings.
RESULTS: We included 29 studies, the majority of which were published between 
2016 and 2018, when data from large clinical trials in CLL became available. 
Treatment regimens were compared in 25 cases, while the remaining four studies 
considered treatment strategies with more complex patient pathways. Based on the 
review results, Markov modelling with a simple structure of three health states 
(progression-free, progressed, death) can be considered as the traditional basis 
to simulate cost effectiveness. However, more recent studies added further 
complexity, including additional health states for different therapies (e.g. 
best supportive care or stem cell transplantation), for progression-free state 
(e.g. by differentiating between with or without treatment), or for response 
status (i.e. partial response and complete response).
CONCLUSIONS: As personalized medicine is increasingly gaining recognition, we 
expect that future economic evaluations will also incorporate new solutions, 
which are necessary to capture a larger number of genetic and molecular markers 
and more complex patient pathways with individual patient-level allocation of 
treatment options and thus economic assessments.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s40259-023-00583-9

Sciences, Ithaca, New York, USA.
(2)University of Washington, Department of Immunology, Seattle, Washington, USA.","BACKGROUND: Infiltration of cluster of differentiation (CD) 3+ (CD3+) T cells 
into the synovium and synovial fluid occurs in most patients with posttraumatic 
osteoarthritis. During disease progression, proinflammatory T helper 17 cells 
and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells infiltrate the joint in response to 
inflammation. This study aimed to characterize the dynamics of regulatory T and 
T helper 17 cell populations in synovial fluid from equine clinical patients 
with posttraumatic osteoarthritis to determine whether phenotype and function 
are associated with potential immunotherapeutic targets.
HYPOTHESIS: An imbalance of the ratio of regulatory T cells and T helper 17 
cells would be associated with disease progression in posttraumatic 
osteoarthritis, suggesting opportunities for immunomodulatory therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study.
METHODS: Synovial fluid was aspirated from the joints of equine clinical 
patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery for posttraumatic osteoarthritis 
resulting from intra-articular fragmentation. Joints were classified as having 
mild or moderate posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Synovial fluid was also obtained 
from nonoperated horses with normal cartilage. Peripheral blood was obtained 
from horses with normal cartilage and those with mild and moderate posttraumatic 
osteoarthritis. Synovial fluid and peripheral blood cells were analyzed by flow 
cytometry, and native synovial fluid was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay.
RESULTS: CD3+ T cells represented 81% of lymphocytes in synovial fluid, which 
increased in animals with moderate posttraumatic osteoarthritis to 88.3% (P = 
.02). CD14+ macrophages were doubled in those with moderate posttraumatic 
osteoarthritis compared with mild posttraumatic osteoarthritis and controls (P < 
.001). Less than 5% of CD3+ T cells found within the joint were forkhead box P3 
protein+ (Foxp3+) regulatory T cells, but a 4- to 8-times higher percentage of 
nonoperated and mild posttraumatic osteoarthritis joint regulatory T cells 
secreted interleukin (IL)-10 than peripheral blood Tregs (P < .005). T 
regulatory-1 cells that secreted IL-10 but did not express Foxp3 accounted for 
approximately 5% of CD3+ T cells in all joints. T helper 17 cells and Th17-like 
regulatory T cells were increased in those with moderate posttraumatic 
osteoarthritis (P < .0001) compared with mild and nonoperated patients. IL-10, 
IL-17A, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 2 (CCL2), and CCL5 
concentrations detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in synovial fluid 
were not different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: An imbalance of the ratio of regulatory T cells and T helper 17 
cells and an increase in T helper 17 cell-like regulatory T cells in synovial 
fluid from joints with more severe disease provide novel insights into 
immunological mechanisms that are associated with posttraumatic osteoarthritis 
progression and pathogenesis.

mitigation of posttraumatic osteoarthritis may improve patient clinical 
outcomes.","DOI: 10.1177/03635465231153588

cell differentiation. Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F. H. Chen (Araliaceae) saponins 
(PNS) have an anti-inflammatory effect and can suppress Th17 cell 
differentiation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate mechanisms of PNS on Th17 cell differentiation in RA, 
and the role of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Naive CD4+T cells were treated with IL-6, IL-23 and TGF-β 
to induce Th17 cell differentiation. Apart from the Control group, other cells 
were treated with PNS (5, 10, 20 μg/mL). After the treatment, Th17 cell 
differentiation, PKM2 expression, and STAT3 phosphorylation were measured via 
flow cytometry, western blots, or immunofluorescence. PKM2-specific allosteric 
activator (Tepp-46, 50, 100, 150 μM) and inhibitor (SAICAR, 2, 4, 8 μM) were 
used to verify the mechanisms. A CIA mouse model was established and divided 
into control, model, and PNS (100 mg/kg) groups to assess an anti-arthritis 
effect, Th17 cell differentiation, and PKM2/STAT3 expression.
RESULTS: PKM2 expression, dimerization, and nuclear accumulation were 
upregulated upon Th17 cell differentiation. PNS inhibited the Th17 cells, RORγt 
expression, IL-17A levels, PKM2 dimerization, and nuclear accumulation and 
Y705-STAT3 phosphorylation in Th17 cells. Using Tepp-46 (100 μM) and SAICAR 
(4 μM), we demonstrated that PNS (10 μg/mL) inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and 
Th17 cell differentiation by suppressing nuclear PKM2 accumulation. In CIA mice, 
PNS attenuated CIA symptoms, reduced the number of splenic Th17 cells and 
nuclear PKM2/STAT3 signaling.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: PNS inhibited Th17 cell differentiation through the 
inhibition of nuclear PKM2-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation. PNS may be useful for 
treating RA.","DOI: 10.1080/13880209.2023.2173248

underlying pathology of myocardial infarction and stroke. The pathogenesis is 
age-dependent, but the links between disease progression, age, and atherogenic 
cytokines and chemokines are incompletely understood. Here, we studied the 
chemokine-like inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor 
(MIF) in atherogenic Apoe-/- mice across different stages of aging and 
cholesterol-rich high-fat diet (HFD). MIF promotes atherosclerosis by mediating 
leukocyte recruitment, lesional inflammation, and suppressing atheroprotective B 
cells. However, links between MIF and advanced atherosclerosis across aging have 
not been systematically explored. We compared effects of global Mif-gene 
deficiency in 30-, 42-, and 48-week-old Apoe-/- mice on HFD for 24, 36, or 
42 weeks, respectively, and in 52-week-old mice on a 6-week HFD. Mif-deficient 
mice exhibited reduced atherosclerotic lesions in the 30/24- and 42/36-week-old 
groups, but atheroprotection, which in the applied Apoe-/- model was limited to 
lesions in the brachiocephalic artery and abdominal aorta, was not detected in 
the 48/42- and 52/6-week-old groups. This suggested that atheroprotection 
afforded by global Mif-gene deletion differs across aging stages and atherogenic 
diet duration. To characterize this phenotype and study the underlying 
mechanisms, we determined immune cells in the periphery and vascular lesions, 
obtained a multiplex cytokine/chemokine profile, and compared the transcriptome 
between the age-related phenotypes. We found that Mif deficiency promotes 
lesional macrophage and T-cell counts in younger but not aged mice, with 
subgroup analysis pointing toward a role for Trem2+ macrophages. The 
transcriptomic analysis identified pronounced MIF- and aging-dependent changes 
in pathways predominantly related to lipid synthesis and metabolism, lipid 
storage, and brown fat cell differentiation, as well as immunity, and 
atherosclerosis-relevant enriched genes such as Plin1, Ldlr, Cpne7, or Il34, 
hinting toward effects on lesional lipids, foamy macrophages, and immune cells. 
Moreover, Mif-deficient aged mice exhibited a distinct plasma cytokine/chemokine 
signature consistent with the notion that mediators known to drive inflamm'aging 
are either not downregulated or even upregulated in Mif-deficient aged mice 
compared with the corresponding younger ones. Lastly, Mif deficiency favored 
formation of lymphocyte-rich peri-adventitial leukocyte clusters. While the 
causative contributions of these mechanistic pillars and their interplay will be 
subject to future scrutiny, our study suggests that atheroprotection due to 
global Mif-gene deficiency in atherogenic Apoe-/- mice is reduced upon advanced 
aging and identifies previously unrecognized cellular and molecular targets that 
could explain this phenotype shift. These observations enhance our understanding 
of inflamm'aging and MIF pathways in atherosclerosis and may have implications 
for translational MIF-directed strategies.","© 2023 The Authors. The FASEB Journal published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on

injured brain recovery after ischemic stroke. However, few effective methods are 
currently used for equilibrating immune balance. CD3+NK1.1-TCRβ+CD4-CD8- 
double-negative T (DNT) cells which do not express NK cell surface markers are 
unique regulatory cells that maintain homeostasis in several immune-related 
diseases. However, the therapeutic potential and regulatory mechanism of DNT 
cells in ischemic stroke are still unknown. Methods: Mouse ischemic stroke is 
induced by occlusion of the distal branches of the middle cerebral artery 
(dMCAO). DNT cells were adoptively transferred intravenously into ischemic 
stroke mice. Neural recovery was evaluated by TTC staining and behavioral 
analysis. Using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing, the 
immune regulatory function of DNT cells was investigated at different time 
points post ischemic stroke. Results: Adoptive transfer of DNT cells 
significantly reduces infarct volume and improves sensorimotor function after 
ischemic stroke. DNT cells suppress peripheral Trem1+ myeloid cell 
differentiation during the acute phase. Furthermore, they infiltrate the 
ischemic tissue via CCR5 and equilibrate the local immune balance during the 
subacute phase. During the chronic phase, DNT cells enhance Treg cell 
recruitment through CCL5, eventually developing an immune homeostatic milieu for 
neuronal recovery. Conclusions: DNT cell treatment renders the comprehensive 
anti-inflammatory roles in specific phases of ischemic stroke. Our study 
suggests that the adoptive transfer of regulatory DNT cells may be a potential 
cell-based therapy for ischemic stroke.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/thno.80307

neoplasm with a relatively favorable prognosis. As PXA histologically presents 
with large, multinucleated neoplastic cells, its principal differential 
diagnosis is giant cell glioblastoma (GCGBM). While there is a significant 
overlap between the two histologically and the neuropathological diagnosis can 
be challenging, as well as having some overlap neuroradiologically, the patient 
prognosis differs significantly, with PXA having a more favorable one. Herein we 
present a case report of a male patient in his thirties diagnosed with GCGBM and 
presenting again six years later with thickening of the wall of the 
porencephalic cyst suggestive of disease recurrence. Histopathology revealed 
neoplastic spindle, small lymphocyte-like, large epithelioid-like, some with 
foamy cytoplasm, and scattered large multinucleated cells with bizarre nuclei. 
For the most part, the tumor had a distinct border to the surrounding brain 
parenchyma, except for a single zone of invasion. As per the depicted 
morphology, with a lack of pathognomic features of GCGBM, the diagnosis of PXA 
was defined, and the oncologic committee reevaluated the patient with treatment 
reinitiation. Based on the close morphological profile of these neoplasias, it 
is likely that in the case of limited material, multiple PXA cases are diagnosed 
as GCGBM, resulting in misdiagnosed long survivors.","Copyright © 2023, Stoyanov et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.33735

Childhood Asthma Management Program (n=610) and the Genetic Epidemiology of 
Asthma in Costa Rica Study (n=326); we then reversed the discovery and 
replication cohorts, which revealed 59 significant genes that replicated in both 
directions. Gene ontology analysis revealed that many of these genes were 
implicated in immune function pathways, including defense response, inflammatory 
response, and cytokine production. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis 
revealed four genes (CLC, CCDC21, S100A13, and GCNT1) as putatively causal 
(p<0.05) regulators of IgE levels. GCNT1 (beta=1.5, p=0.01)-which is a top 
result in the MR analysis of expression in relation to asthma and allergic 
diseases-plays a role in regulating T helper type 1 cell homing, lymphocyte 
trafficking, and B cell differentiation. Our findings build upon prior knowledge 
of IgE regulation and provide a deeper understanding of underlying molecular 
mechanisms. The IgE-associated genes that we identified-particularly those 
implicated in MR analysis-can be explored as promising therapeutic targets for 
asthma and IgE-related diseases.","Copyright © 2023 Recto, Huan, Lee, Lee, Gereige, Yao, Hwang, Joehanes, Kelly,

disabling muscle weaknesses due to anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 
autoantibodies. To gain insight into immune dysregulation underlying early-onset 
AChR+ MG, we performed an in-depth analysis of peripheral mononuclear blood 
cells (PBMCs) using mass cytometry. PBMCs from 24 AChR+ MG patients without 
thymoma and 16 controls were stained with a panel of 37 antibodies. Using both 
unsupervised and supervised approaches, we observed a decrease in monocytes, for 
all subpopulations: classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes. In 
contrast, an increase in innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2s) and CD27- γδ T cells 
was observed. We further investigated the dysregulations affecting monocytes and 
γδ T cells in MG. We analyzed CD27- γδ T cells in PBMCs and thymic cells from 
AChR+ MG patients. We detected the increase in CD27- γδ T cells in thymic cells 
of MG patients suggesting that the inflammatory thymic environment might affect 
γδ T cell differentiation. To better understand changes that might affect 
monocytes, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from CD14+ PBMCs and showed a global 
decrease activity of monocytes in MG patients. Next, by flow cytometry, we 
especially confirmed the decrease affecting non-classical monocytes. In MG, as 
for other B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, dysregulations are well known for 
adaptive immune cells, such as B and T cells. Here, using single-cell mass 
cytometry, we unraveled unexpected dysregulations for innate immune cells. If 
these cells are known to be crucial for host defense, our results demonstrated 
that they could also be involved in autoimmunity.","Copyright © 2023 Verdier, Fayet, Hemery, Truffault, Pinzón, Demeret, Behin,

the interferon alpha (IFN-α) treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and its 
relationship with clinical indicators.
METHODS: The CHB patients who did not receive any antiviral treatment were set 
as initial treatment group and used pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN α). 
Peripheral blood samples were collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12-24 weeks. 
For IFN-treated patients who entered the plateau were set as plateau group, and 
PEG-IFN α was discontinued and resumed after an interval of 12-24 weeks. 
Besides, we also enrolled some patients who had received oral drug for more than 
6 months as oral drug group without follow up. Peripheral blood was collected 
during the plateau period, which was set as baseline, and after 12-24 weeks of 
intermittent treatment, and after 12-24 weeks of additional treatment with 
PEG-IFN α. The aim of the collection was to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
virology, serology and biochemical indicators, and the NK cell related phenotype 
was detected by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: In the plateau group, subgroup of CD69+CD56dim was higher with 
statistical significance when comparing with the initial treatment group and 
oral drug group [10.49 (5.27, 19.07) vs 5.03 (3.67, 8.58), Z = -3.11, P = 0.002; 
10.49 (5.27, 19.07) vs 4.04 (1.90, 7.26), Z = -5.30, P < 0.001)]. CD57+CD56dim 
was significantly lower than that in initial treatment group and oral drug group 
respectively [68.42±10.37 vs 55.85±12.87, t = 5.84, P < 0.001; 76.38±9.49 vs 
55.85±12.87, t = -9.65, P < 0.001]. The CD56brightCD16- subgroup in the plateau 
group was higher with statistical significance compared with initial treatment 
group and oral drug group respectively [11.64 (6.05, 19.61) vs 3.58 (1.94, 
5.60), Z = -6.35, P < 0.001; 11.64 (6.05, 19.61) vs 2.37 (1.70, 4.30), Z = 
-7.74, P < 0.001)]. CD57+CD56dim in the plateau group had a significant higher 
percentage than that at baseline after IFN discontinuation for 12-24 weeks 
(55.85±12.87 vs 65.95±12.94, t = -2.78, P = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: During the long-term treatment of IFN, the killer subgroup of NK 
cells is continuously depleted, leading to the differentiation of the regulatory 
subgroup into the killer subgroup. In the killing subgroup, although the number 
is continuously depleted, the activity of the subgroup is continuously 
increased. In the plateau phase, after stopping IFN for a period of time, the 
number of NK cell subsets would gradually recover, but was still lower than that 
in the initial treatment group.","Copyright © 2023 Bi, Xie, Wu, Cao, Lin, Yang, Jiang, Deng, Wang, Liu, Gao, Shen,

(1)Department of Stomatology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical 
University, Beijing, China.","BACKGROUND: It is well known that periodontitis has an important impact on 
systemic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate potential crosstalk 
genes, pathways and immune cells between periodontitis and IgA nephropathy 
(IgAN).
METHODS: We downloaded periodontitis and IgAN data from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify shared genes. Then, 
Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
enrichment analyses were performed on the shared genes. Hub genes were further 
screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn 
according to the screening results. Finally, single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) was 
used to analyze the infiltration level of 28 immune cells in the expression 
profile and its relationship with shared hub genes.
RESULTS: By taking the intersection of WGCNA important module genes and DEGs, we 
found that the SPAG4, CCDC69, KRT10, CXCL12, HPGD, CLDN20 and CCL187 genes were 
the most important cross-talk genes between periodontitis and IgAN. GO analysis 
showed that the shard genes were most significantly enriched in kinase regulator 
activity. The LASSO analysis results showed that two overlapping genes (CCDC69 
and CXCL12) were the optimal shared diagnostic biomarkers for periodontitis and 
IgAN. The immune infiltration results revealed that T cells and B cells play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and IgAN.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to use bioinformatics tools to explore the 
close genetic relationship between periodontitis and IgAN. The SPAG4, CCDC69, 
KRT10, CXCL12, HPGD, CLDN20 and CCL187 genes were the most important cross-talk 
genes between periodontitis and IgAN. T-cell and B-cell-driven immune responses 
may play an important role in the association between periodontitis and IgAN.","Copyright © 2023 Gao, Guo, Wang, Liu and Wang.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1062590

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disease with a 
heterogenous clinical presentation and unpredictable response to available 
therapies. This personalized transcriptomics study sought proof-of-concept for 
single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize patient-specific immune profiles.
METHODS: Whole blood samples from six untreated children, newly diagnosed with 
JIA, and two healthy controls were cultured for 24 h with or without ex vivo TNF 
stimulation and subjected to scRNAseq to examine cellular populations and 
transcript expression in PBMCs. A novel analytical pipeline, scPool, was 
developed wherein cells are first pooled into pseudocells prior to expression 
analysis, facilitating variance partitioning of the effects of TNF stimulus, JIA 
disease status, and individual donor.
RESULTS: Seventeen robust immune cell-types were identified, the abundance of 
which was significantly affected by TNF stimulus, which resulted in notable 
elevation of memory CD8 + T-cells and NK56 cells, but down-regulation of naïve 
B-cell proportions. Memory CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells were also both reduced in the 
JIA cases relative to two controls. Significant differential expression 
responses to TNF stimulus were also characterized, with monocytes showing more 
transcriptional shifts than T-lymphocyte subsets, while the B-cell response was 
more limited. We also show that donor variability exceeds the small degree of 
possible intrinsic differentiation between JIA and control profiles. An 
incidental finding of interest was association of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DRB5 
expression with JIA status.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the development of personalized 
immune-profiling combined with ex-vivo immune stimulation for evaluation of 
patient-specific modes of immune cell activity in autoimmune rheumatic disease.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12969-023-00787-x

by multiple organ dysfunction, which is related to a variety of causative 
factors. B-cell overactivation is a key factor in SLE. However, the pathogenesis 
underlying anomalous B cells has not been well elucidated. B-cell fate is 
regulated in diverse epigenetic ways apart from traditional ways. As one of the 
mechanisms of epigenetics, histone modification mainly affects transcription and 
translation by changing the chemical groups on histones by histone modification 
enzymes. JMJD3, a histone demethylase, can promote T-cell proliferation in SLE 
patients, which exacerbates SLE. However, the mechanism of JMJD3 in B cells in 
SLE has not been studied. Here, we found that the mean fluorescence intensity 
(MFI) of JMJD3 in classical memory B cells (CMBs) was higher than that in naïve 
B cells (NBs) from human tonsil tissue; JMJD3 was overexpressed in B cells from 
the peripheral blood of SLE patients compared with healthy controls (HCs). In 
vitro, our experiment showed that JMJD3 could regulate B-cell differentiation by 
promoting naïve B-cell differentiation into CD27+ B cells, and Blimp-1 and Bcl-6 
also decreased after inhibitor treatment. These findings provide a new direction

development and differentiation (257 males; 65.4%) with a median age of 12 
(6-20) years were enrolled in this study. After categorizing patients, 109 
patients had intrinsic B cell defects. More than half of the patients had 
defects in one of the ATM (85 patients), BTK (76 patients), LRBA (34 patients), 
and DOCK8 (33 patients) genes. Fifteen patients (3.8%) showed autoimmune 
complications as their first manifestation. During the course of the disease, 
autoimmunity was reported in 81 (20.6%) patients at a median age of 4 (2-7) 
years, among which 65 patients had mixed intrinsic and extrinsic and 16 had 
intrinsic B cell defects. The comparison between patients with the mentioned 
four main gene defects showed that the patient group with LRBA defect had a 
significantly higher frequency of autoimmunity compared to those with other gene 
defects. Based on the B cell defect stage, 13% of patients with early B cell 
defect, 17% of patients with CSR defect, and 40% of patients who had terminal B 
cell defect presented at least one type of autoimmunity.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that gene mutations involved in human B 
cell terminal stage development mainly LRBA gene defect have the highest 
association with autoimmunity.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10875-023-01442-6

involves a synthesis of clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings. The aim 
of this study was to investigate whether the systemic immune inflammation index 
can be used as an effective parameter in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and 
its reliability in the differentiation of complicated vs. non-complicated 
appendicitis.
METHODS: The study was conducted retrospectively with patients admitted to the 
emergency department with abdominal pain and diagnosed with acute appendicitis. 
In total, 150 patients and 150 control cases were included in the study. 
Demographic data, medical history, white blood cell count, platelet count, 
neutrophil count, systemic immune inflammation index values, Alvarado score, 
adult appendicitis score, and pathology result of appendectomy material were 
retrieved from the hospital automation system and recorded in the data form.
RESULTS: Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and systemic immune inflammation index were 
significantly higher, and platelet-neutrophil ratio and lymphocyte-neutrophil 
ratio were significantly lower in the patient group compared to the control 
group (p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the 
sensitivity and specificity of systemic immune inflammation index with a cutoff 
value of 840.13 was 82 and 66.7%, respectively, for the diagnosis of acute 
appendicitis. Correlation analysis revealed that systemic immune inflammation 
index, Alvarado score, and adult appendicitis score were positively correlated, 
and this correlation was statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Systemic immune inflammation index may be used to promote the 
diagnosis of acute appendicitis and may reduce the need for radiation exposure 
and diagnostic imaging tests such as contrast-enhanced abdominal computed 
tomography. It can also be used to differentiate between complicated and 
non-complicated acute appendicitis cases.","DOI: 10.1590/1806-9282.20221003

risk factors and predictive models for sepsis based on clinical indicators. 
However, these models are usually predictive of all critical patients. This 
study explored the risk factors for 28-day outcomes of patients with sepsis and 
developed a prognosis prediction model.
METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective analysis of sepsis patients 
hospitalized in three intensive care units (ICUs) from September 1st 2015, to 
June 30th 2020. Demographic, clinical history, and laboratory test data were 
extracted from patient records. Investigators explored the risk factors 
affecting 28-day sepsis prognosis by univariate analysis. The effects of 
confounding factors were excluded by multivariate logistic regression analysis, 
and new joint predictive factors were calculated. A model predicting 28-day 
sepsis prognosis was constructed through data processing analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 545 patients with sepsis were included. The 28-day mortality 
rate was 32.3%. Risk factors including age, D-dimer, albumin, creatinine, and 
prothrombin time (PT) were predictive of death from sepsis. The goodness-of-fit 
value for this prediction model was 0.534, and the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve was 0.7207. Further analysis of the immune 
subgroups (n=140) revealed a significant decrease in CD3+, CD4+CD8-, and 
CD4+CD29+ memory effector T lymphocytes and an increase in CD56+ natural killer 
(NK) cells in the hypoalbuminemia group compared with the normal albumin group 
(65.5 vs. 58.3, P=0.005; 41.2 vs. 32.4, P=0.005; 21.8 vs. 17.1, P=0.029; 
12.6 vs. 17.6, P=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for 28-day sepsis mortality include age, D-dimer, 
creatinine, PT, and albumin. A decrease in albumin level may exacerbate 
immunosuppression in patients with sepsis. This study establishes a prediction 
model based on these indicators, which shows a good degree of calibration and 
differentiation. This model may provide good predictive value for clinical 
sepsis prognosis.","© 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Medical

dermatomyositis (MDA5+DM) is an autoimmune disease frequently accompanied by 
rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) with high mortality. T 
cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of MDA5+DM and this study aims to 
measure the frequency and clinical relevance of cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells in 
this disease.
METHODS: T cells expressing Perforin, Granzyme B (GZMB) and Granzyme K (GZMK) 
were analyzed by flow cytometry from peripheral blood of 19 patients with active 
MDA5+DM and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy donors (HDs). The frequency of CD4 
and CD8 T cells and the cytotoxic subsets were compared between patients with 
MDA5+DM and HDs. Correlations within T cell subsets and between T cell subsets 
and clinical parameters of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and Myositis Intention-to-Treat Index 
(MITAX) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Compared with HDs, patients with active MDA5+DM significantly had 
increased frequency of CD4 T cells, and reduced frequency of GZMK+GZMB- CD8 T 
cells. Furthermore, the frequency of GZMK+GZMB- CD8 T cells positively 
correlated with serum ferritin levels in active MDA5+DM patients. Notably, the 
patients in the Dead group of MDA5+DM had a significant higher frequency of 
GZMK+GZMB- CD4 and CD8 T cells.
CONCLUSION: Substantial changes of cytotoxic T cell subsets are observed in 
active MDA5+DM patients. In addition, a high frequency of GZMK+GZMB- CD4 and CD8 
T cells is associated with unfavorable prognosis in MDA5+DM. More studies are 
warranted to further explore the roles of cytotoxic T cells in MDA5+DM.","© 2022 Fengyun Jia et al., published by Sciendo.","DOI: 10.2478/rir-2022-0022

non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, the tumor-related intrinsic 
factors in response to ICIs have mostly been elucidated in tissue samples. 
However, tissue immune status and changes in the immune microenvironment can 
also be reflected and monitored through peripheral blood.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (scTCR) sequencing were conducted 
using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 60 patients with stage IV 
NSCLC. Those samples were prospectively acquired from patients treated with 
anti-PD(L)-1 therapy for advanced lung cancer. Based on the clinical outcomes, 
samples were classified as durable clinical benefit (DCB) and non-durable 
clinical benefit (NCB). The samples constituted paired longitudinal samples, 
consisting of pre-treatment and on-treatment. Additionally, PBMC samples from 60 
healthy donors from the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas project were used as a 
control.
RESULTS: The dynamic changes in major cell types between pre-treatment and 
on-treatment PBMCs were associated with an increase in proliferating T cells and 
NK cells in both DCB and NCB groups. Among T cell subtypes, effector memory CD8+ 
T cells (CD8+ TEM_GZMK_PDCD1) were increased after ICI treatment in both DCB and 
NCB. From the lineage trajectory analysis, effector memory CD8+ T cells resided 
at the bifurcation point, which has the potential to differentiate into lineages 
with precursor exhausted CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TCM cells) assumed to be related to 
the ICI response. From the scTCR-seq, effector memory CD8+ T cells along with T 
cells recognizing unknown antigen expanded and composed of novel clones skewed 
toward dysfunctional status, especially in on-treatment samples of the DCB 
group. The extent of immunophenotype conversion capabilities of the TCR with 
effector memory CD8+ T cells showed remarkable variation in the on-treatment 
sample in the DCB group.
CONCLUSION: A transitioning T cell subtype identified in PBMCs might be related 
to the prolonged ICI response. From our study, expansion of effector memory CD8+ 
T cells with novel TCRs in PBMCs after ICI treatment could contribute to a 
better clinical outcome in patients with NSCLC. This proof-of-concept research 
strengthens the use of non-invasive PBMCs in studying systemic changes of immune 
reactions related to the ICI treatment.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

(#)Contributed equally","T-cell receptor (TCR) binding strength to peptide-MHC antigen complex influences 
numerous T-cell functions. However, the vast diversity of a polyclonal T-cell 
repertoire for even a single antigen greatly increases the complexity of 
studying the impact of TCR affinity on T-cell function. Here, we determined how 
TCR binding strength affected the protein and transcriptional profile of an 
endogenous, polyclonal T-cell response to a known tumor-associated antigen (TAA) 
within the tumor microenvironment (TME). We confirmed that the staining 
intensity by flow cytometry and the counts by sequencing from MHC-tetramer 
labeling were reliable surrogates for the TCR-peptide-MHC steady-state binding 
affinity. We further demonstrated by single-cell RNA sequencing that 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with high and low binding affinity for a 
TAA can differentiate into cells with many antigen-specific transcriptional 
profiles within an established TME. However, more progenitor-like phenotypes 
were significantly biased towards lower affinity T cells, and proliferating 
phenotypes showed significant bias towards high-affinity TILs. In addition, we 
found that higher affinity T cells advanced more rapidly to terminal phases of 
T-cell exhaustion and exhibited better tumor control. We confirmed the 
polyclonal TIL results using a TCR transgenic mouse possessing a single 
low-affinity TCR targeting the same TAA. These T cells maintained a 
progenitor-exhausted phenotype and exhibited impaired tumor control. We propose 
that high-affinity TCR interactions drive T-cell fate decisions more rapidly 
than low-affinity interactions and that these cells differentiate faster. These 
findings illustrate divergent forms of T-cell dysfunction based on TCR affinity 
which may impact TIL therapies and antitumor responses.",©2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-22-0761

differential DNA-methylation pattern.
METHODS: We collected blood samples from 120 medication-overuse 
headache-patients, 57 controls (29 episodic migraine patients and 28 healthy 
controls) in a hypothesis-generating cross-sectional case-control pilot study; 
100 of the medication-overuse headache-patients were followed for six months and 
samples were collected at two and six months for the longitudinal methylation 
analyses. Blood cell proportions of leucocytes (neutrophils, NK-cells, 
monocytes, CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, and B-cells) and the neutrophile-lymphocyte 
ratio were estimated using methylation data as a measure for immunological 
analysis and a cell type-specific epigenome wide association study was conducted 
between medication-overuse headache-patients and controls, and longitudinally 
for reduction in headache days/month among medication-overuse headache-patients.
RESULTS: We found a higher neutrophile-lymphocyte ratio in medication-overuse 
headache-patients compared to controls, indicating a higher immunological 
response in medication-overuse headache-patients (false discovery rate (adjusted 
p-value)<0.001). Reduction in headache days/month (9.8; 95% CI 8.1-11.5) was 
associated with lower neutrophile-lymphocyte ratio (false discovery rate 
adjusted p-value = 0.041).Three genes (CORIN, CCKBR and CLDN9) were 
hypermethylated in specific cell types in medication-overuse headache-patients 
compared to controls. No methylation differences were associated with reduction 
in headache days in medication-overuse headache-patients after six months.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study was consistent with higher immunological response 
in medication-overuse headache-patients which decreased with a reduction in 
headache days in longitudinal analysis. medication-overuse headache-patients 
exhibited differential methylation in innate immune cells but did not exhibit 
longitudinal differences with alterations in headache days. Our study creates

METHOD: Clinical data of 200 patients with PM/DM and 204 healthy controls were 
retrospectively reviewed. We examined whether the PLR and NLR were associated 
with PM/DM.
RESULTS: The PLR and NLR were higher in patients with PM/DM than in controls 
(both P < 0.001). The PLR and NLR were higher in patients with DM than in those 
with PM (both P < 0.01). The PLR was higher in the anti-melanoma

anti-MDA5- PM/DM group (P = 0.002). The NLR in non-survivors was higher than 
that in survivors (P = 0.01). The NLR was positively correlated with the 
occurrence of interstitial lung disease (ILD). The PLR and NLR were independent

microenvironment of HER-2 intratumoral heterogeneity breast cancer. Methods: 
Thirty cases of HER-2 intratumoral heterogeneous breast cancer were 
retrospectively analyzed in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and 
Hospital from November 2017 to June 2020. HER-2 expression was detected by 
immunohistochemistry and verified by dual color silver-enhanced in-situ 
hybridization (D-SISH). HER-2 intratumoral positive and negative regions were 
divided. The pathological characteristics, subtype, and the level of tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of programmed cell 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) were evaluated respectively. Results: The proportion of 
HER-2 positive cells of the breast cancer ranged from 10% to 90%. The 
pathological type was mainly invasive non-special typecarcinoma. Six cases 
presented different pathological types between HER-2 positive and negative 
regions. The HER-2-positive areas included 2 cases of carcinoma with apocrine 
differentiation, and the negative areas included 2 cases of invasive 
micropapillary carcinoma, 1 case of invasive papillary carcinoma, and 1 case of 
carcinoma with apocrine differentiation. In HER-2 positive regions, 17 cases 
were Luminal B and 13 cases were HER-2 overexpressed types. There were 22 cases 
of Luminal B and 8 cases of triple negative tumors in the HER-2 negative areas. 
The levels of TILs in HER-2 positive and negative areas accounted for 53.3% 
(16/30) and 26.7% (8/30), respectively, with a statistically significant 
difference (P=0.035). The positive expression of PD-L1 in HER-2 positive area 
and HER-2 negative area were 6 cases and 9 cases, respectively. Among 8 cases 
with HER-2 negative regions containing triple negative components, 4 cases were 
positive for PD-L1 expression. Conclusions: In the case of HER-2 intratumoral 
heterogeneity, it is necessary to pay attention to both HER-2 positive and 
negative regions, and evaluate subtype separately as far as possible. For HER-2 
intratumoral heterogeneous breast cancer containing triple negative components, 
the treatment mode can be optimized by refining the intratumoral expression of 
PD-L1.","Publisher: 目的： 探讨人表皮生长因子受体2(HER-2)瘤内异质性乳腺癌的病理学特征，及肿瘤免疫微环境与HER-2瘤内异质性的关系。 方法：

indexes including neutrophils and lymphocytes ratio (NLR), platelet and 
lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte and lymphocyte ratio (MLR) provision and 
differentiation degree, infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis number on the 
postoperative recurrence of ESCC. Methods: A total of 130 patients with ESCC who 
underwent radical resection from February 2017 to February 2019 in Nanyang 
Central Hospital were selected and divided into good prognosis group (66 cases) 
and poor prognosis group (64 cases) according to the prognostic effect. The 
clinical data and follow-up data were collected. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was used to determine the independent influencing factors of 
poor prognosis. Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the 
correlation between preoperative NLR, PLR and MLR with the degree of 
differentiation, depth of invasion and number of lymph node metastases. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the efficacy 
of NLR, PLR and MLR in predicting poor prognosis of ESCC. Results: Univariate 
analysis showed that the degree of differentiation, the degree of invasion and 
the number of lymph node metastasis were related to the prognoses of patients 
with ESCC (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the 
degree of differentiation, depth of invasion and number of lymph node metastases 
were independent influencing factors for poor prognosis of patients with ESCC, 
moderate differentiation (OR=2.603, 95% CI: 1.009-6.715) or low differentiation 
(OR=9.909, 95% CI: 3.097-31.706), infiltrating into fibrous membrane (OR=14.331, 
95% CI: 1.333-154.104) or surrounding tissue (OR=23.368, 95% CI: 1.466-372.578), 
the number of lymph node metastases ≥ 3 (OR=9.225, 95% CI: 1.693-50.263) 
indicated poor prognosis. Spearman correlation analysis showed that NLR was 
negatively correlated with the degree of differentiation and the number of lymph 
node metastases (r=-0.281, P=0.001; r=-0.257, P=0.003), PLR was negatively 
correlated with the degree of differentiation, depth of invasion and number of 
lymph node metastasis (r=-0.250, P=0.004; r=0.197, P=0.025; r=-0.194, P=0.027), 
MLR was positively correlated with the degree of differentiation and the number 
of lymph node metastasis (r=0.248, P=0.004; r=0.196, P=0.025). ROC curve 
analysis showed that the areas under the curve of NLR, PLR and MLR in predicting 
poor prognosis of ESCC were 0.971, 0.925 and 0.834, respectively. The best 
cut-off value of NLR was 2.87. The sensitivity and specificity of NLR in 
predicting poor prognosis of ESCC were 90.6% and 87.9%, respectively. The 
optimal cut-off value of PLR was 141.75. The sensitivity and specificity for 
predicting poor prognosis of ESCC were 92.2% and 87.9%, respectively. The best 
cut-off value of MLR was 0.40. The sensitivity and specificity of MLR in 
predicting poor prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were 54.7% and 
100.0%, respectively. Conclusions: The degree of differentiation, the degree of 
invasion and the number of lymph node metastases are closely related to the poor 
prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. NLR, PLR and MLR 
can provide important information for predicting the poor prognosis of 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","Publisher: 目的：

B lineages that helps to maintain immune homeostasis. However, the function of 
Bach2 in the pathogenesis of SLE has not been studied in depth. Flow cytometry 
and qRT-PCR were used to assess Bach2 levels, bisulfite sequencing PCR was used 
to measure the methylation level, and silencing by electroporation and 
stimulation with a cytokine concentration gradient were used to investigate the 
effect of Bach2 on T cells. Bach2 expression was elevated in the helper T-cell 
subsets (T follicular helper, Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells) of SLE patients 
and negatively correlated with disease severity and autoantibody levels. CD4+ T 
cells from SLE patients had decreased methylation levels in the Bach2 promoter 
region. Silencing Bach2 in CD4+ T cells induced increases in the CD19+ B-cell 
count, plasmablasts, and secretion of IgG by prompting the secretion of 
cytokines. The activation signals CD3/CD28, IL-6, and IL-21 upregulated Bach2 
expression in CD4+ T cells. The regulation of Bach2 by cytokines and T-cell 
activation signals in CD4+ T cells was shown to act on B cells and play a

immune responses to maintain homeostasis and self-tolerance. Tregs are crucial 
for preventing illnesses like cancer and autoimmunity. However, contrasting 
patterns of Treg frequency are observed in different autoimmune diseases. The 
commonality of tumour necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) defects and decrease in 
Treg frequency on the onset of autoimmunity demands an in-depth study of the 
TNFR2 pathway. To unravel this mystery, we need to study the mechanism of cell 
survival and death in Tregs. Here, we construct an ordinary differential 
equation (ODE)-based model to capture the mechanism of cell survival and 
apoptosis in Treg cells via TNFR2 signalling. The sensitivity analysis reveals 
that the input stimulus, the concentration of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), is 
the most sensitive parameter for the model system. The model shows that the cell 
goes into survival or apoptosis via bistable switching. Through hysteretic 
switching, the system tries to cope with the changing stimuli. In order to 
understand how stimulus strength and feedback strength influence cell survival 
and death, we compute bifurcation diagrams and obtain cell fate maps. Our 
results indicate that the elevated TNF concentration and increased c-Jun 
N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation are the major contributors to the death 
of T-regulatory cells. Biological evidence cements our hypothesis and can be 
controlled by reducing the TNF concentration. Finally, the system was studied 
under stochastic perturbation to see the effect of noise on the system's 
dynamics. We observed that introducing random perturbations disrupts the 
bistability, reducing the system's bistable region, which can affect the 
system's normal functioning.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","DOI: 10.1007/s10867-023-09625-3

    J Pediatr. 2021 Feb;229:26-32.e2.","AIMS: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in 
children (MIS-C) maintains its importance in the differential diagnosis of 
common febrile diseases. MIS-C should be promptly diagnosed because 
corticosteroid and/or intravenous immunoglobulin treatment can prevent severe 
clinical outcomes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate clinical presentation, 
diagnostic parameters and management of MIS-C and compare its clinical features 
to those of common febrile disease.
METHODS: This study was conducted at a tertiary-level university hospital 
between December 2020 and October 2022. One hundred and six children who were 
initially considered to have MIS-C disease were included in the study. During 
the follow-up period in the hospital, when the clinical and laboratory findings 
were re-evaluated, 38 out of 106 children were diagnosed differently. The 
clinical and laboratory findings of 68 children followed up with the diagnosis 
of MIS-C and 38 children who were initially misdiagnosed as MIS-C but with 
different final diagnoses were retrospectively compared.
RESULTS: We identified 68 patients with MIS-C and 38 patients misdiagnosed as 
MIS-C during the study period. Infectious causes (71%), predominantly bacterial 
origin, were the most frequently confused conditions with MIS-C. Patients with 
MIS-C were older and had a more severe clinical course with high rates of 
respiratory distress, shock, and paediatric intensive care unit admission. While 
rash and conjunctivitis were more common among patients with MIS-C, cough, 
abdominal pain and diarrhoea were observed more frequently in patients 
misdiagnosed as MIS-C. Lower absolute lymphocyte counts, platelet counts and 
higher C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels, pathological findings on 
echocardiography were the distinctive laboratory parameters for MIS-C. 
Multivariate analysis showed that older age, presence of conjunctivitis, high 
level of serum CRP and lower platelets were the most discriminative predictors 
for the diagnosis of MIS-C.
CONCLUSION: There are still no specific findings to diagnose MIS-C, which 
therefore can be confused with different clinical conditions. Further data are 
needed to assist the clinician in the differential diagnosis of MIS-C and the 
diagnostic criteria should be updated over time.","© 2023 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of

underwent BAL according to guidelines, the BAL volume yield, and cell yield, 
concentration, viability, pellet colour and differential count were analysed for 
association with important participant characteristics such as active 
tuberculosis (TB) disease, TB exposure, HIV infection and recent SARS-CoV-2 
infection. In 337 participants, BAL volume and BAL cell count were correlated in 
those with active TB disease, and current smokers. The right middle lobe yielded 
the highest volume. BAL cell and volume yields were lower in older participants, 
who also had more neutrophils. Current smokers yielded lower volumes and higher 
numbers of all cell types, and usually had a black pellet. Active TB disease was 
associated with higher cell yields, and higher proportions of granulocytes, but 
this declined at the end of treatment. HIV infection was associated with lower 
cell yields and more bloody pellets, and recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with a 
higher proportion of lymphocytes. These results allow researchers to optimise 
their participant and end assay selection for projects involving lung immune

while the relationship between m6A modification and immune tolerance post kidney 
transplantation remains unclear. Expression of Wilms tumor 1-associating protein 
(WTAP), an m6A writer, was firstly detected in tolerant kidney transplant 
recipients (TOL). Then the role of WTAP on regulatory T (Treg) cell 
differentiation and function in CD4+ T cells from kidney transplant recipients 
with immune rejection (IR) was investigated. The potential target of WTAP and 
effect of WTAP on immune tolerance in vivo were subsequently verified. WTAP was 
upregulated in CD4+ T cells of TOL and positively correlated with Treg cell 
proportion. In vitro, WTAP overexpression promoted Treg cell differentiation and 
enhanced Treg cell-mediated suppression toward naïve T cells. Forkhead box other 
1 (Foxo1) was identified as a target of WTAP. WTAP enhanced m6A modification of 
Foxo1 mRNA in coding sequence (CDS) region, leading to up-regulation of Foxo1. 
Overexpression of m6A demethylase removed the effect of WTAP overexpression, 
while Foxo1 overexpression reversed these effects. WTAP overexpression 
alleviated allograft rejection in model mice, as evidenced by reduced 
inflammatory response and increased Treg population. Our study suggests that 
WTAP plays a positive role in induction of immune tolerance post kidney 
transplant by promoting Treg cell differentiation and function.","Copyright © 2022 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology. Published by

clinical diagnostic model, the diagnosis of Spinal Tuberculosis (STB) remains 
uncertain. Our study aimed to investigate the possible pathogenesis of STB and 
to develop a clinical diagnostic model for STB based on immune cell 
infiltration.
METHODS: Label-free quantification protein analysis of five pairs of specimens 
was used to determine the protein expression of the intervertebral disc in STB 
and non-STB. GO enrichment analysis, and KEGG pathway analysis were used to 
investigate the pathogenesis of STB. The Hub proteins were then eliminated. Four 
datasets were downloaded from the GEO database to analyze immune cell 
infiltration, and the results were validated using blood routine test data from 
8535TB and 7337 non-TB patients. Following that, clinical data from 164 STB and 
162 non-STB patients were collected. The Random-Forest algorithm was used to 
screen out clinical predictors of STB and build a diagnostic model. The 
differential expression of MMP9 and STAT1 in STB and controls was confirmed 
using immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: MMP9 and STAT1 were STB Hub proteins that were linked to disc 
destruction in STB. MMP9 and STAT1 were found to be associated with Monocytes, 
Neutrophils, and Lymphocytes in immune cell infiltration studies. Data from 
15,872 blood routine tests revealed that the Monocytes ratio and Neutrophils 
ratio was significantly higher in TB patients than in non-TB patients 
(p < 0.001), while the Lymphocytes ratio was significantly lower in TB patients 
than in non-TB patients (p < 0.001). MMP9 and STAT1 expression were 
downregulated following the anti-TB therapy. For STB, a clinical diagnostic 
model was built using six clinical predictors: MR, NR, LR, ESR, BMI, and PLT. 
The model was evaluated using a ROC curve, which yielded an AUC of 0.816.
CONCLUSIONS: MMP9 and STAT1, immune-related hub proteins, were correlated with 
immune cell infiltration in STB patients. MR, NR, LR ESR, BMI, and PLT were 
clinical predictors of STB. Thus, the immune cell Infiltration-related clinical 
diagnostic model can predict STB effectively.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109588

increases the risk of death in people with oncological, infectious, and hormonal 
diseases. The choice of drugs that stimulate the hematopoietic activity of 
B-lymphopoiesis is limited. The current leucopoiesis drugs have a number of side 
effects: thymic preparations stimulate the production of PGE2, which causes 
chronic inflammation and various autoimmune diseases through the differentiation 
of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, the proliferation of Th17 cells, and the production 
of IL-22 from Th22 cells through EP2 and EP4 receptors; cytokine preparations 
can cause uncontrolled immune reactions and impaired contractility of smooth and 
cardiac muscles; drugs based on nucleic acids can stimulate the division of all 
cells, including bacterial and cancerous ones. The use of oligonucleotides such 
as ribozymes and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) shows promise as 
therapeutic moieties, but faces a number of challenges such as nuclease 
sensitivity, off-target effects, and efficient delivery. The search for 
substances that stimulate B-lymphopoiesis among ionic compounds was motivated by 
the discovery of the unique properties of lidocaine docusate, one of the first 
ionic liquid forms of the known drugs. The lidocaine docusate (protonated form 
of lidocaine (2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide + docusate-anion 
(dioctylsulfosuccinate))) suppresses the division of pheochromocytoma cells and 
activates immunity in rats. The trimecaine-based ionic compound (TIC) 
demonstrates high B-lymphopoiesis-stimulating activity. The TIC compound 
stimulates an increase in the volume of transitional B cells, which play an 
important role for further differentiation and formation of a sufficient number 
of mature B1 cells and mature B2 cells, where mature B2 cells make up the bulk 
of the functional population of B lymphocytes. The TIC compound most strongly 
stimulated the restoration of the number of marginal zone B cells, follicular B 
cells, and activated germinal center B cells after the cytotoxic emptying of the 
follicular centers of the spleen induced cyclophosphamide. It significantly 
exceeds the activity of the comparison drug methyluracil. The TIC compound does 
not affect the level of pro-B, pre-B-I, or pre-B-II bone marrow cells, which 
prevents the risk of the formation of immature functionally defective cells.","DOI: 10.3390/molecules28031378

At the same time, the development in C57BL/6 mice of experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE, simulating human multiple sclerosis) happens as a result 
of the violation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell differentiation profiles 
integrated with the production of toxic auto-antibodies splitting the basic 
myelin protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), histones, and DNA. It 
has been shown that IgGs from the plasma of healthy humans and autoimmune 
patients oxidize many different compounds due to their peroxidase 
(H2O2-dependent) and oxidoreductase (H2O2-independent) activities. Here, we 
first analyzed the changes in the relative catalase activity of IgGs from 
C57BL/6 mice blood plasma over time at different stages of the EAE development 
(onset, acute, and remission phases). It was shown that the catalase activity of 
IgGs of 3-month-old mice is, on average, relatively low (kcat = 40.7 min-1), but 
it increases during 60 days of spontaneous development of EAE 57.4-fold (kcat = 
2.3 × 103 min-1). The catalase activity of antibodies increases by a factor of 
57.4 by 20 days after the immunization of mice with MOG (kcat = 2.3 × 103 
min-1), corresponding to the acute phase of EAE development, and 52.7-fold by 60 
days after the treatment of mice with a DNA-histone complex (kcat = 2.1 × 103 
min-1). It is the acceleration of the EAE development after the treatment of 
mice with MOG that leads to the increased production of lymphocytes synthesizing 
antibodies with catalase activity. All data show that the IgGs' catalase 
activity can play an essential role in reducing the H2O2 concentration and 
protecting mice from oxidative stress.","DOI: 10.3390/molecules28031330

(OSA) combined with chronic breathlessness. A significant portion of patients in 
this group have so-called ""overlap syndrome (OVS)"", characterized by chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OVS has more complications and a poorer 
prognosis compared to patients with either OSA or COPD alone, which makes it 
important to identify OVS early in OSA. The current study was a retrospective 
cross-sectional analysis of consecutive adult patients who were diagnosed with 
OSA (n = 1062), of whom 275 were hospitalized due to chronic breathlessness. 
Respiratory and cardiac diseases accounted for the vast majority of causes, 
followed by gastrointestinal and renal disorders. The final study population 
comprised 115 patients with OSA alone (n = 64) and OVS (n = 51), who had chronic 
breathlessness as the primary complaint, not secondary as one of many other 
complaints. Lymphocytes, CD4 counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and 
PLR were differently expressed between the OSA-alone group and OVS group. The 
NLR, lymphocytes, and CD4 counts had a moderate diagnostic value for OVS in OSA 
patients, with AUCs of 0.708 (95% CI, 0.614-0.802), 0.719 (95% CI, 0.624-0.813), 
and 0.744 (95% CI, 0.653-0.834), respectively. The NLR had the highest AUC for 
predicting a 6-month re-admission of OVS, with a cut-off of 3.567 and a moderate 
prognostic value. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.8 and 0.732, 
respectively. In the animal model, the spleen hematoxylin- and eosin-stained, 
electron microscopy images showed germinal-center damage, chromatin activation, 
and mitochondrial swelling under the overlapping effect of intermittent hypoxia 
and cigarette smoke exposure. OSA with chronic breathlessness cannot be 
overstated. A significant proportion of patients with COPD in this group had 
poor lung function at initial diagnosis. The NLR is a useful biomarker to 
differentiate OVS among OSA patients combined with chronic breathlessness.","DOI: 10.3390/jcm12030936

eukaryotes. The intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) evolved 
to withstand cell-autonomous immunity to cause persistent infections and 
disease. A potent inducer of cell-autonomous immunity is the lymphocyte-derived 
cytokine IFNγ. While the production of IFNγ by T cells is essential to protect 
against Mtb, it is not capable of fully eradicating Mtb infection. This suggests 
that Mtb evades a subset of IFNγ-mediated antimicrobial responses, yet what 
mechanisms Mtb resists remains unclear. The IFNγ-inducible Guanylate binding 
proteins (GBPs) are key host defense proteins able to control infections with 
intracellular pathogens. GBPs were previously shown to directly restrict 
Mycobacterium bovis BCG yet their role during Mtb infection has remained 
unknown. Here, we examine the importance of a cluster of five GBPs on mouse 
chromosome 3 in controlling Mycobacterial infection. While M. bovis BCG is 
directly restricted by GBPs, we find that the GBPs on chromosome 3 do not 
contribute to the control of Mtb replication or the associated host response to 
infection. The differential effects of GBPs during Mtb versus M. bovis BCG 
infection is at least partially explained by the absence of the ESX1 secretion 
system from M. bovis BCG, since Mtb mutants lacking the ESX1 secretion system 
become similarly susceptible to GBP-mediated immune defense. Therefore, this 
specific genetic interaction between the murine host and Mycobacteria reveals a 
novel function for the ESX1 virulence system in the evasion of GBP-mediated 
immunity.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24032861

characterization of these cells might serve as a cutting-edge indicator of

immune-mediated idiopathic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, 
manifesting as Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD is 
characterized by exacerbated innate and adaptive immunity in the gut in 
association with microbiota dysbiosis and the disruption of the intestinal 
barrier, resulting in increased bacterial exposure. In response to signals from 
microorganisms and damaged tissue, innate immune cells produce inflammatory 
cytokines and factors that stimulate T and B cells of the adaptive immune 
system, and a prominent characteristic of IBD patients is the accumulation of 
inflammatory T-cells and their proinflammatory-associated cytokines in 
intestinal tissue. Upon antigen recognition and activation, CD4 T-cells 
differentiate towards a range of distinct phenotypes: T helper(h)1, Th2, Th9, 
Th17, Th22, T follicular helper (Tfh), and several types of T-regulatory cells 
(Treg). T-cells are generated according to and adapt to microenvironmental 
conditions and participate in a complex network of interactions among other 
immune cells that modulate the further progression of IBD. This review examines 
the role of the CD4 T-cells most relevant to IBD, highlighting how these cells 
adapt to the environment and interact with other cell populations to promote or 
inhibit the development of IBD.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24032696

cells (Tregs), has been demonstrated to have potent immunosuppressive functions. 
Multiple studies indicate that Tregs could exert important atheroprotective 
effects, but their numbers gradually decrease during atherogenesis. The receptor 
of sFgl2 can be expressed on Treg precursor cells, while the role of sFgl2 on 
Treg differentiation and atherosclerosis progression remains unclear. Firstly, 
we detected that the sFgl2 was decreased in humans and mice with atherosclerotic 
diseases and was especially lower in their vulnerable plaques. Then, we used 
both Adeno-associated virus-sFgl2 (AAV-sFgl2)-injected ApoE-/- mice, which is 
systemic overexpression of sFgl2, and sFgl2TgApoE-/- bone marrow cells 
(BMC)-transplanted ApoE-/- mice, which is almost immune-system-specific 
overexpression of sFgl2, to explore the role of sFgl2 in atherosclerosis. Our 
experiment data showed that AAV-sFgl2 and BMT-sFgl2 could reduce atherosclerotic 
area and enhance plaque stability. Mechanistically, sFgl2 increases the 
abundance and immunosuppressive function of Tregs, which is partly mediated by 
binding to FcγRIIB receptors and phosphorylating Smad2/3. Collectively, sFgl2 
has an atheroprotective effect that is mainly achieved by forming a positive 
feedback pathway with Treg. sFgl2 and Treg could synergistically protect against

various diseases in veterinary medicine. However, donor-dependent cell 
heterogenicity has been a cause of inconsistent therapeutic efficiency. 
Therefore, we established immortalized cells from canine adipose tissue-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) to minimize cellular heterogeneity by reducing 
the number of donors, evaluated their properties, and compared them to the 
primary cells with RNA-sequencing. Immortalized canine ADSCs were established by 
transduction with combinations of the R24C mutation of human cyclin-dependent 
kinase 4 (CDKR24C), canine cyclin D1, and canine TERT. The ADSCs transduced with 
CDK4R24C, cyclin D1, and TERT (ADSC-K4DT) or with CDK4R24C and cyclin D1 
(ADSC-K4D) showed a dramatic increase in proliferation (population doubling 
level >100) without cellular senescence compared to the primary ADSCs. The cell 
surface markers, except for CD90 of the ADSC-K4DT and ADSC-K4D cells, were 
similar to those of the primary ADSCs. The ADSC-K4DT and ADSC-K4D cells 
maintained their trilineage differentiation capacity and chromosome condition, 
and did not have a tumorigenic development. The ability to inhibit lymphocyte 
proliferation by the ADSC-K4D cells was enhanced compared with the primary ADSCs 
and ADSC-K4DT cells. The pathway analysis based on RNA-sequencing revealed 
changes in the pathways mainly related to the cell cycle and telomerase. The 
ADSC-K4DT and ADSC-K4D cells had decreased CD90 expression, but there were no 
obvious defects associated with the decreased CD90 expression in this study. Our 
results suggest that ADSC-K4DT and ADSC-K4D cells are a potential novel cell 
source for mesenchymal stem cell therapy.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24032250

cases. Due to the lack of expression of well-known molecular targets [estrogen 
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)], there is a need for more alternative treatment approaches in 
TNBC. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-based immunotherapy treatment is 
one of the latest treatment technologies with outstanding therapeutic advances 
in the past decade, especially in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, but 
the therapeutic effects of CAR-T cells against solid tumors have not yet shown 
significant clinical benefits. Identification of highly specific CAR-T targets 
in solid tumors is also crucial for its successful treatment. CD22 is reported 
to be a multifunctional receptor that is mainly expressed on the surface of 
mature B-cells (lymphocytes) and is also highly expressed in most B-cell 
malignancies. This study aimed to investigate the expression of CD22 in TNBC. 
Bioinformatic analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of CD22 in 
breast carcinoma and normal tissues. RNA-seq data of normal and breast carcinoma 
patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and differential 
gene expression was performed using R language. Additionally, online 
bioinformatics web tools (GEPIA and TNM plot) were used to evaluate the 
expression of CD22 in breast carcinoma and normal tissues. Western blot (WB) 
analysis and immunofluorescence (IF) were performed to characterize the 
expression of CD22 in TNBC cell lines. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was 
performed on tumor specimens from 97 TNBC patients for CD22 expression. 
Moreover, statistical analysis was performed to analyze the association of 
clinical pathological parameters with CD22 expression. Correlation analysis 
between overall survival data of TNBC patients and CD22 expression was also 
performed. Differential gene expression analysis of TCGA data revealed that CD22 
is among the upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with high 
expression in breast cancer, as compared to normal breast tissues. WB and IF 
analysis revealed high expression of CD22 in TNBC cell lines. IHC results also 
showed that approximately 62.89% (61/97) of TNBC specimens were stained positive 
for CD22. Cell membrane expression of CD22 was evident in 23.71% (23/97) of TNBC 
specimens, and 39.18% (38/97) of TNBC specimens showed cytoplasmic/membrane 
expression, while 37.11% (36/97) specimens were negative for CD22. Furthermore, 
significant associations were found between the size of tumors in TNBC patients 
and CD22 expression, which unveils its potential as a prognostic biomarker. No 
significant correlation was found between the overall survival of TNBC patients 
and CD22 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that CD22 
is highly expressed in TNBC. Based on our findings, we anticipated that CD22 
could be used as a prognostic biomarker in TNBC, and it might be a potential 
CAR-T target in TNBC for whom few therapeutic options exist. However, more 
large-scale studies and clinical trials will ensure its potential usefulness as 
a CAR-T target in TNBC.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24032152

system (CNS) characterised by acute inflammation and subsequent neuro-axonal 
degeneration resulting in progressive neurological impairment. Aberrant immune 
system activation in the periphery and subsequent lymphocyte migration to the 
CNS contribute to the pathophysiology. Recent research has identified metabolic 
dysfunction as an additional feature of MS. It is already well known that energy 
deficiency in neurons caused by impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation 
results in ionic imbalances that trigger degenerative pathways contributing to 
white and grey matter atrophy. However, metabolic dysfunction in MS appears to 
be more widespread than the CNS. This review focuses on recent research 
assessing the metabolism and mitochondrial function in peripheral immune cells 
of MS patients and lymphocytes isolated from murine models of MS. Emerging 
evidence suggests that pharmacological modulation of lymphocytic metabolism may 
regulate their subtype differentiation and rebalance pro- and anti-inflammatory

cells (CTLs) is an important factor in determining prognosis. The migration 
pattern and interaction behavior of intratumoral CTLs are pivotal to tumor 
rejection. NLRP3-dependent proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 play a 
prominent role for CTL induction and differentiation. Here, we investigate the 
effects of T-cellular IL-1R and IL-18R signaling for intratumoral T-cell 
motility. Murine adenocarcinoma cell line Panc02 was stably transfected with 
ovalbumin (OVA) and fluorophore H2B-Cerulean to generate PancOVA H2B-Cerulean 
tumor cells. Dorsal skinfold chambers (DSFC) were installed on wild-type mice, 
and PancOVA H2B-Cerulean tumor cells were implanted into the chambers. PancOVA 
spheroids were formed using the Corning® Matrigel®-based 3D cell culture 
technique. CTLs were generated from OT-1 mice, Il1r-/- OT-1 mice, or Il18r-/- 
OT-1 mice and were marked with fluorophores. This was followed by the adoptive 
transfer of CTLs into tumor-bearing mice or the application into tumor 
spheroids. After visualization with multiphoton microscopy (MPM), Imaris 
software was used to perform T-cell tracking. Imaris analysis indicates a 
significantly higher accumulation of Il18r-/- CTLs in PancOVA tumors and a 
significant reduction in tumor volume compared to wild-type CTLs. Il18r-/- CTLs 
covered a longer distance (track displacement length) in comparison to wild-type 
(WT) CTLs, and had a higher average speed (mean track speed). The analysis of 
instantaneous velocity suggests a higher percentage of arrested tracks (arrests: 
<4 μm/min) for Il18r-/- CTLs. Our data indicate the contribution of IL-18R 
signaling to T-cell effector strength, warranting further investigation on 
phenomena such as intratumoral T-cell exhaustion.","DOI: 10.3390/cells12030456

world. Studies of CLL antibody reactivity have shown differential targets to 
autoantigens and antimicrobial molecular motifs that support the current 
hypothesis of CLL pathogenesis.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted a quantitative serum analysis of 7 
immunoglobulins in CLL and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) patients 
(bead-suspension protein arrays) and a serological profile (IgG and IgM) study 
of autoantibodies and antimicrobial antigens (protein microarrays).
RESULTS: Significant differences in the IgA levels were observed according to 
disease progression and evolution as well as significant alterations in IgG1 
according to IGHV mutational status. More representative IgG autoantibodies in 
the cohort were against nonmutagenic proteins and IgM autoantibodies were 
against vesicle proteins. Antimicrobial IgG and IgM were detected against 
microbes associated with respiratory tract infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative differences in immunoglobulin serum levels could be 
potential biomarkers for disease progression. In the top 5 tumoral antigens, we 
detected autoantibodies (IgM and IgG) against proteins related to cell 
homeostasis and metabolism in the studied cohort. The top 5 microbial antigens 
were associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal infections; moreover, the 
subsets with better prognostics were characterized by a reactivation of 
Cytomegalovirus. The viral humoral response could be a potential prognosis 
biomarker for disease progression.","DOI: 10.3390/cancers15030891

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis (wwMS) is associated with 
a reduction of long-term disability progression. The mechanism that drives this 
effect is unknown, but converging evidence suggests a role for epigenetic 
mechanisms altering immune and/or central nervous system function. In this 
study, we aimed to identify whole blood and immune cell-specific DNA methylation 
patterns associated with parity in relapse-onset MS.
RESULTS: We investigated the association between whole blood and immune 
cell-type-specific genome-wide methylation patterns and parity in 192 women with 
relapse-onset MS, matched for age and disease severity. The median time from 
last pregnancy to blood collection was 16.7 years (range = 1.5-44.4 years). We 
identified 2965 differentially methylated positions in whole blood, 68.5% of 
which were hypermethylated in parous women; together with two differentially 
methylated regions on Chromosomes 17 and 19 which mapped to TMC8 and ZNF577, 
respectively. Our findings validated 22 DMPs and 366 differentially methylated 
genes from existing literature on epigenetic changes associated with parity in 
wwMS. Differentially methylated genes in whole blood were enriched in neuronal 
structure and growth-related pathways. Immune cell-type-specific analysis using 
cell-type proportion estimates from statistical deconvolution of whole blood 
revealed further differential methylation in T cells specifically (four in CD4+ 
and eight in CD8+ T cells). We further identified reduced methylation age 
acceleration in parous women, demonstrating slower biological aging compared to 
nulligravida women.
CONCLUSION: Differential methylation at genes related to neural plasticity 
offers a potential molecular mechanism driving the long-term effect of pregnancy 
on MS outcomes. Our results point to a potential 'CNS signature' of methylation 
in peripheral immune cells, as previously described in relation to MS 
progression, induced by parity. As the first epigenome-wide association study of 
parity in wwMS reported, validation studies are needed to confirm our findings.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13148-023-01438-4

immunodeficiencies that prevent affected individuals from making antibodies and 
requires lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy for survival. The molecular 
basis for XLA is a disruption in B cell development due to mutation in Bruton's 
tyrosine kinase (Btk). Affected individuals inherit a defect that 
prevents precursor B cells in the bone marrow from forming mature, circulating 
B-lymphocytes that would otherwise be capable of proliferating and 
differentiating into antibody-producing plasma cells in secondary 
lymphoid organs like the tonsils and lymph nodes. This dysfunction results 
in dangerously low, clinically undetectable levels of all immunoglobulin 
isotypes in the serum. Without immunoglobulins (or antibodies), XLA patients are 
rendered vulnerable to invasive infections from encapsulated bacteria (such as 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae), 
have an increased incidence of enterovirus infections (e.g., poliovirus, 
coxsackievirus, echovirus), and chronic diarrhea (from Giardia lamblia). XLA 
patients commonly present with a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract 
infections, including sinusitis and otitis media, beginning after 6 to 9 months 
when most of the maternal antibodies have been exhausted.  However, 
hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia, requiring intravenous antibiotics for 
resolution, is usually what prompts the diagnostic work-up for immune deficiency 
disease. The average age of diagnosis is 2.5 years, and almost all cases of XLA 
get diagnosed before 5 years of age. Notably, late-onset forms of XLA also 
exist. There is currently no cure for XLA; however, early management with 
immunoglobulin replacement therapy and antibiotics to prevent and treat 
infections. Although this lifelong avenue is costly, it has been the mainstay of 
treatment for the past fifty years. Any significant delay in diagnosis poses the 
danger of developing chronic, treatment-resistant infections, and end-organ 
damage that cannot be corrected.","Copyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",PMID: 31751055

(2)ASL NA3 SUD","DiGeorge Syndrome (DGS) is a combination of signs and symptoms caused by defects 
in the development of structures derived from the pharyngeal arches during 
embryogenesis. Features of DGS were first described in 1828 but properly 
reported by Dr. Angelo DiGeorge in 1965, as a clinical trial that included 
immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and congenital heart disease. DGS is one 
of several syndromes that has historically grouped under a bigger umbrella 
called 22q11 deletion syndromes, which include Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome, 
velocardiofacial syndrome, Cayler cardiofacial syndrome, Sedlackova syndrome, 
conotruncal anomaly face syndrome, and DGS. Although the genetic etiology of 
these syndromes may be the same, varying phenotypes has supported the use of 
different nomenclature in the past, which has led to confusion in diagnosing 
patients with DGS, which causes potentially catastrophic delays in diagnosis. 
Current literature supports the use of the names of these syndromes 
interchangeably. Features of DGS include an absent or hypoplastic thymus, 
cardiac abnormalities, hypocalcemia, and parathyroid hypoplasia (See ""History 
and Physical"" below). Perhaps, the most concerning characteristic of DGS is the 
lack of thymic tissue, because this is the organ responsible for T lymphocyte 
development. A complete absence of the thymus, though very rare and affecting 
less than 1% of patients with DGS, is associated with a form of severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID). T-cells are a differentiated type of white blood 
cell specializing in certain immune functions: destroying cells that are 
infected or malignant, existing as an integral part of the innate immune system 
by killing viruses (e.g., Killer T-cells), helping B-cells mature to produce 
immunoglobulins for stronger adaptive immunity (e.g. helper T-cells), etc. The 
degree of immunodeficiency of patients with DGS can present differently 
depending on the extent of thymic hypoplasia. Some patients may have a mild to 
moderate immune deficiency, and the majority of patients have cardiac 
anomalies. Other features include palatal, renal, ocular, and gastrointestinal 
anomalies. Skeletal defects, psychiatric disease, and developmental delay are 
also of concern. There are different opinions about syndrome-related alterations 
in cognitive development, and a cognitive decline rather than an early onset 
intellectual disability is observable. The particularities of the clinical 
presentation requires observation on an individual basis, with careful 
evaluation and interprofessional treatment throughout the patient's life.","Copyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",PMID: 31747205

(#)Contributed equally","Treatment with oncolytic measles vaccines (MV) elicits activation of immune 
cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. However, we found that MV-activated 
NK cells show only modest direct cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. To 
specifically direct NK cells towards tumor cells, we developed oncolytic measles 
vaccines encoding bispecific killer engagers (MV-BiKE) targeting CD16A on NK 
cells and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a model tumor antigen. MV-BiKE are 
only slightly attenuated compared to parental MV and mediate secretion of 
functional BiKE from infected tumor cells. We tested MV-BiKE activity in 
cocultures of colorectal or pancreatic cancer cells with primary human NK cells. 
MV-BiKE mediate expression of effector cytokines, degranulation and specific 
anti-tumor cytotoxicity by NK cells. Experiments with patient-derived pancreatic 
cancer cultures indicate that efficacy of MV-BiKE may vary between individual 
tumors with differential virus permissiveness. Remarkably, we confirmed MV-BiKE

ability of humans to elicit robust antibody responses following exposure to 
foreign antigens underpins long-lived humoral immunity and serological memory, 
as well as the success of most currently administered vaccines. However, B cells 
also have a dark side - they can cause myriad diseases, including autoimmunity, 
atopy, allergy and malignancy. Thus, it is critical to understand the molecular 
requirements for generating effective, high-affinity, specific immune responses 
following natural infection or vaccination, as well as for constraining B-cell 
function to mitigate B-cell-mediated immune dyscrasias. In this review, we 
discuss recent developments that have been derived from the identification and 
detailed analysis of individuals with inborn errors of immunity that disrupt 
cytokine signalling, resulting in immune dysregulatory conditions. These studies 
have defined fundamental cytokine/cytokine receptor/signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathways that are critical for the 
generation and maintenance of human memory B-cell and plasma cell subsets during 
host defence, as well as revealed mechanisms of disease pathogenesis causing 
immune deficiency, autoimmunity and atopy. More importantly, these studies have 
identified molecules that could be targeted to either enhance humoral immunity 
in the settings of infection or vaccination, or attenuate humoral immunity that 
contributes to antibody-mediated autoimmunity or allergy.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.coi.2023.102286

leukemia. Patients of advanced age are more likely to develop the condition, 
which has a highly varied clinical course. Consideration of illness features and 
preceding treatment sequence, as well as patient preferences and comorbidities, 
is necessary for selecting the appropriate treatment for the appropriate 
patient. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers with high 
sensitivity and specificity to detect CLL early, monitor CLL patients, select 
the treatment responders, and reduce ineffective treatment, unwanted side 
effects, and unnecessary expenses. In both homeostasis and illness, microRNAs 
(miRNAs/miRs) play a vital role as master regulators of gene expression and, by 
extension, protein expression. MiRNAs typically reduce the stability of mRNAs, 
including those encoding genes involved in tumorigenesis processes as cell cycle 
regulation, inflammation, stress response, angiogenesis, differentiation, 
apoptosis, and invasion. Due to their unique properties, miRNAs are rapidly 
being exploited as accurate biomarkers for illness detection, and medicines 
based on miRNA targets are finding widespread application in clinical practice. 
Accordingly, the current review serves as a quick primer on CLL and the 
biogenesis of miRNAs. In addition to providing a brief overview of the miRNAs 
whose function in the progression of CLL has been established by recent in vitro 
or in vivo research through articulating the influence of these miRNAs on a wide 
variety of cellular functions, including increased proliferative potential; 
support for angiogenesis; cell cycle aberration; evasion of apoptosis; promotion 
of metastasis; and reduced sensitivity to specific treatments.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.prp.2023.154363

IL-21-expressing CD4 T cells are present in pancreatic islets where they 
contribute to T1D progression. However, little is known about their phenotype 
and differentiation states. To fill this gap, we generated, to our knowledge, a 
novel IL-21 reporter NOD strain to further characterize IL-21+ CD4 T cells in 
T1D. IL-21+ CD4 T cells accumulate in pancreatic islets and recognize β cell 
Ags. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that CD4 T effector cells in islets 
actively express IL-21 and they are highly diabetogenic despite expressing 
multiple inhibitory molecules, including PD-1 and LAG3. Islet IL-21+ CD4 T cells 
segregate into four phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct 
differentiation states, that is, less differentiated early effectors, T 
follicular helper (Tfh)-like cells, and two Th1 subsets. Trajectory analysis 
predicts that early effectors differentiate into both Tfh-like and terminal Th1 
cells. We further demonstrated that intrinsic IL-27 signaling controls the 
differentiation of islet IL-21+ CD4 T cells, contributing to their helper 
function. Collectively, our study reveals the heterogeneity of 
islet-infiltrating IL-21+ CD4 T cells and indicates that both Tfh-like and Th1 
subsets produce IL-21 throughout their differentiation process, highlighting the 
important sources of IL-21 in T1D pathogenesis.","Copyright © 2023 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.2200712

delayed long-lasting T cell-independent (TD) response through highly ordered 
transcriptional programs, yet the detailed underlying mechanisms are unclear. 
Since DNA methylation plays a key role in controlling gene expression and 
lineage specification, we explored the dynamics of whole-genome cytosine 
modifications during the ex vivo response of human B cells isolated from normal 
individuals by negative selection. We found that B cell differentiation 
following TI and TD signalling is accompanied by extensive remodelling of the 
epigenome, including global gain and loss of DNA methylation. The epigenetic 
changes map to different regions of the B cell genome, including non- 
C-phosphate-G CpG islands, indicating that modifications of distal regulatory 
elements likely regulate specific gene transcription in B cells. Non-CpG 
methylation also occurs in differentiating human B cells, suggesting that this 
DNA modification is involved in transcriptional regulation of B cell genes with 
promoters exhibiting a low-density methylation, possibly by changing the 
chromatin shape that could have an impact on gene expression. Most strikingly, 
compared to TD activation, stimulation of B cells through an innate pathway 
induced higher levels of DNA methylation modifications at CpG, CHG and CGG 
contexts, supporting the view that DNA methylation modifications are used in 
distinct trajectories to specify the TI and TD B lymphocyte responses.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/imm.13632

disease, which makes the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy a difficult problem. 
While ferroptosis, as an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, it plays 
an important role in causing several types of cancer. This study is aimed at 
exploring the prognostic value of ferroptosis-related genes in DLBCL. Methods: 
In our study, mRNA expression and matching clinical data of DLBCL patients were 
derived from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. First, multivariate cox 
regression model and nomogram which can predict the DLBCL patients' prognosis 
were built and validated. The multigene signature was constructed and optimized 
by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) cox regression 
model. Also, ferroptosis-related subtypes were developed by consistent cluster. 
Last but not least, we explored the association between categories of 
infiltrating immune cells and model genes' expression. Results: Our results 
showed that 27 gene expressions were correlated with overall survival (OS) in 
the univariate cox regression analysis. A 4-gene signature was constructed 
through these genes to stratify patients into high-low risk groups using risk 
score derived from model (model 1:gene expression model). The OS of patients in 
the high-risk group was shorter than that of patients in the low-risk group in 
the TNM stage and clinically distinct subtypes (activated B cell [ABC], germinal 
center B cell [GCB]) (P < .001). Furthermore, it was shown that the risk score 
was an independent factor in clinical cox regression model for OS (model 
2:clinical model) (HR>1, P < .010). Besides, in consistent cluster analysis, 
ferroptosis prognosis status was different among 3 subtypes. Moreover, the 
correlation analysis between 4-gene with immune cells showed dendritic cells may 
be significantly associated with DLBCL. Conclusion: This research constructed an 
innovative ferroptosis-related gene signature for prognostic estimation of DLBCL 
patients. Solutions targeting ferroptosis could be an important therapeutic 
intervention for DLBCL.","DOI: 10.1177/15330338221147772

(cAMP) levels in T cells. cAMP as ubiquitous second messenger is crucial for 
adequate physiology of T cells by mediating effector T cell (Teff) function as 
well as regulatory T cell (Treg)-mediated immunosuppression. Several GPCRs have 
been identified to be crucial for Teff and Treg function. However, the role of 
the orphan, constitutively active Gs-coupled GPCR GPR52 is unknown. Here we show 
that GPR52 regulates cAMP levels in T cells but does not affect T cell function. 
We found that stimulation of transfected HEK cells or primary T cells with a 
GPR52 agonist results in a rise of intracellular cAMP. However, neither Gpr52 
deficiency nor pharmacological modulation of GPR52 by antagonists or agonists 
affected T cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation or Treg-mediated 
immunosuppression. Moreover, Gpr52 deletion did not modify the clinical disease 
course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results 
demonstrate that a modulation of cAMP levels in T cells does not inevitably 
result in altered T cell function. While we could not identify an obvious role 
of GPR52 in in vitro T cell assays and in vivo CNS autoimmunity, it might 
regulate T cell function in a different context or affect the function of other

of cellular analysis and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in differentiating pulmonary non-infectious 
and infectious diseases in immunocompetent patients.
METHODS: The present retrospective study was conducted from December 2017 to 
March 2020, and included immunocompetent patients with suspected pulmonary 
infection. High-resolution computed tomography, total cell counts and 
classification of BALF, conventional microbiological tests (CMTs), laboratory 
tests and mNGS of BALF were performed. Patients were assigned to pulmonary 
non-infectious disease (PNID) and pulmonary infectious disease (PID) groups 
based on final diagnoses. PNID-predictive values were analyzed via areas under 
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Optimal cutoffs were determined 
by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients suspected of pulmonary infection were enrolled 
in the study, 23 (22.5%) with PNID and 79 (77.5%) with PID. The diagnostic 
efficiency of BALF mNGS for differentiating PID from PNID was better than that 
of CMTs. Neutrophil percentage (N%) and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes 
(N/L) in BALF were significantly lower in the PNID group than in the PID group. 
The AUCs for distinguishing PNID and PID were 0.739 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.636-0.825) for BALF N%, 0.727 (95% CI 0.624-0.815) for BALF N/L, and 
0.799 (95% CI 0.702-0.876) for BALF mNGS, with respective cutoff values of 6.7%, 
0.255, and negative. Joint models of BALF mNGS combined with BALF N/L or BALF N% 
increased the respective AUCs to 0.872 (95% CI 0.786-0.933) and 0.871 (95% CI 
0.784-0.932), which were significantly higher than those for BALF mNGS, BALF N%, 
and BALF N/L alone.
CONCLUSIONS: BALF N% ≤ 6.7% or BALF N/L ≤ 0.255 combined with a negative BALF 
mNGS result can effectively distinguish PNID from PID in immunocompetent 
patients with suspected pulmonary infection. BALF mNGS outperforms CMTs for 
identifying pathogens in immunocompetent patients, and the combination of mNGS 
and CMTs may be a better diagnostic strategy.","Copyright © 2023 Pan, Zhang, Sun, Zhang, Bao, Yin, Zhang and Zhang.","DOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2022.1023978

CD4 (nCD4) T cells undergo programmed cell differentiation, mediated by 
epigenetic changes, in response to external stimuli leading to a baseline 
homeostatic state that may determine lifelong disease risk. However, the 
ontogeny of epigenetic signatures associated with CD4 T cell activation during 
key developmental periods are yet to be described. We investigated genome-wide 
DNA methylation (DNAm) changes associated with nCD4 T activation following 72 h 
culture in media+anti-CD3/CD28 beads in healthy infants (aged 12 months, n = 18) 
and adolescents (aged 10-15 years, n = 15). We integrated these data with 
transcriptomic and cytokine profiling from the same samples. nCD4 T cells from 
both age groups show similar extensive epigenetic reprogramming following 
activation, with the majority of genes involved in the T cell receptor signaling 
pathway associated with differential methylation. Additionally, we identified 
differentially methylated probes showing age-specific responses, that is, 
responses in only infants or adolescents, including within a cluster of T cell 
receptor (TCR) genes. These encoded several TCR alpha joining (TRAJ), and TCR 
alpha variable (TRAV) genes. Cytokine data analysis following stimulation 
revealed enhanced release of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-10, in nCD4 T cells from 
adolescents compared with infants. Overlapping differential methylation and 
cytokine responses identified four probes potentially underpinning these 
age-specific responses. We show that DNAm in nCD4T cells in response to 
activation is dynamic in infancy and adolescence, with additional evidence for 
age-specific effects potentially driving variation in cytokine responses between 
these ages.","© 2023 The Authors. Immunology & Cell Biology published by John Wiley & Sons

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The mortality rate of ovarian cancer ranks first among three common 
gynecological malignant tumors due to insidious onset and lack of effective 
early diagnosis methods. Borderline epithelial ovarian tumor (BEOT) is a type of 
low malignant potential tumor that is typically associated with better outcomes 
than ovarian cancer. However, BEOTs are easily confused with benign and 
malignant epithelial ovarian tumors (EOTs) due to similar clinical symptoms and 
lack of specific tumor biomarkers and imaging examinations. Notably, a small 
subset of BEOTs will transform into low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with a 
poor prognosis. Therefore, searching for potential biomarkers that can be easily 
obtained and accurately identify malignant epithelial ovarian tumors (MEOTs) as 
well as BEOTs is essential for the clinician. Cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is a 
commonly used biomarker for the diagnosis of EOTs in the preoperative scenario 
but has low sensitivity and specificity. Nowadays, inflammatory biomarkers 
including inflammatory cell counts and derived ratios such as 
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have been 
proved to be associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, and were 
considered to be the most economically potential surrogate biomarkers for 
various malignancies. The purpose of this study was to find appropriate 
combinations of inflammatory and tumor biomarkers to improve the diagnostic 
efficiency of EOTs, especially the BEOTs.
RESULTS: CA125, NLR and PLR increased steadily among benign, borderline and 
malignant EOTs and tended to be higher in advanced (stage III-IV) and lymph node 
metastasis MEOT groups than in early stage (stage I-II) and non-lymph node 
metastasis MEOT groups. CA125, NLR and PLR could be used separately in the 
differentiation of EOTs but could not take into account both sensitivity and 
specificity. The combined use of CA125, NLR and PLR was evaluated to be more 
efficient, especially in the identification of BEOTs, with both high sensitivity 
and high specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of CA125, NLR and PLR were closely related to the nature 
of EOTs and malignant progression of MEOTs. The combination of CA125, NLR and 
PLR was more accurate in identifying the nature of EOTs than either alone or 
double combination, especially for BEOTs.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13048-023-01106-4

(#)Contributed equally","Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the deadliest malignant tumors affecting women 
worldwide. The predictive value of some blood inflammatory composite markers in 
OC has been extensively reported. They can be used for early detection and 
differential diagnosis of OC and can be used for predicting survival, treatment 
response, and recurrence in the affected patients. Here, we reviewed the 
predictive values of composite inflammatory markers based on complete blood 
count, namely neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, and systemic inflammation index and markers 
based on blood protein, namely C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio and 
prognostic nutritional index in OC, with a focus on NLR and PLR. We referred to 
the clinical studies on these six markers, reviewed the patient population, and 
summarized the marker cut-off values, significance, and limitations of these 
studies. All these studies were retrospective and most of them were 
single-center clinical studies with small sample sizes. We found that the 
cut-off values of these markers have not been unified, and methods used to 
determine these values varied among studies. The predictive value of these 
markers on survival was mainly reflected in the postoperative patients of 
multiple subtypes of ovarian cancer including epithelial OC, high-grade serous 
ovarian carcinoma, and ovarian clear cell carcinoma. We focused on NLR and PLR 
and calculated their pooled hazard ratios. NLR and PLR were reliable in 
predicting overall and progression-free survivals in patients with OC. 
Therefore, it is necessary to adjust important confounding factors and conduct a 
long-term follow-up prospective cohort study to further clarify the cut-off 
values of NLR and PLR and their clinical applications.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13048-023-01116-2

genes, which play a major role in COVID-19 symptomatology and susceptibility. 
Here, we had a unique opportunity to investigate, for the first time, COVID-19 
outcomes in six unvaccinated young Brazilian patients with Turner syndrome (TS; 
45, X0), including one case of critical illness in a child aged 10 years, to 
evaluate their immune response according to their genetic profile.
METHODS: A serological analysis of humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2, 
phenotypic characterization of antiviral responses in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells after stimuli, and the production of cytotoxic cytokines of T 
lymphocytes and natural killer cells were performed in blood samples collected 
from the patients with TS during the convalescence period. Whole exome 
sequencing was also performed.
RESULTS: Our volunteers with TS showed a delayed or insufficient humoral immune 
response to SARS-CoV-2 (particularly immunoglobulin G) and a decrease in 
interferon-γ production by cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+ T 
lymphocytes after stimulation with toll-like receptors 7/8 agonists. In 
contrast, we observed a higher cytotoxic activity in the volunteers with TS than 
the volunteers without TS after phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin stimulation, 
particularly granzyme B and perforin by CD8+ and natural killer cells. 
Interestingly, two volunteers with TS carry rare genetic variants in genes that 
regulate type I and III interferon immunity.
CONCLUSION: Following previous reports in the literature for other conditions, 
our data showed that patients with TS may have an impaired immune response 
against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, other medical conditions associated with TS 
could make them more vulnerable to COVID-19.",Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ijid.2023.01.042

maturation of T cells, which are part of the Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg immune 
responses triggered by visceral leishmaniasis. The maturation and immunological 
development of T lymphocytes require a bidirectional interaction between the 
thymic microenvironment of epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages 
and the extracellular matrix with differentiating lymphocytes.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the morphological characteristics and tissue 
distribution of hematopoietic and stromal cells in the thymuses of hamsters 
experimentally infected with Leishmania infantum, aiming to gain an insight into 
the pathophysiology of the disease.
METHODS: Fifteen hamsters were subjected to intraperitoneal experimental 
infection with 107L. infantum promastigotes (MHOM/BR/1972/BH46). The animals 
were divided into three groups, each comprising five infected hamsters, and were 
then euthanized 15, 60, and 120 days postinfection. The control groups consisted 
of three groups of five healthy hamsters euthanized simultaneously with the 
infected ones. Thymic morphology was evaluated through histopathology and the 
cell composition through immunohistochemistry. We used antibodies to mark 
mesenchymal cells (anti-vimentin), epithelial cells (anti-cytokeratin), 
macrophages (anti-MAC387), B lymphocytes (anti-CD79a), and T lymphocytes 
(anti-CD3). Immunohistochemistry was also used to mark the parasite in the 
thymus.
RESULTS: Infected and control hamsters showed no difference in thymic morphology 
and degree of atrophy. After 15 days of infection, CD3 + T lymphocytes in the 
thymus showed an increase that stabilized over time. At 120 days of infection, 
we detected a significant decrease in CD79a+ B lymphocytes. The parasite was 
present in the medullary and corticomedullary regions of 9 out of 15 hamsters. 
These findings confirm that the presence of a parasite can cause changes in a 
thymus cell population. However, further studies are needed to evaluate these 
changes' effects on the immune response of infected animals.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2023.110558

pneumonia and lymphopenia. We investigated the predictive value of T-lymphocyte 
subset absolute counts for outcomes following coronavirus disease-2019 
(COVID-19)-associated acute respiratory failure (C-ARF).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of adult patients with C-ARF 
was undertaken from 23 March 2020 to 20 November 2021 to obtain relevant data. 
Patients were divided into two groups based on survival. The T-lymphocyte 
subsets were determined by flow cytometric analysis. A binomial logistic 
regression was performed to ascertain factors affecting survival. Cut-off values 
to differentiate between survivors and non-survivors were identified with the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 379 patients were analyzed. Age was negatively correlated 
with survival. Non-survivors had significantly lower T-lymphocyte subset 
absolute counts than survivors. Serum ferritin levels were significantly higher 
in non-survivors. Baseline lymphocyte (%) and a subset were predictive of 
survival in patients [lymphocyte (%) <5.65%, CD3+ <321 cells/µL, CD4+ <205 
cells/µL, CD8+ <103 cells/µL].
CONCLUSIONS: Lower T-lymphocyte subsets were associated with higher mortality in 
patients with C-ARF. Monitoring trends may help in identifying patients at 
increased risk of poor outcomes.

responses. This study aims to explore prognosis and immunotherapeutic biomarkers 
related to autophagy in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD).
METHODS: Based on R software, we performed the ssGSEA, differential expression 
analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, correlation analysis, and enrichment 
analysis. For wet experiment, we did qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and CCK-8 
experiments.
RESULTS: Using autophagy-related genes (ARGs) and the ssGSEA, COAD patients were 
divided into low and high autophagy groups. For immune score, stromal score, 
tumor purity, tumor infiltrating immune cells, co-signaling molecules, tumor 
mutational burden, microsatellite instability, mismatch repair, immune-related 
pathways, immune signatures, somatic mutations and subtype analysis, high 
autophagy group might benefit more from immunotherapy. Among 232 ARGs, IFNG was 
generally significantly correlated with tumor immunotherapy biomarkers (PD-L1, 
CD8A and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)). The disease-free survival of high IFNG 
group was significantly longer than that of low group. On above-mentioned 
immune-related research, the high IFNG group reached the same conclusion. The 
qRT-PCR and IHC analysis confirmed that IFNG was significantly higher expressed 
in dMMR samples compared to pMMR samples. For chemotherapy, the autophagy and 
IFNG were significantly negatively related to the chemosensitivity to cisplatin; 
IFNG inhibitor glucosamine increased cisplatin chemoresistance while IFNG 
increased cisplatin chemosensitivity; IFNG could reverse glucosamine induced 
chemoresistance. The functional enrichment analysis of IFNG, PD-L1, CD8A and 20 
similar proteins were related to the activation of the immune system. The GSEA 
and ceRNA network partly described interaction mechanisms of IFNG with PD-L1 and 
CD8A.
CONCLUSION: Autophagy score and IFNG expression were novel immunotherapy 
predictive biomarkers, which might play predictive effects through the JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway. IFNG might be a potential targeted therapy for cisplatin 
resistant colon cancer. Besides, IFNG was also a prognostic indicator.","Copyright © 2023 Yue, Cai, Zhu, Liu, Chen, Wang and Rong.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1064704

the memory CD8 T cell pool, as different subsets display distinct tissue 
localization preferences, cytotoxic ability, and proliferative capacity, but all

radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and only some KIRC patients can benefit from 
immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Cuproptosis is a new mechanism of cell 
death, which is closely related to tumor progression, prognosis and immunity. 
The identification of prognostic markers related to cuproptosis in KIRC may 
provide targets for treatment and improve the prognosis of KIRC patients. 
Methods: Ten cuproptosis-related genes were analyzed for differential expression 
in KIRC-TCGA and a prognostic model was constructed. Nomogram diagnostic model 
was used to screen independent prognostic molecules. The screened molecules were 
verified in multiple datasets (GSE36895 and GSE53757), and in KIRC tumor tissues 
by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical correlation of 
cuproptosis-related independent prognostic molecules was analyzed. According to 
the molecular expression, the two groups were divided into high and low 
expression groups, and the differences of immune checkpoint and tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) between the two groups were compared by EPIC 
algorithm. The potential Immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) response of high and 
low expression groups was predicted by the ""TIDE"" algorithm. Results: FDX1 and 
DLAT were protective factors, while CDKN2A was a risk factor. FDX1 was an 
independent prognostic molecule by Nomogram, and low expressed in tumor tissues 
compared with adjacent tissues (p < 0.05). FDX1 was positively correlated with 
CD274, HAVCR2, PDCD1LG2, and negatively correlated with CTLA4, LAG3, and PDCD1. 
The TIDE score of low-FDX1 group was higher than that of high-FDX1 group. The 
abundance of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and Endothelial cells in FDX1-low group 
was lower than that in FDX1-high group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: FDX1, as a key 
cuproptosis-related gene, was also an independent prognostic molecule of KIRC. 
FDX1 might become an interesting biomarker and potential therapeutic target for 
KIRC.","Copyright © 2023 Yao, Chen, Lou and Chen.","DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2023.1071694

chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and other T cell-based therapies1-5. As T cell 
differentiation and functional states are associated with distinct epigenetic 
profiles6,7, we hypothesized that epigenetic programming may provide a means to 
improve CAR T cell performance. Targeting the gene that encodes the epigenetic 
regulator ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2)8 presents an interesting opportunity 
as its loss may enhance T cell memory9,10, albeit not cause malignancy9,11,12. 
Here we show that disruption of TET2 enhances T cell-mediated tumour rejection 
in leukaemia and prostate cancer models. However, loss of TET2 also enables 
antigen-independent CAR T cell clonal expansions that may eventually result in 
prominent systemic tissue infiltration. These clonal proliferations require 
biallelic TET2 disruption and sustained expression of the AP-1 factor BATF3 to 
drive a MYC-dependent proliferative program. This proliferative state is 
associated with reduced effector function that differs from both canonical T 
cell memory13,14 and exhaustion15,16 states, and is prone to the acquisition of 
secondary somatic mutations, establishing TET2 as a guardian against 
BATF3-induced CAR T cell proliferation and ensuing genomic instability. Our 
findings illustrate the potential of epigenetic programming to enhance T cell 
immunity but highlight the risk of unleashing unchecked proliferative responses.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41586-022-05692-z

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Tumour-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) play a crucial 
role in cancer immunomodulation. In addition to tumour immune microenvironment, 
the peripheral immune system also contributes significantly to cancer 
progression and is essential for anticancer immunity. However, a comprehensive 
definition of which and how peripheral immune lineages are regulated by 
tumour-derived sEVs during cancer development remains incomplete.
METHODS: In this study, we used mass cytometry with extensive antibody panels to 
comprehensively construct the systemic immune landscape in response to tumour 
development and tumour-derived sEVs.
RESULTS: Systemic immunity was dramatically altered by tumour growth and 
tumour-derived sEVs. Tumour-derived sEVs significantly and extensively affected 
immune cell population composition as well as intracellular pathways, resulting 
in an immunosuppressive peripheral and tumour immune microenvironment, 
characterised by increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and decreased 
Ly6C+CD8 T cells. These sEVs largely promoted hematopoietic recovery and 
accelerate the differentiation towards myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The 
knockdown of Rab27a reduced sEV secretion from tumour cells and delayed tumour 
growth and metastasis in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that tumour-derived sEVs function as a 
bridge between peripheral immunity regulation and the tumour microenvironment, 
and contribute to cancer progression through altering the composition and 
function of the global immune macroenvironment.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41416-023-02175-4

family) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders, 
including autoimmune and allergic diseases. Survivin is constantly expressed in 
the proliferating hematopoietic progenitor cells, and it is re-expressed in the 
mature cells of the innate and adaptive immunity, upon activation. Survivin 
enhances the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC class II molecules 
in dendritic cells, and promotes the lifespan of macrophages, neutrophils, and 
eosinophils, while suppressing natural killer (NK) cell activity. Survivin has 
been implicated in T cell maturation, T cell expansion, effector CD4+ T cell 
differentiation, maintenance of memory CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, as well as 
antibody production. Upregulated expression of survivin was indicated in the T 
cells as well as various samples collected from allergic patients. Survivin can 
contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases via the promotion of the Th2 
polarization, promoting IL-4 expression, compromising activation-induced cell 
death (AICD) in Th2 cells, and preventing apoptosis of eosinophils, as well as, 
amplification of eosinophilia. Moreover, survivin can interfere with clonal 
deletion of autoreactive T and B cells, as well as suppress Treg cell 
development and activity supporting the development of autoimmune diseases. This 
review discusses the role of survivin in immunity, allergy and autoimmunity as 
well as provides evidence that survivin may be considered as a novel therapeutic 
target for the treatment of allergic and autoimmune diseases.","Copyright © 2023 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

function. However, the role of ICOS in Tfr cell differentiation remains unclear. 
Using Foxp3-Cre-mediated ICOS knockout (ICOS FC) mice, we show that ICOS 
deficiency in Treg-lineage cells drastically reduces the number of Tfr cells 
during GC reactions but has a minimal impact on conventional Treg cells. 
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Foxp3+ cells at an early stage of the GC 
reaction suggests that ICOS normally inhibits Klf2 expression to promote 
follicular features including Bcl6 up-regulation. Furthermore, ICOS 
costimulation promotes nuclear localization of NFAT2, a known driver of CXCR5 
expression. Notably, ICOS FC mice had an unaltered overall GC B-cell output but 
showed signs of expanded autoreactive B cells along with elevated autoantibody 
titers. Thus, our study demonstrates that ICOS costimulation is critical for Tfr

Glucocorticoids (GCS) have been extensively used to treat uveitis, though the 
mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the 
regulatory effects of prednisone acetate (PA) on the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg 
balance in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) through modulating the Notch 
signaling pathway. Briefly, Lewis rats were randomly divided into the normal 
control (NC), EAU, and EAU + PA groups. Rats in EAU and EAU + PA groups were 
induced EAU, while those in the EAU + PA group were treated with PA. Clinical 
and histopathological scores were employed to assess the progression of EAU. The 
expression levels of Notch signaling-related molecules (Notch1, Notch2, Dll3, 
Dll4, and Rbpj) and Th-associated cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17) were 
assessed via quantitative PCR (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). In addition, the frequencies of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells were 
detected by flow cytometry. These experimental results indicated that activation 
of the Notch signaling pathway occurred in EAU rats and resulted in a severe 
imbalance of the Th17/Treg and Th1/Th2 ratios. PA treatment significantly 
alleviated ocular inflammation, inhibited activation of the Notch signaling 
pathway, and declined Th1, and Th17 cell differentiation, thereby restoring the 
Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance. Collectively, PA can positively enhance the 
systemic immune response and improve the intraocular microenvironmental 
homeostasis by inhibiting activation of the Notch signaling pathway and by 
restoring Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance, thus achieving the goal of treating 
uveitis.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.109809

(#)Contributed equally","The myeloid C-type lectin receptor (CLR) MINCLE senses the mycobacterial cell 
wall component trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate (TDM). Recently, we found that IL-4 
downregulates MINCLE expression in macrophages. IL-4 is a hallmark cytokine in 
helminth infections, which appear to increase the risk for mycobacterial 
infection and active tuberculosis. Here, we investigated functional consequences 
of IL-4 and helminth infection on MINCLE-driven macrophage activation and 
Th1/Th17 adjuvanticity. IL-4 inhibited MINCLE and cytokine induction after 
macrophage infection with Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). 
Infection of mice with BCG upregulated MINCLE on myeloid cells, which was 
inhibited by IL-4 plasmid injection and by infection with the nematode 
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis in monocytes. To determine the impact of helminth 
infection on MINCLE-dependent immune responses, we vaccinated mice with a 
recombinant protein together with the MINCLE ligand trehalose-6,6-dibehenate 
(TDB) as adjuvant. Concurrent infection with N. brasiliensis or with Schistosoma 
mansoni promoted T cell-derived IL-4 production and suppressed Th1/Th17 
differentiation in the spleen. In contrast, helminth infection did not reduce 
Th1/Th17 induction by TDB in draining peripheral lymph nodes, where IL-4 levels 
were unaltered. Upon use of the TLR4-dependent adjuvant G3D6A, N. brasiliensis 
infection impaired selectively the induction of splenic antigen-specific Th1 but 
not of Th17 cells. Inhibition of MINCLE-dependent Th1/Th17 responses in mice 
infected with N. brasiliensis was dependent on IL-4/IL-13. Thus, helminth 
infection attenuated the Th17 response to MINCLE-dependent immunization in an 
organ- and adjuvant-specific manner via the Th2 cytokines IL-4/IL-13. Taken 
together, our results demonstrate downregulation of MINCLE expression on 
monocytes and macrophages by IL-4 as a possible mechanism of thwarted Th17 
vaccination responses by underlying helminth infection.","© 2023, Schick et al.","DOI: 10.7554/eLife.72923

expressed transcription regulators. Here we show that naive-to-effector 
differentiation was accompanied by dynamic CTCF redistribution and extensive 
chromatin architectural changes. Upon CD8+ T cell activation, CTCF acquired de 
novo binding sites and anchored novel chromatin interactions, and these changes 
were associated with increased chromatin accessibility and elevated expression 
of cytotoxic program genes including Tbx21, Ifng, and Klrg1. CTCF was also 
evicted from its ex-binding sites in naive state, with concomitantly reduced 
chromatin interactions in effector cells, as observed at memory 
precursor-associated genes including Il7r, Sell, and Tcf7. Genetic ablation of 
CTCF indeed diminished cytotoxic gene expression, but paradoxically elevated 
expression of memory precursor genes. Comparative Hi-C analysis revealed that 
key memory precursor genes were harbored within insulated neighborhoods 
demarcated by constitutive CTCF binding, and their induction was likely due to 
disrupted CTCF-dependent insulation. CTCF thus promotes cytotoxic effector 
differentiation by integrating local chromatin accessibility control and 
higher-order genomic reorganization.","This is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection

regulated by adaptive immunity in the composition of Treg-cell subsets and 
T-cell receptors (TCRs). Treg cells are related to most autoimmune diseases, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), RA is 
typically attributed to kidney deficiency (KD) associated with the 
immunosenescence that causes immune dysfunction and the impaired function of 
Treg cells. So far, however, no mechanism related to KD and immune repertoires 
has been identified in RA.
METHODS: Flow cytometry and high-throughput Treg-cell receptor sequencing were 
used to investigate the amount of different Treg-cell subsets and the diversity 
of TCRs between RA patients and healthy subjects, as well as between KD RA and 
non-KD RA patients. RT-qPCR was used to validate the high-throughput sequencing 
results.
RESULTS: The data showed that the amount of naïve Treg cells in KD patients was 
less than in non-KD RA patients (P = 0.004) with no significant differences 
observed between other subsets. In the TCR of Treg cells, the length of 
complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) was low and clonotypes increased in 
the KD group compared with the non-KD group. The diversity and abundance of Treg 
TCRs were low, as determined by the Hill number. In addition, several V(D)J 
combinations, such as T-cell receptor beta variable 7-2 (TRBV7-2), TRBV11-1, 
TRBV13, TRBV15, and TRBJ2-3, varied significantly between the two groups, 
indicating that KD causes Treg dysfunction. RT-qPCR shows that FOXP3 expression 
in peripheral blood Treg is lower in KD than in non-KD.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the close correlation between KD and immune 
repertoires in RA and provide a new evaluation method for RA in TCM.",© 2023 Zhang et al.,"DOI: 10.7717/peerj.14837

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Gadolinium enhancement of spinal nerve roots on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) has rarely been reported in spinal dural arteriovenous fistula 
(SDAVF). Nerve root enhancement and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis can be 
deceptive and lead to a misdiagnosis of myeloradiculitis. We report a patient 
who was initially diagnosed with neurosarcoid myeloradiculitis due to spinal 
nerve root enhancement, mildly inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid, and pulmonary 
granulomas, who ultimately was found to have an extensive symptomatic SDAVF.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old woman presented with a longitudinally extensive 
spinal cord lesion with associated gadolinium enhancement of the cord and cauda 
equina nerve roots, and mild lymphocytic pleocytosis. Pulmonary lymph node 
biopsy revealed non-caseating granulomas and neurosarcoid myeloradiculitis was 
suspected. She had rapid and profound clinical deterioration after a single dose 
of steroids. Further work-up with spinal angiography revealed a thoracic SDAVF, 
which was surgically ligated leading to clinical improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights an unexpected presentation of SDAVF with nerve 
root enhancement and concurrent pulmonary non-caseating granulomas, leading to 
an initial misdiagnosis with neurosarcoidosis. Nerve root enhancement has only 
rarely been described in cases of SDAVF; however, as this case highlights, it is 
an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of non-inflammatory 
causes of longitudinally extensive myeloradiculopathy with nerve root 
enhancement. This point is highly salient due to the importance of avoiding 
misdiagnosis of SDAVF, as interventions such as steroids or epidural injections 
used to treat inflammatory or infiltrative mimics may worsen symptoms in SDAVF. 
We review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of SDAVF as well as a 
proposed diagnostic approach to differentiating SDAVF from inflammatory 
myeloradiculitis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12883-023-03097-7

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Glioma-induced immune dysregulation of the hematopoietic system has 
been described in a limited number of studies. In this study, our group further 
demonstrates that gliomas interrupt the cellular differentiation programming and 
outcomes of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow. 
HSPCs from glioma-bearing mice are reprogrammed and driven towards expansion of 
myeloid lineage precursors and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in 
secondary lymphoid organs. However, we found this expansion is reversed by 
immunotherapy. Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) has been demonstrably efficacious 
in multiple preclinical models of central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, and 
here we describe how glioma-induced dysfunction is reversed by this 
immunotherapeutic platform.
METHODS: The impact of orthotopic KR158B-luc glioma on HSPCs was evaluated in an 
unbiased fashion using single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) of lineage- cells and 
phenotypically using flow cytometry. Mature myeloid cell frequencies and 
function were also evaluated using flow cytometry. Finally, ACT containing total 
body irradiation, tumor RNA-pulsed dendritic cells, tumor-reactive T cells and 
HSPCs isolated from glioma-bearing or non-tumor-bearing mice were used to 
evaluate cell fate differentiation and survival.
RESULTS: Using scRNAseq, we observed an altered HSPC landscape in glioma-bearing 
versus non-tumor-bearing mice . In addition, an expansion of myeloid lineage 
subsets, including granulocyte macrophage precursors (GMPs) and MDSCs, were 
observed in glioma-bearing mice relative to non-tumor-bearing controls. 
Furthermore, MDSCs from glioma-bearing mice demonstrated increased suppressive 
capacity toward tumor-specific T cells as compared with MDSCs from 
non-tumor-bearing hosts. Interestingly, treatment with ACT overcame these 
suppressive properties. When HSPCs from glioma-bearing mice were transferred in 
the context of ACT, we observed significant survival benefit and long-term cures 
in orthotopic glioma models compared with mice treated with ACT using 
non-glioma-bearing HSPCs.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

suggests that peptides from non-canonical (nonC) aberrantly translated proteins 
can be presented on HLA-I by tumor cells. Here, we investigated the 
immunogenicity of nonC tumor HLA-I ligands (nonC-TL) to better understand their 
contribution to cancer immunosurveillance and their therapeutic applicability.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Peptides presented on HLA-I were identified from 9 
patient-derived TCL with melanoma, gynecological, and head and neck cancer 
through proteogenomics. 507 candidate tumor antigens including nonC-TL, 
neoantigens, cancer-germline, or melanocyte differentiation antigens were tested 
for T-cell recognition of pre-existing responses in cancer patients. Donor 
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were in vitro sensitized against 170 selected 
nonC-TL to isolate antigen-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) and evaluate their 
therapeutic potential.
RESULTS: We found no recognition of the 507 nonC-TL tested by autologous ex vivo 
expanded tumor-reactive T-cell cultures while the same cultures demonstrated 
reactivity to mutated, cancer-germline, or melanocyte differentiation antigens. 
However, in vitro sensitization of donor PBL against 170 selected nonC-TL, led 
to the identification of TCRs specific to three nonC-TL, two of which mapped to 
the 5' UTR regions of HOXC13 and ZKSCAN1, and one mapping to a non-coding 
spliced variant of C5orf22C. T cells targeting these nonC-TL recognized cancer 
cell lines naturally presenting their corresponding antigens. Expression of the 
three immunogenic nonC-TL was shared across tumor types and barely or not 
detected in normal cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings predict a limited contribution of nonC-TL to cancer 
immunosurveillance but demonstrate they may be attractive novel targets for 
widely applicable immunotherapies.","DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-3298

objective of this study was to evaluate the mortality rate, survival 
probabilities, and factors associated with death among patients with TB/HIV 
co-infection undergoing TB treatment in Sichuan, China. A retrospective cohort 
study was conducted using the Chinese National TB Surveillance System data of 
TB/HIV co-infected patients enrolled in TB treatment from January 2020 to 
December 2020. We calculated the mortality rate and survival probabilities using 
the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and a Cox proportional hazard model was conducted to 
identify independent risk factors for TB/HIV co-infection mortality. Hazard 
ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were also reported in this 
study. Of 828 TB/HIV co-infected patients, 44 (5.31%) died during TB treatment, 
and the crude mortality rate was 7.76 per 1000 person-months. More than half of 
the deaths (n = 23) occurred in the first 3 months of TB treatment. Overall 
survival probabilities were 97.20%, 95.16%, and 91.75% at 3rd, 6th, and 12th 
month respectively. The independent risk factors for mortality among TB/HIV 
co-infected patients were having extra-pulmonary TB and pulmonary TB 
co-infection, history of antiretroviral therapy interruption, and baseline 
cluster of differentiation 4 T-lymphocyte counts <200 cells/μL at the time of 
HIV diagnosis. Antiretroviral therapy is important for the survival of TB/HIV 
co-infected patients, and it is recommended to help prolong life by restoring 
immune function and preventing extra-pulmonary TB.","Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000032811

inflammation. Two UA forms - monosodium urate (MSU) and soluble uric acid (sUA) 
have been shown to interact physically with inflammasomes, especially with the 
nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), albeit the 
role of the immune response to UA is poorly understood, given that asymptomatic 
hyperuricemia does also exist. Macrophage phagocytosis of UA activate NLRP3, 
lead to cytokines release, and ultimately, lead to chemoattract neutrophils and 
lymphocytes to the gout flare joint spot. Genetic variants of inflammasome genes 
and of genes encoding their molecular partners may influence hyperuricemia and 
gout susceptibility, while also influencing other comorbidities such as 
metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we summarize the 
inflammatory responses in acute and chronic gout, specifically focusing on 
innate immune cell mechanisms and genetic and epigenetic characteristics of 
participating molecules. Unprecedently, a novel UA binding protein - the 
neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP) - is suggested as responsible for 
the asymptomatic hyperuricemia paradox.Abbreviation: β2-integrins:

cell subsets affects post-myocardial infarction repair. However, whether and how 
the tissue environment controls these local immune responses has remained poorly 
understood. We sought to investigate how antigen-specific T-helper cells 
differentiate under myocardial milieu's influence.
METHODS: We used a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR-M) model and major 
histocompatibility complex-II tetramers, both myosin-specific, combined with 
single-cell transcriptomics (single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq]) and 
functional phenotyping to elucidate how the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells 
differentiate in the murine infarcted myocardium and influence tissue repair. 
Additionally, we transferred proinflammatory versus regulatory predifferentiated 
TCR-M-cells to dissect how they specially contribute to post-myocardial 
infarction inflammation.
RESULTS: Flow cytometry and scRNA-/TCR-seq analyses revealed that transferred 
TCR-M cells acquired an induced regulatory phenotype (induced regulatory T cell) 
in the infarcted myocardium and blunted local inflammation. Myocardial TCR-M 
cells differentiated into 2 main lineages enriched with either cell activation 
and profibrotic transcripts (eg, Tgfb1) or suppressor immune checkpoints (eg, 
Pdcd1), which we also found in human myocardial tissue. These cells produced 
high levels of LAP (latency-associated peptide) and inhibited IL-17 
(interleukin-17) responses. Endogenous myosin-specific T-helper cells, 
identified using genetically barcoded tetramers, also accumulated in infarcted 
hearts and exhibited a regulatory phenotype. Notably, TCR-M cells that were 
predifferentiated toward a regulatory phenotype in vitro maintained stable in 
vivo FOXP3 (Forkhead box P3) expression and anti-inflammatory activity whereas 
TH17 partially converted toward a regulatory phenotype in the injured 
myocardium. Overall, the myosin-specific Tregs dampened post-myocardial 
infarction inflammation, suppressed neighboring T cells, and were associated 
with improved cardiac function.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel evidence that the heart and its 
draining lymph nodes actively shape local immune responses by promoting the 
differentiation of antigen-specific Tregs poised with suppressive function.","DOI: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.322183

largest collection of phagocytic cells in the body that detect both pathogens 
that enter through the gut and endogenously produced antigens. This is possible 
by the highly developed differentiation capacity of the liver immune system 
between self-antigens or non-self-antigens, such as food antigens or pathogens. 
As an immune active organ, the liver functions as a gatekeeping barrier from the 
outside world, and it can create a rapid and strong immune response, under 
unfavorable conditions. However, the liver's assumed immune status is 
anti-inflammatory or immuno-tolerant. Dynamic interactions between the numerous 
populations of immune cells in the liver are key for maintaining the delicate 
balance between immune screening and immune tolerance. The anatomical structure 
of the liver can facilitate the preparation of lymphocytes, modulate the immune 
response against hepatotropic pathogens, and contribute to some of its unique 
immunological properties, particularly its capacity to induce antigen-specific 
tolerance. Since liver sinusoidal endothelial cell is fenestrated and lacks a 
basement membrane, circulating lymphocytes can closely contact with antigens, 
displayed by endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and dendritic cells while passing 
through the sinusoids. Loss of immune tolerance, leading to an autoaggressive 
immune response in the liver, if not controlled, can lead to the induction of 
autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases. This review mentions the unique 
features of liver immunity, and dysregulated immune responses in patients with 
autoimmune liver diseases who have a close association with inborn errors of 
immunity have also been the emphases.","©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights

comorbidities. In addition, the development of drugs targeting the underlying 
mechanisms of asthma remains slow. We planned to identify the most upregulated 
differentially expressed long noncoding RNA in asthma to explore its regulatory 
patterns and pathways in asthma.
METHODS: We sensitized mice using a mixture of ovalbumin, house dust mites, and 
lipopolysaccharide to establish an asthma mouse model. We also sensitized asthma 
cells with TGF-β1 in an in vitro model. We performed a microarray analysis to 
identify the lncRNA with the differential expression level in model mice. We 
applied hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stainings to mouse tissues 
to quantify the tissue damage extent. Next, we assess the levels of lncRNA 
CRNDE, miR-29a-3p, TGF-β1, MCL-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, and snail. We counted 
the percentages of Th17 cells using flow cytometry. Finally, we performed a 
dual-luciferase reporter assay to assess the association between lncRNA CRNDE 
and miR-29a-3p.
RESULTS: We successfully established asthma mouse/cell models and selected the 
lncRNA CRNDE for our study. Transfection of si-CRNDE reduced the degree of 
injury and inflammation in the mouse model and reversed the TGF-β1-induced 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the cell model. Moreover, the 
E-cadherin level was upregulated, and the levels of IL-17A, vimentin, snail, and 
α-SMA were downregulated. We also discovered that lncRNA CRNDE negatively 
regulated miR-29a-3p and that this one in turn inhibited MCL-1 in mice. After 
lncRNA CRNDE expression downregulation, the level of miR-29a-3p was increased, 
and we detected reduced levels of MCL-1 and EMTs.
CONCLUSIONS: lncRNA CRNDE expression downregulation led to reduced inflammation 
and reduced lung damage in mice with induced asthma, it inhibited the EMTs of 
lung epithelial cells via the miR-29a-3p/MCL-1 pathway, and it reduced the 
levels of Th17/IL-17A cells to reduce asthma signs.",Copyright © 2023 Yu Yuan et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/2092184

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: To explore the value of integrating clinical and computed tomography 
(CT) features to predict multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-PTB).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 212 patients with MDR-PTB and 180 
patients with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (DS-PTB) who referred to our 
institute in China between January 2016 and March 2021. The clinical and CT 
characteristics were analyzed and compared between both groups. Multivariable 
logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent factors that 
can be used to predict MDR-PTB. Furthermore, 115 patients admitted to another 
center from January 2019 to January 2022 were included as external validation 
cohort.
RESULTS: For clinical characteristics, five parameters were significantly 
different between the two groups (all P < 0.05). With regard to CT features, 
nine parameters were significantly different between the two groups (all P < 
0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis using the aforementioned 
differential features showed that male sex, retreated history, longer duration 
of previous anti-TB treatment, lower CD4+ T lymphocyte count, thick-walled 
cavity, centrilobular micronodules and tree-in-bud sign, bronchial stenosis, 
pleural and pericardial thickening were the most effective variations associated 
with MDR-PTB with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.849 and accuracy of 78.6%. 
Furthermore, the external validation cohort that contains 115 patients obtained 
an AUC of 0.933 and accuracy of 81.7%.
CONCLUSION: MDR-PTB and DS-PTB have different clinical and imaging 
characteristics. A combined model incorporating these differential features can 
promptly diagnose MDR-PTB and develop subsequent therapeutic strategies.",© 2023 Li et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/IDR.S394071

decide the T cell function and anti-tumor ability. However, little is known 
about these alterations in CML patients.
METHOD: Here, we investigated the immunologic phenotypes 
(CD38/CD69/HLA-DR/CD28/CD57/BTLA/TIGIT/PD-1) of T subsets (TN, TCM, TEM, and 
TEMRA) in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) from de novo CML patients 
(DN-CML), patients who achieved a molecular response (MR) and those who failed 
to achieve an MR (TKI-F) after tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment using 
multicolor flow cytometry.
RESULTS: CD38 or HLA-DR positive PB CD8+TN and TCM cells decreased in the DN-CML 
patients and this was further decreased in TKI-F patients. Meanwhile, the level 
of PD-1 elevated in CD8+ TEM and TEMRA cells from PB in all groups. Among BM 
sample, the level of HLA-DR+CD8+TCM cells significantly decreased in all groups 
and CD8+TEMRA cells from TKI-F patients exhibited increased level of TIGIT and 
CD8+ tissue-residual T cells (TRM) from DN-CML patients expressed a higher level 
of PD-1 and TIGIT. Lastly, we found a significantly decreased proportion of 
CD86+ dendritic cells (DCs) and an imbalanced CD80/CD86 in the PB and BM of 
DN-CML patients, which may impair the activation of T cells.
CONCLUSION: In summary, early differentiated TN and TCM cells from CML patients 
may remain in an inadequate activation state, particularly for TKI-F patients. 
And effector T cells (TEM, TEMRA and TRM) may be dysfunctional due to the 
expression of PD-1 and TIGIT in CML patients. Meanwhile, DCs cells exhibited the 
impairment of costimulatory molecule expression in DN-CML patients. Those 
factors may jointly contribute to the immune escape in CML patients.","Copyright © 2023 Yao, Lai, Lu, Zhong, Zha, Huang, Liu, Zeng, Chen, Weng, Du, Li

epidermal hyperplasia and aberrant immune response. In addition to aberrant 
cytokine production, psoriasis is associated with activation of the Akt/mTOR 
pathway. mTOR/S6K1 regulates T-lymphocyte activation and migration, 
keratinocytes proliferation and is upregulated in psoriatic lesions. Several 
drugs that target Th1/Th17 cytokines or their receptors have been approved for 
treating psoriasis in humans with variable results necessitating improved 
therapies. Fisetin, a natural dietary polyphenol with anti-oxidant and 
anti-proliferative properties, covalently binds mTOR/S6K1. The effects of 
fisetin on psoriasis and its underlying mechanisms have not been clearly 
defined. Here, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of fisetin on 
Th1/Th17-cytokine-activated adult human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKa) and 
anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated inflammatory CD4+ T cells and compared these activities 
with those of rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor). Transcriptomic analysis of HEKa 
revealed 12,713 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the fisetin-treated 
group compared to 7,374 DEGs in the rapamycin-treated group, both individually 
compared to a cytokine treated group. Gene ontology analysis revealed enriched 
functional groups related to PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways, psoriasis, and 
epidermal development. Using in silico molecular modeling, we observed a high 
binding affinity of fisetin to IL-17A. In vitro, fisetin significantly inhibited 
mTOR activity, increased the expression of autophagy markers LC3A/B and Atg5 in 
HEKa cells and suppressed the secretion of IL-17A by activated CD4+ T 
lymphocytes or T lymphocytes co-cultured with HEKa. Topical administration of 
fisetin in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse psoriasis model exhibited a better 
effect than rapamycin in reducing psoriasis-like inflammation and Akt/mTOR 
phosphorylation and promoting keratinocyte differentiation and autophagy in mice 
skin lesions. Fisetin also significantly inhibited T-lymphocytes and F4/80+ 
macrophage infiltration into skin. We conclude that fisetin potently inhibits 
IL-17A and the Akt/mTOR pathway and promotes keratinocyte differentiation and 
autophagy to alleviate IMQ-induced psoriasis-like disease in mice. Altogether, 
our findings suggest fisetin as a potential treatment for psoriasis and possibly 
other inflammatory skin diseases.","Copyright © 2023 Roy, Banang-Mbeumi, Boateng, Ruiz, Chamcheu, Kang, King,

(#)Contributed equally","Dendritic cells (DCs) patrol the organism at an immature stage to detect the 
presence of pathogens. Once activated, these mature DCs reach the lymph nodes to 
activate antigen-specific T lymphocytes and thus initiate an adaptative immune 
response to control the pathogen. The migration of both immature and mature DCs 
is a key process for their optimal function. DC migration requires transit 
through narrow constrictions that is allowed by their high local and global 
deformation capabilities. In addition to cytoplasmic changes, the nucleus 
mechanical properties also have a major impact for cellular migration and 
motility. Yet, nucleus intracellular mobility of dendritic cells or its 
variation upon maturation have not been investigated. Our study defines the 
biophysical phenotypic variations of dendritic cells upon maturation using 
interferometric deformability cytometry. This method characterizes different 
cellular mechanical properties, such as elongation and nucleus offset, by 
assessing the refractive index spatial distribution of shear-induced deformed 
cells. By using these parameters, our data suggest that in vitro bone marrow

nucleus mobility, allowing to distinguish immature and mature dendritic cells.

characterised by round lung lesions that correspond to cysts with fine walls, 
which usually contain air. The differential diagnosis of these lesions can be 
challenging, requiring both clinical and radiological perspectives. Entities 
such as pulmonary emphysema and cystic bronchiectasis can simulate cystic 
disease. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the imaging technique of 
choice for the evaluation and diagnosis of cystic lung disease, because it 
confirms the presence of lung disease and establishes the correct diagnosis of 
the associated complications. In many cases, the diagnosis can be established 
based on the HRCT findings, thus making histologic confirmation unnecessary. For 
these reasons, radiologists need to be familiar with the different presentations 
of these entities. A wide variety of diseases are characterised by the presence 
of diffuse pulmonary cysts. Among these, the most common are 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis, which may or may not be associated with tuberous 
sclerosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and lymphocytic interstitial 
pneumonia. Other, less common entities include Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome,

(such as differentiation or tumor-testis antigens) or mutations (both driver and 
passenger mutations), recent results have shown that noncanonical transcripts 
including long noncoding RNAs and transposable elements (TEs) can also encode 
tumor-specific neo-antigens. Here, we investigate the presentation and 
immunogenicity of tumor antigens derived from noncanonical mRNA splicing events 
between coding exons and TEs. Comparing human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
and diverse healthy tissues, we identified a subset of splicing junctions that 
is both tumor specific and shared across patients. We used HLA-I peptidomics to 
identify peptides encoded by tumor-specific junctions in primary NSCLC samples 
and lung tumor cell lines. Recurrent junction-encoded peptides were immunogenic 
in vitro, and CD8+ T cells specific for junction-encoded epitopes were present 
in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes from patients with NSCLC. We conclude 
that noncanonical splicing junctions between exons and TEs represent a source of 
recurrent, immunogenic tumor-specific antigens in patients with NSCLC.","DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.abm6359

hematological malignancy, while the efficacy of CAR-T cell in treating solid 
tumors has been limited due to the exhaustion of CAR-T caused by the tumor 
microenvironment in solid tumors. Therefore, improving the exhaustion of CAR-T 
cell is one of the inspiring strategies for CAR-T treatment of solid tumors. As 
an important regulator in T cell immunity, the transcription factor RUNX3 not 
only negatively regulates the terminal differentiation T-bet gene, reducing the 
ultimate differentiation of T cells, but also increases the residency of T cells 
in non-lymphoid tissues and tumors. By overexpressing RUNX3 in CAR-T cells, we 
found that increasing the expression of RUNX3 maintained the low differentiation 
of CAR-T cells, further improving the exhaustion of CAR-T cells during antigen 
stimulation. In vitro, we found that RUNX3 could reduce the release of cytokines 
while maintaining CAR-T cells function. In re-challenge experiments, CAR-T cells 
overexpressing RUNX3 (Runx3-OE CAR-T) were safer than conventional CAR-T cells, 
while RUNX3 could also maintain the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR-T cells in vivo. 
Collectively, we found that Runx3-OE CAR-T cells can improve CAR-T phenotype and 
reduce cytokines release while maintaining CAR-T cells function, which may 
improve the safety of CAR-T therapy in clinical trials.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business

(VAT) play an important role in inhibiting chronic inflammation and insulin

promote the inhibition of chronic inflammation and insulin resistance remains 
unclear. Here, we investigated the roles of JAZF-1 and PPAR-γ in VAT Treg 
differentiation, inflammation and insulin resistance using a transgenic mouse 
model. First, we determined that the levels of glucose and insulin biochemical 
markers in the JAZF-1 transgenic general feeding or high-fat groups were lower 
than those in the wild-type general feeding or high-fat groups. Second, the 
levels of CD4+ , CD25+ , and FOXP3+ differentiation markers in the JAZF-1 
transgenic general feeding or high-fat groups were significantly higher than 
those in the wild-type groups. PPAR-γ inhibition was associated with low levels 
of CD4+ , CD25+ and FOXP3+ differentiation markers. Third, the levels of TNF-α, 
IL-1β and IL-6 in the JAZF-1 transgenic groups were lower than those in the 
wild-type groups, whereas IL-10 and TGF-β levels were higher in the JAZF-1 
transgenic groups than in the wild-type groups. After using the PPAR-γ 
inhibitor, we observed that TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 increased, while IL-10 and 
TGF-β decreased. We found that JAZF-1 and PPAR-γ could promote Tregs 
differentiation and regulate insulin resistance by synergistically decreasing 
the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and increasing those of IL-10 and

patients initially diagnosed with cutaneous sarcoidosis are found to have an 
asymptomatic disease involving other organ systems. It is the involvement of the

because patients may be asymptomatic, initial presentations may vary, and there

sarcoidosis which led to the diagnosis of stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis in a 
woman in her 50s. Her scar sarcoidosis presented as well-circumscribed, 
reddish-brown macules surrounding an atrophic scar from a prior skin graft on 
the right leg. Biopsy revealed scattered, well-formed, non-necrotizing 
granulomas of the dermis composed of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated 
giant cells, surrounded by a sparse infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes. A 
CT chest demonstrated extensive hilar lymphadenopathy, leading to a diagnosis of

the interesting presentation of scar sarcoidosis and underscores the importance

model resemble tumor-infiltrating exhausted T cells on a phenotypic and

CD8 T cells decreases PLCγ1, Ca2+, and NFATc2-mediated T cell signaling and 
reduces expression of NR4A1/3 and TOX. SNX9 knockout enhances memory

well understood. Here we show that, although naive T cells are rich in 
polyunsaturated phosphoinositides (PIPn with 3-4 double bonds), Teff cells have 
unique PIPn marked by saturated fatty acyl chains (0-2 double bonds). PIPn are 
precursors for second messengers. Polyunsaturated phosphatidylinositol 
bisphosphate (PIP2) exclusively supported signaling immediately upon T cell 
antigen receptor activation. In late Teff cells, activity of phospholipase C-γ1, 
the enzyme that cleaves PIP2 into downstream mediators, waned, and saturated 
PIPn became essential for sustained signaling. Saturated PIP was more rapidly 
converted to PIP2 with subsequent recruitment of phospholipase C-γ1, and loss of 
saturated PIPn impaired Teff cell fitness and function, even in cells with 
abundant polyunsaturated PIPn. Glucose was the substrate for de novo PIPn 
synthesis, and was rapidly utilized for saturated PIP2 generation. Thus, 
separate PIPn pools with distinct acyl chain compositions and metabolic 
dependencies drive important signaling events to initiate and then sustain 
effector function during CD8+ T cell differentiation.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","DOI: 10.1038/s41590-023-01419-y

absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells with Th17 differentiation in peripheral 
blood prior to therapy, and that gastrointestinal tissues from patients with 
active autoimmune complications of PI3Kδ inhibitors show infiltration with 
Th17+ T cells. These same tissues show depletion of Tregs as compared to CLL 
patients without toxicity, suggesting that loss of Tregs may be permissive for 
Th17 activation to lead to autoimmune toxicity. Clinical trials to restore this 
balance are warranted.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41408-023-00788-9

in a murine model of acute colitis induced by sodium dextran sulfate, as well as 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans. However, the mechanisms and 
functions of APL/APJ axis in the pathogenesis of IBD are unclear. We herein 
analyzed CD4+ T cells to determine the functions of APL in a murine model of 
chronic colitis induced in Rag deficient mice (Rag-/-). In colonic tissues of 
wild-type mice (WT), we found that APL was expressed especially in the lamina 
propria lymphocytes, where CD4+ T cells are dominant, rather than the epithelial 
cells. Unexpectedly, the APL expression was rather downregulated in the colonic 
tissue of the chronic colitis group compared to the control groups (Rag-/- 
before colitis induction and WT). The APL expression was downregulated when 
naïve T cells were differentiated into effecter T cells. A lack of APL resulted 
in decreased naïve T cells and increased effecter T cells in secondary lymphoid 
organs. A synthetic APL peptide, [Pyr1]-APL-13, increased IL-10 and decreased 
IFN-γ productions by effecter T cells. Administration of [Pyr1]-APL-13 improved 
survival rate in association with lessened colitis severity and decreased 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This is the first report showing 
immunological function of APL specifically on T cells, and these results 
indicate that APL/APJ axis may be a novel therapeutic target for IBD.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.01.068

sepsis and is closely associated with poor outcomes. The novel role of the 
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-35 in sepsis was examined. Methods: Sepsis was 
induced by in C57BL/6 mice cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The impacts of 
IL-35 on effector CD4 + T cells were investigated by examining cell 
proliferation and the Th1/Th2 ratio in the presence of recombinant IL-35 
(rIL-35) or anti-IL-35 (EBI3). The regulatory effect of IL-35 on autophagy was 
evaluated by measuring autophagy markers and autophagic flux in CLP mice in vivo 
and in activated effector CD4 + T cells in vitro . Results: IL-35 levels were 
significantly increased in the serum and spleens of septic mice. rIL-35 
administration after CLP further decreased proliferation and the Th1/Th2 ratio 
in effector CD4 + T cells and significantly shortened the survival time. 
Sepsis-induced autophagy activation was protective in effector CD4 + T cells and 
was blocked by rIL-35. The inhibitory effect of IL-35 on autophagy was observed 
in activated effector CD4 + T cells in vitro , and this effect was mediated by 
restricting high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) translocation. Conclusion: 
IL-35 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that impairs CD4 + T-cell proliferation 
and differentiation in sepsis, and the effect might be mediated by reducing 
HMGB1-dependent autophagy.",Copyright © 2022 by the Shock Society.,"DOI: 10.1097/SHK.0000000000001990

radiotherapy, but its mechanism in radiotherapy still needs to be further 
explored. The active ingredients of Ginseng were analyzed according to 
pharmacodynamics in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology 
Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) database, and the target genes of active 
ingredients were screened by UniProt, PubChem and Swiss target prediction 
database. The differentially expressed genes of GSE6871 and GSE20162 were 
analyzed from the GEO database. Further, cluster analysis and enrichment 
analysis were carried out through protein-protein interaction network to 
determine hub gene. Next, build the drug-disease target network, conduct 
molecular docking simulation, and determine the key ingredients and targets of 
Ginseng on radiotherapy. We screened 16 active ingredients of Ginseng and 747 
target genes from the TCMSP database. Eighty-two common differentially expressed 
genes were obtained by the GEO database. After topological analysis, we finally 
determined CD28, FYN, IL2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK), MYC and CD247 as hub 
genes. After integrating the drug-disease target network and molecular docking, 
we found that Panaxadiol, as an active ingredient of Ginseng, can target ITK to 
participate in T cell signal receptor pathway and act on radiotherapy. 
Panaxadiol can act on the key target ITK of radiotherapy, participate in T cell 
signal receptor pathway, and then affect the proliferation, differentiation and 
immune response of radiotherapy T cells, so as to reduce the side effects of 
radiotherapy.","Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000001448

with an increased incidence of obesity, metabolic syndromes such as type 2 
diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune diseases including 
inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. All these diseases have an 
inflammatory component, of which T lymphocytes can play a critical role in 
driving. Much has been learned regarding the importance of sugar, particularly 
glucose, in fueling effector versus regulatory T cells that can promote or 
dampen inflammation, respectively. In particular, glucose and its metabolic 
breakdown products via glycolysis are essential for effector T cell 
differentiation and function, while fatty acid-fueled oxidative phosphorylation 
supports homeostasis and function of regulatory T cells. Nevertheless, a 
critical knowledge gap, given the prevalence of diabetes in Western societies, 
is the impact of elevated glucose concentrations on the balance between effector 
versus regulatory T cells. To begin addressing this, we cultured naïve CD4+ T 
cells with different concentrations of glucose, and examined their 
differentiation into effector versus regulatory lineages. Surprisingly, high 
glucose promoted regulatory T cell differentiation and inhibited Th1 effector 
differentiation. This skewing towards the regulatory lineage occurred via an 
indirect mechanism that depends on lactate produced by activated glycolytic T 
cells. Addition of lactate to the T cell differentiation process promotes the 
differentiation of Treg cells, and activates Akt/mTOR signaling cascade. Hence, 
our findings suggest the existence of a novel feedback mechanism in which 
lactate produced by activated, differentiating T cells skews their lineage 
commitment towards the regulatory fate.","Copyright: © 2023 Pitmon et al. This is an open access article distributed under

with only a minority demonstrating plasmacytic differentiation. However, like 
primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoproliferative disorders (PCMZLPD), thyroid 
MALT lymphomas (T-MALT-L) frequently show plasmacytic differentiation and IgG 
positivity. Whether T-MALT-L share other features with PCMZLPD, including 
frequent IgG4 positivity and infrequent IRTA1 expression, and how IRTA1 staining 
compares to that in Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) are unknown. Therefore, the 
clinicopathologic features of 18 T-MALT-L were assessed, and their IRTA1 
expression compared with that in 5 HT cases. All T-MALT-L cases included a 
B-lymphoid component. Plasmacytic differentiation was present in 15 cases and 
was extensive in 12. Fourteen cases were IgG+ including 2 IgG4+ (12 κ+, 2 
κ-/λ-). One case was IgAλ+. Plasmacytic cells were uniformly CD19+/CD56- but 
CD138- in 7/15 cases. IRTA1+ cells were present in 16/16 cases, ranging from 
scattered cells to >50%. They were often concentrated in ""MALT ball""-type 
lymphoepithelial lesions, perifollicular regions, and sometimes in germinal 
centers. IRTA1 positivity was also present in all HT cases, although it was 
never very extensive and often had a perifollicular distribution, occasionally 
with sparse aggregates and positive cells within rare thyroid follicles. Thus, 
T-MALT-L share some features with PCMZLPD but are more similar to noncutaneous 
MALT lymphomas, with prominent lymphoepithelial lesions, ubiquitous although 
variable IRTA1 positivity, and infrequent IgG4 positivity. Plasmacytic 
differentiation is also common although CD138 loss is frequent and light chain 
staining may be absent. IRTA1 staining may help in the differential diagnosis 
with HT, although there is some overlap in staining patterns.","Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000002005

atherosclerosis and leukemia and worse survival among patients with cancer; 
however, the association with cancer therapy efficacy, in particular immune 
checkpoint blockade (ICB), and toxicity has not yet been established. Given the 
widespread use of ICB and the critical role hematopoietic stem cell-derived 
lymphocytes play in mediating antitumor responses, CH may be associated with 
therapeutic efficacy and hematologic toxicity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between CH and outcomes, hematologic 
toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal 
tract cancers being treated with systemic therapy, both in the first-line 
metastatic treatment setting and in ICB.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 633 
patients with stage IV colorectal (CRC) and esophagogastric (EGC) cancer who 
were treated with first-line chemotherapy and/or ICB at Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center. Patients underwent matched tumor and peripheral blood DNA 
sequencing using the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of 
Actionable Cancer Targets next-generation sequencing assay between January 1, 
2006, and December 31, 2020.
EXPOSURES: Clonal hematopoiesis-related genetic alterations were identified by 
next-generation sequencing of patients' tumor and normal blood buffy coat 
samples, with a subset of these CH alterations annotated as likely putative 
drivers (CH-PD) based upon previously established criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients with CH and CH-PD in peripheral blood 
samples were identified, and these findings were correlated with survival 
outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) during 
first-line chemotherapy and ICB, as well as baseline white blood cell levels and 
the need for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.
RESULTS: Among the 633 patients included in the study (390 men [61.6%]; median 
age, 58 [IQR, 48-66] years), the median age was 52 (IQR, 45-63) years in the CRC 
group and 61 (IQR, 53-69) years in the EGC group. In the CRC group, 161 of 301 
patients (53.5%) were men, compared with 229 of 332 patients (69.0%) in the EGC 
group. Overall, 62 patients (9.8%) were Asian, 45 (7.1%) were Black or African 
American, 482 (76.1%) were White, and 44 (7.0%) were of unknown race or 
ethnicity. Presence of CH was identified in 115 patients with EGC (34.6%) and 83 
with CRC (27.6%), with approximately half of these patients harboring CH-PD (CRC 
group, 44 of 83 [53.0%]; EGC group, 55 of 115 [47.8%]). Patients with EGC and 
CH-PD exhibited a significantly worse median OS of 16.0 (95% CI, 11.6-22.3) 
months compared with 21.6 (95% CI, 19.6-24.3) months for those without CH-PD 
(P = .01). For patients with CRC and EGC, CH and CH-PD were not associated with 
PFS differences in patients undergoing ICB or first-line chemotherapy. Neither 
CH nor CH-PD were correlated with baseline leukocyte levels or increased need 
for G-CSF support.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest CH and CH-PD are not directly 
associated with the treatment course of patients with metastatic 
gastrointestinal tract cancer receiving cancer-directed therapy.","DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.54221

(#)Contributed equally","Gastric cancers are highly heterogeneous malignant tumors. To reveal the 
relationship between differentiation status of cancer cells and tumor immune 
microenvironments in gastric cancer, single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on 
normal mucosa tissue, differentiated gastric cancer (DGC) tissue, poorly 
differentiated gastric cancer (PDGC) tissue and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) 
tissue sampled from surgically resected gastric cancer specimens. We identified 
the signature genes for both DGC and PDGC, and found that signature genes of 
PDGC strongly enriched in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. 
Furthermore, we found that DGC tends to be immune-rich type whereas PDGC tends 
to be immune-poor type defined according to the density of tumor-infiltrating 
CD8+ T cells. Additionally, interferon alpha and gamma responding genes were 
specifically expressed in the immune-rich malignant cells compared with 
immune-poor malignant cells. Through analyzing the mixed adenoneuroendocrine 
carcinoma, we identified intermediate state malignant cells during the 
trans-differentiation process from DGC to NEC, which showed double-negative 
expressions of both DGC marker genes and NEC marker genes. Interferon-related 
pathways were gradually downregulated along the DGC to NEC trans-differentiation 
path, which was accompanied by reduced CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell infiltration. In 
summary, molecular features of both malignant cells and immune microenvironment 
cells of DGC, PDGC and NEC were systematically revealed, which may partially 
explain the strong tumor heterogeneities of gastric cancer. Especially along the 
DGC to NEC trans-differentiation path, immune-evasion was gradually enhanced 
with the decreasing activities of interferon pathway responses in malignant 
cells.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00018-023-04702-1

associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Prognostic models of ACLF 
have been developed; however, few studies have focused on the occurrence of 
ACLF. This study aimed to identify the factors that predict the development of 
ACLF, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and infection in patients with cirrhosis.
METHODS: Patients with cirrhosis were enrolled, and the serum levels of 
calcitriol, Cluster of Differentiation 26 (CD206), and macrophage-inducible 
lectin receptor (Mincle) were measured, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) 
and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were calculated; all the patients were 
tracked for 6 months. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to assess 
the factors associated with ACLF development, HE, and infection. The 
aforementioned model was derived based on immunological markers, and receiver 
operating characteristic analysis with area under the curve (AUC) was adopted to 
evaluate accuracy.
RESULTS: After screening 325 patients with cirrhosis, 65 patients were eligible. 
In the GEE model, low levels of calcitriol (odds ratio [OR] = 3.259; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 1.118-8.929) and CD206 (OR = 2.666; 95% CI = 
1.082-6.567) were associated with the development of ACLF, and the LMR was a 
protective factor (OR = 0.356; 95% CI = 0.147-0.861). Low calcitriol levels were 
a risk factor for HE (OR = 3.827) and infection (OR = 2.489). LMR was found to 
be a protective factor against HE (OR = 0.388). An immunological model for the 
discrimination of ACLF development within 6 months was proposed, with an AUC of 
0.734 (95% CI = 0.598-0.869).
CONCLUSION: Single and combined immunological markers, including low LMR and low 
levels of calcitriol and CD206, were promising for early prediction of the 
development of ACLF, HE, and infection in patients with cirrhosis.","Copyright © 2023, the Chinese Medical Association.","DOI: 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000867

characterised by excessive extracellular matrix deposition in the skin and 
internal organs. B cell infiltration into lesional sites such as the alveolar 
interstitium and small blood vessels, alongside the production of defined 
clinically relevant autoantibodies indicates that B cells play a fundamental 
role in the pathogenesis and development of SSc. This is supported by B cell and 
fibroblast coculture experiments revealing that B cells directly enhance 
collagen and extracellular matrix synthesis in fibroblasts. In addition, B cells 
from SSc patients produce large amounts of profibrotic cytokines such as IL-6 
and TGF-β, which interact with other immune and endothelial cells, promoting the 
profibrotic loop. Furthermore, total B cell counts are increased in SSc patients 
compared with healthy donors and specific differences can be found in the 
content of naïve, memory, transitional and regulatory B cell compartments. B 
cells from SSc patients also show differential expression of activation markers 
such as CD19 which may shape interactions with other immune mediators such as T 
follicular helper cells and dendritic cells. The key role of B cells in SSc is 
further supported by the therapeutic benefit of B cell depletion with rituximab 
in some patients. It is notable also that B cell signaling is impaired in SSc 
patients, and this could underpin the failure to induce tolerance in B cells as 
has been shown in murine models of scleroderma.","Copyright © 2023 Beesley, Goldman, Taher, Denton, Abraham, Mageed and Ong.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.999008

(TB-IRIS) is a frequent complication of cotreatment for TB and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. We characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(Mtb)-specific CD4 T-cell phenotype and transcription factor profile associated 
with the development of TB-IRIS.
METHODS: We examined the role of CD4 T-cell transcription factors in a murine 
model of mycobacterial IRIS. In humans, we used a longitudinal study design to 
compare the magnitude of antiretroviral therapy, activation, transcription 
factor profile, and cytotoxic potential of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells between 
TB-IRIS (n = 25) and appropriate non-IRIS control patients (n = 18) using flow 
cytometry.
RESULTS: In the murine model, CD4 T-cell expression of Eomesodermin (Eomes), but 
not Tbet, was associated with experimentally induced IRIS. In patients, TB-IRIS 
onset was associated with the expansion of Mtb-specific IFNγ+CD4 T cells (P = 
.039). Patients with TB-IRIS had higher HLA-DR expression (P = .016), but no 
differences in the expression of T-bet or Eomes were observed. At TB-IRIS onset, 
Eomes+Tbet+Mtb-specific IFNγ+CD4+ T cells showed higher expression of granzyme B 
in patients with TB-IRIS (P = .026).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the murine model of Mycobacterium avium complex-IRIS 
suggests that Eomes+CD4 T cells underly IRIS, TB-IRIS was not associated with 
Eomes expression in patients. Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific IFNγ+CD4 
T-cell responses in TB-IRIS patients are differentiated, highly activated, and 
potentially cytotoxic.","© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of

strategy in bladder cancer. However, treatment responses vary, and improved 
biomarkers are needed. Crucially, the characteristics of immune cells remain 
understudied especially in squamous differentiated bladder cancer (sq-BLCA). 
Here, we quantitatively analysed the tumour-immune phenotypes of sq-BLCA and 
correlated them with PD-L1 expression and FGFR3 mutation status.
METHODS: Tissue microarrays (TMA) of n = 68 non-schistosomiasis associated pure 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and n = 46 mixed urothelial carcinoma with 
squamous differentiation (MIX) were subjected to immunohistochemistry for CD3, 
CD4, CD8, CD56, CD68, CD79A, CD163, Ki67, perforin and chloroacetate esterase 
staining. Quantitative image evaluation was performed via digital image 
analysis.
RESULTS: Immune infiltration was generally higher in stroma than in tumour 
regions. B-cells (CD79A) were almost exclusively found in stromal areas (sTILs), 
T-lymphocytes and macrophages were also present in tumour cell areas (iTILs), 
while natural killer cells (CD56) were nearly missing in any area. Tumour-immune 
phenotype distribution differed depending on the immune cell subset, however, 
hot tumour-immune phenotypes (high density of immune cells in tumour areas) were 
frequently found for CD8 + T-cells (33%), especially perforin + lymphocytes 
(52.2%), and CD68 + macrophages (37.6%). Perforin + CD8 lymphocytes predicted 
improved overall survival in sq-BLCA while high PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 10) was 
significantly associated with higher CD3 + , CD8 + and CD163 + immune cell 
density and high Ki67 (density) of tumour cells. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression 
was positively associated with CD3 + /CD4 + , CD3 + /CD8 + and 
CD68 + /CD163 + hot tumour-immune phenotypes. FGFR3 mutation status was 
inversely associated with CD8 + , perforin + and CD79A + lymphocyte density.
CONCLUSIONS: Computer-based image analysis is an efficient tool to analyse 
immune topographies in squamous bladder cancer. Hot tumour-immune phenotypes 
with strong PD-L1 expression might pose a promising subgroup for clinically 
successful ICI therapy in squamous bladder cancer and warrant further 
investigation.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-10576-0

antigen-specific immune responses. In the pre-existing models, a monoclonal TCR 
is driven by a non-physiologic promoter and randomly integrated into the genome. 
Here, we create a highly efficient methodology to develop T cell receptor 
exchange (TRex) mice, in which TCRs, specific to the self/tumor antigen 
mesothelin (Msln), are integrated into the Trac locus, with concomitant Msln 
disruption to circumvent T cell tolerance. We show that high affinity TRex 
thymocytes undergo all sequential stages of maturation, express the exogenous 
TCR at DN4, require MHC class I for positive selection and undergo negative 
selection only when both Msln alleles are present. By comparison of TCRs with 
the same specificity but varying affinity, we show that Trac targeting improves 
functional sensitivity of a lower affinity TCR and confers resistance to T cell 
functional loss. By generating P14 TRex mice with the same specificity as the 
widely used LCMV-P14 TCR transgenic mouse, we demonstrate increased avidity of 
Trac-targeted TCRs over transgenic TCRs, while preserving physiologic T cell 
development. Together, our results support that the TRex methodology is an 
advanced tool to study physiological antigen-specific T cell behavior.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-36180-1

such as respiratory failure, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction, or other 
need for intensive care management, which are associated with high risk of 
mortality. It is essential to differentiate the severity of H1N1 pneumonia and 
take corresponding target treatments.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the differences in clinical characteristics 
and chest computed tomography (CT) findings between severe and critical patients 
with H1N1 pneumonia.
METHODS: A total of 27 patients diagnosed with H1N1 pneumonia from October 2018 
to March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed, and the differences in clinical 
manifestations, laboratory tests, and chest CT findings between the severe group 
(15 patients) and the critical group (12 patients) were compared.
RESULTS: Frequency of dyspnea at rest was higher in critical group than that in 
severe group (P = 0.019). The neutrophil percentage was higher (P = 0.014) and 
the lymphocyte percentage was lower (P = 0.025) in critical compared with severe 
group. Bilateral lung involvement was the predominant pattern in both severe and 
critical patients, whereas the number of involved lobes in critical patients was 
more than that in severe patients (P = 0.024). Peripheral distribution was the 
predominant pattern in severe patients (40%), whereas more diffuse involvement 
of the lungs was observed in critical patients (83.30%). Ground-glass opacities 
and consolidation were the main CT findings in both groups, and prevalence of 
consolidation was higher in critical relative to severe group (83.30%).
CONCLUSION: Compared with severe patients, those with critical H1N1 pneumonia 
were more likely to present with dyspnea at rest and decreased lymphocyte 
percentage. Chest CT showed that diffuse bilateral involvement and higher 
prevalence of consolidation are associated with critical outcomes.","© 2023 The Authors. The Clinical Respiratory Journal published by John Wiley &

adhesion and cell signaling protein. Signaling through Ly-6A activates the 
cell-intrinsic apoptotic cell death pathway in CD4+ T cell lines, as indicated 
by the release of cytochrome C, and activation of caspases 9 and 3. In addition, 
Ly-6A induces cytokine production and growth inhibition. The mechanism 
underlying the distinct cellular responses that are triggered by engaging Ly-6A 
protein has remained unknown. To examine the relatedness of these distinct 
responses, we have quantified the production of pro-apoptotic, growth inhibitory 
and tumor suppressive cytokines, such as TNF-α, TGF-β and a related protein 
GDF-10, in response to Ly-6A signaling. Anti-Ly-6A monoclonal antibody-induced 
activation of YH16.33 CD4+ T cell line generated low levels of TGF-β and GDF-10 
but elevated levels of TNF-α. Blocking the biological activity of TNF-α resulted 
in reduced Ly-6A-induced apoptosis in T cells. The Ly-6A-induced response in the 
T cell line was distinct, as signaling through the antigen receptor complex did 
not cause growth inhibition and apoptosis despite high levels of TGF-β and 
GDF-10 that were detected in these cultures. Additionally, in response to 
antigen receptor complex signaling, lower amount of TNF-α was detected. These 
results indicate the contribution of TNF-α in the observed Ly-6A-induced growth 
inhibition and apoptosis and provide a mechanistic explanation for the 
biologically distinct responses observed in CD4+ T cells after engaging Ly-6A 
protein. Additionally, the findings reported here will aid in the understanding 
of inhibitory signaling initiated by Ly-6A protein, especially in the context of 
its potential immune checkpoint inhibitory role in T cells.","© 2023. L. Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Wroclaw,

tumors, NK cells must be modified to resist exhaustion in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). However, the molecular checkpoint underlying NK cell 
exhaustion in the TME remains elusive.
METHODS: We analyzed the correlation between TIPE2 expression and NK cell 
functional exhaustion in the TME both in humans and mice by single-cell 
transcriptomic analysis and by using gene reporter mice. We investigated the 
effects of TIPE2 deletion on adoptively transferred NK cell therapy against 
cancers by using NK cells from NK-specific Tipe2-deficient mice or peripheral 
blood-derived or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human NK cells 
with TIPE2 deletion by CRISPR/Cas9. We also investigated the potential synergy 
of double deletion of TIPE2 and another checkpoint molecule, CISH.
RESULTS: By single-cell transcriptomic analysis and by using gene reporter mice, 
we found that TIPE2 expression correlated with NK cell exhaustion in the TME 
both in humans and mice and that the TIPE2 high NK cell subset correlated with 
poorer survival of tumor patients. TIPE2 deletion promoted the antitumor 
activity of adoptively transferred mouse NK cells and adoptively transferred 
human NK cells, either derived from peripheral blood or differentiated from 
iPSCs. TIPE2 deletion rendered NK cells with elevated capacities for tumor 
infiltration and effector functions. TIPE2 deletion also synergized with CISH 
deletion to further improve antitumor activity in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted TIPE2 targeting as a promising approach for 
enhancing adoptive NK cell therapy against solid tumors.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

(1)From the Departments of Radiology.","OBJECTIVES: Patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
(eosCRSwNP) usually have more extensive sinus disease, severe symptoms, and 
poorer disease control compared with patients with non-eosCRSwNP. Separating 
these entities will be crucial for patient management. The purpose of this study 
is to investigate T 1, T 2 , and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of 
the nasal polyps in patients with CRSwNP and evaluate the usefulness of these 
parameters for differentiating these diseases.
METHODS: Sinonasal magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 36 patients with 
eosCRSwNP and 20 patients with non-eosCRSwNP (including T 1 mapping, T 2 
mapping, and diffusion-weighted imaging) before surgery. The T 1 , T 2 , and ADC 
values were calculated and correlated with pathologically assessed inflammatory 
cells of nasal polyps.
RESULTS: Significant higher T 2 value, higher eosinophil count, and lower 
lymphocyte count of the nasal polyps were observed in eosCRSwNP than those in 
non-eosCRSwNP. There was no significant difference in T 1 or ADC values between 
the 2 groups. T 2 value was correlated with eosinophil count and lymphocyte 
count in CRSwNP. The area under the curve of T 2 value for predicting eosCRSwNP 
was 0.78 with 89.9% sensitivity and 60.0% specificity.
CONCLUSION: T 2 value is a promising imaging biomarker for predicting eosCRSwNP. 
It can help to distinguish eosCRSwNP from non-eosCRSwNP.","Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/RCT.0000000000001411

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study included 77 HIV-positive 
patients with lung pathology. The 1st group consisted of 44 HIV-infected 
patients with BP; the 2nd group - of 33 patients with HIV/TB co-infection. Level 
of SSM, CD4+ T-lymphocytes, HIV-1 RNA viral load was determined. Сlinical,

were used in the research.
RESULTS: Results: In patients with HIV/TB co-infection CD4+ T-lymphocyte level 
was lower, and viral load was higher than in HIV-infected patients with BP. The 
level of SSM was statistically significantly elevated in patients of both groups 
compared with the control (p<0,001), but in patients with HIV/TB co-infection 
the values were statistically significantly higher (p<0,001). In patients with 
BP, the content of SSM≤15,95 TU occurred statistically significantly more often 
than in patients with TB (χ2= 65,5; p <0,001). No statistically significant 
relationship between SSM content and CD4+ T-lymphocyte levels was found.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The content of SSM in patients with HIV/TB co-infection 
is statistically significantly higher than in the group of HIV-infected patients 
with BP. Determination of SSM level can be used as a rapid method of 
differential diagnosis of BP and TB in HIV-positive patients that will allow to 
optimize the diagnostic algorithm at the early stage of hospitalization and to 
receive the necessary timely treatment for HIV-infected patients.","DOI: 10.36740/WLek202212124

series of checkpoints: T-lineage commitment, T-cell receptor (TCR)β selection,

drive differentiation along the T-lineage trajectory, through mechanisms that

fetal T-cell development differs from adult in ways that suggest that these TF 
mechanisms are not fully deterministic. The first wave of fetal T-cell 
differentiation occurs during a unique developmental window during thymic 
morphogenesis, shows more rapid kinetics of differentiation with fewer rounds of 
cell division, and gives rise to unique populations of innate lymphoid cells

the characteristic kinetics and progeny biases are cell-intrinsic properties of

of bovines that inflicts heavy losses in affected livestock farms. Genetic 
variations contribute substantially to the inter-individual differences in the 
immune response against disease agents. The present study aimed to evaluate the 
genetic basis of differential immune response in Vrindavani cattle by comparing 
the hematological, biochemical and cytokine genes' expression profiles of 
LSD-affected and unaffected animals. After 21 days of the outbreak at the farm, 
the animals were grouped as affected (those who developed symptoms) and 
unaffected/healthy (those who did not). Standard hematological and biochemical 
parameters were evaluated in both the groups. Expression profiling of important 
Th1 (IL2, INFG and GMCSF) and Th2 (IL4, IL6 and IL10) cytokines was also 
performed via a relative quantification approach using real-time PCR. 
Erythrogram and leucogram analyses revealed significant differences in total 
leucocyte count (TLC: 14.18 ± 0.74 versus 11.38 ± 0.68 x103/µL), hemoglobin (Hb: 
8.66 ± 0.42 versus 10.84 ± 0.17 g%) and percentage of neutrophils (46.40 ± 1.98 
versus 35.40 ± 2.11%), lymphocytes (49.40 ± 1.99 versus 62.40 ± 1.86) and 
monocytes (4.20 ± 0.37 versus 2.40 ± 0.40) between the affected and healthy 
animals, respectively. The production of liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT) was 
significantly higher in affected animals (74.18 ± 4.76 and 59.51 ± 2.75) when 
compared to the healthy counterparts (65.95 ± 9.18 and 39.21 ± 3.31). The 
expression profiling of Th1 and Th2 cytokines revealed significant differences 
between the two groups, except IL10. The expression of IL2, GMCSF and IL6 were 
upregulated in healthy animals while that of INFG, IL4 and IL10 were upregulated 
in LSD-affected animals. The highest abundance was observed for IL2 transcripts 
in healthy animals among all assessed cytokines with log2fold change of 1.61 as 
compared to affected counterparts. Overall, the immune response in healthy 
animals (after exposure to LSD virus) was predominated by the expression of Th1 
cell proliferation and there was an increased production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines as compared to the affected counterparts. The results revealed that 
the effective immune response to LSD in cattle consists of changes in 
hematological and biochemical parameters and altered expression profile of 
cytokines with enhanced phagocytosis and lymphocyte recruitment. Furthermore, 
optimal expression of Th1 cytokines is required for maintaining optimal health 
against infectious insult with LSD virus in cattle.","© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2023, Springer Nature or its

the present study, its effects were investigated on dendritic cells (DCs) 
stimulated with a tumor antigen (MAGE-1) and retinoic acid (RA) and on T 
lymphocytes to observe a possible differential activation of T lymphocytes, 
driving preferentially to Th1 or Treg cells.
METHODS: Cell viability, lymphocyte proliferation, gene expression (T-bet and

production and induced a higher lymphoproliferation compared to control, while 
MAGE-1 + propolis induced IL-6 production. Propolis in combination with RA

recipient tissues, causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality. A central question has been how GVHD is sustained 
despite T cell exhaustion from chronic antigen stimulation. The current model 
for GVHD holds that disease is maintained through the continued recruitment of 
alloreactive effectors from blood into affected tissues. Here, we show, using 
multiple approaches including parabiosis of mice with GVHD, that GVHD is instead 
primarily maintained locally within diseased tissues. By tracking 1,203 
alloreactive T cell clones, we fitted a mathematical model predicting that 
within each tissue a small number of progenitor T cells maintain a larger 
effector pool. Consistent with this, we identified a tissue-resident TCF-1+ 
subpopulation that preferentially engrafted, expanded, and differentiated into 
effectors upon adoptive transfer. These results suggest that therapies targeting 
affected tissues and progenitor T cells within them would be effective.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.immuni.2023.01.003

immune system and the nutritional status of patients, and prognosis in various 
cancers. However, the HALP score in hepatocellular carcinoma has not been 
reported.
METHODS: Data were analyzed retrospectively from Child-Pugh A patients 
undergoing hepatic resection for single hepatocellular carcinoma ≤5 cm. For 
cross-validation, patients were divided into the training (332 patients) and 
validation cohort (210 patients). In the training cohort, we divided patients 
into two groups by appropriate cut-off value of the HALP score, and univariable 
and multivariable analyses were conducted for disease-free and overall survival 
(OS) between two groups. In the validation cohort, we examined OS by 
Kaplan-Meier analysis in the same cut-off value of the HALP score in the 
training cohort.
RESULTS: The HALP-low group was significantly older (p = 0.0003), had fewer 
hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients (p = 0.0369), higher prothrombin 
time (p = 0.0141), lower fibrosis-4 index (p = 0.0206), bigger maximum tumor 
size (p = 0.0196), and less histological liver fibrosis (p = 0.0077). 
Multivariate analysis showed that the independent prognostic factors for 
disease-free survival were fibrosis-4 index ≥2.67 (p = 0.0008), simple nodular 
type with extranodular growth or confluent multinodular type (p = 0.0221), and 
intrahepatic metastasis (p = 0.0233), and that for OS were fibrosis-4 index 
≥2.67 (p = 0.0020), HALP ≤45.6 (p = 0.0228), and poor differentiation 
(p = 0.0305). In the validation cohort, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed the trend 
toward significantly impaired OS (p = 0.0220) in the HALP-low group.

METHODS: We reviewed the clinicopathological data of 480 patients with gastric 
cancer undergoing curative laparoscopic gastrectomy between 2009 and 2019. This 
study examined the significance of LMR, NLR, PLR, and ICPI as cancer-specific

RESULTS: In univariate analysis, tumor diameter, histological differentiation, 
pathological tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) stage, LMR, NLR, PLR, C-reactive 
protein (CRP) level, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and postoperative 
chemotherapy were significantly associated with CSS. In multivariate analysis, 
pTNM stage and CEA were the independent risk factors for CSS, although LMR, NLR, 
and PLR were not the independent risk factors for CSS. The ICPI formula was 
constructed using hazard ratios for three inflammation-based biomarkers with 
worse prognosis identified in the univariate analysis: LMR <4.315, NLR ≥2.344, 
and PLR ≥212.01, which were each scored as 1, with all remaining values pointed 
at 0. ICPI was calculated as follows: ICPI = 2.9 × LMR + 2.8 × NLR + 2.8 × PLR. 
The optimal cutoff value of ICPII was 2.9. On multivariate analysis, pTNM stage, 
CEA, and ICPI were independent prognostic factors for CSS. In the Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis, CSS in the high ICPI group was significantly worse than that 
in the low ICPI group.

aplastic anemia (SAA). With great immunomodulatory functions, mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs) are important for bone marrow niche. While the underlying etiology 
of immunologic changes in SAA bone marrow remains unknown, dysfunctional MSCs 
are implicated as a major cause. To provide evidence for their defects in 
immunomodulation, alterations of SAA MSCs in regulating T cell differentiation 
were determined. During differentiation from CD4+ T cells into T helper 17 
(Th17) cells under polarization conditions, impaired inhibition on IL-17 and 
IL-1β production was noted when cocultured with SAA MSCs compared to control 
MSCs (P < 0.05). After stimulation of Th17 activation, the percentage of 
IL-17-secreting cells was significantly increased in the SAA group (9.1 ± 1.5% 
vs 6.6 ± 0.4%, P < 0.01). Under regulatory T (Treg) polarization, a higher 
percentage of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells was detected when cocultured with SAA 
MSCs compared to control MSCs (8.1 ± 0.5% vs 5.8 ± 0.8%, P < 0.01). 
Inconsistently, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) concentrations in the 
culture supernatant were decreased and IL-1β concentrations were elevated in the 
SAA group. Our data indicated impaired inhibition of SAA MSCs on Th17 activation 
and aberrant regulation of SAA MSCs on Treg differentiation. Increased IL-17 and 
IL-1β levels with decreased TGF-β levels in the supernatant suggested the 
potential of SAA MSCs for triggering a hyperinflammatory environment. 
Dysfunctional MSCs could contribute to the lack of immunoprotection in the bone 
marrow, which may be associated with SAA.","DOI: 10.18632/aging.204500

factors. However, its specific mechanism is still not clear. Gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technology is expected to explain the 
possible mechanism of the disease by detecting differential metabolites. 15 
COVID-19 patients and healthy controls were included in this study. Immune 
indicators such as hs CRP and cytokines were detected to reflect the level of 
inflammation in patients with COVID-19. The distribution of lymphocytes and 
subpopulations in peripheral whole blood were detected using flow cytometry to 
assess the immune function of COVID-19 patients. The expression of differential 
metabolites in serum was analyzed using GC-MS non-targeted metabolomics. The 
results showed that hs CRP, IL-5/6/8/10 and IFN-α in the serum of COVID-19 
patients increased to varying degrees, and CD3/4/8+ T lymphocytes decreased. 
Additionally, 53 metabolites in the serum of COVID-19 patients were up 
regulated, 18 metabolites were down regulated, and 8 metabolites remained 
unchanged. Increased Cholesterol, Lactic Acid and 1-Monopalmitin may be the 
mechanism that causes excessive inflammation in COVID-19 patients. The increase 
of D-Allose may be involved in the process of lymphocyte decrease. In 
conclusion, the significance of our study is to reveal the possible mechanism of 
inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19 from the perspective of 
metabolomics. This provided a new idea for the treatment of COVID-19.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part

prediction tools have become essential resources. TCR (T cell receptor) 
repertoires contain important features that differentiate healthy controls from 
cancer patients or differentiate outcomes for patients being treated with 
different drugs. Considering, tools that can easily and quickly generate and 
identify important features out of TCR repertoire data and build accurate 
classifiers to predict future outcomes are essential.
RESULTS: This paper introduces GENTLE (GENerator of T cell receptor repertoire 
features for machine LEarning): an open-source, user-friendly web-application 
tool that allows TCR repertoire researchers to discover important features; to 
create classifier models and evaluate them with metrics; and to quickly generate 
visualizations for data interpretations. We performed a case study with 
repertoires of TRegs (regulatory T cells) and TConvs (conventional T cells) from 
healthy controls versus patients with breast cancer. We showed that diversity 
features were able to distinguish between the groups. Moreover, the classifiers 
built with these features could correctly classify samples ('Healthy' or 'Breast 
Cancer')from the TRegs repertoire when trained with the TConvs repertoire, and 
from the TConvs repertoire when trained with the TRegs repertoire.
CONCLUSION: The paper walks through installing and using GENTLE and presents a 
case study and results to demonstrate the application's utility. GENTLE is 
geared towards any researcher working with TCR repertoire data and aims to 
discover predictive features from these data and build accurate classifiers.

was used to evaluate the effect of transient, focal opening of the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) on the composition of tumor-associated macrophages and microglia 
(TAMs). BBB opening was induced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided 
focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) combined with microbubbles. CX3CR1-GFP cells and 
CCR2-RFP cells in brain tumors were quantified in microscopic images. Tumors in 
animals treated with a single session of MRgFUS did not exhibit significant 
changes in cell numbers when compared with tumors in animals not receiving FUS. 
However, tumors that received two or three sessions of MRgFUS had significantly 
increased amounts of both CX3CR1-GFP and CCR2-RFP cells. The effect of MRgFUS on 
immune cell composition was also characterized and quantified using flow 
cytometry. Glioma implantation resulted in increased amounts of lymphocytes, 
monocytes and neutrophils in the brain parenchyma. Tumors administered MRgFUS 
exhibited increased numbers of monocytes and monocyte-derived TAMs. In addition, 
MRgFUS-treated tumors exhibited more CD80+ cells in monocytes and microglia. In 
summary, transient, focal opening of the BBB using MRgFUS combined with 
microbubbles can activate the homing and differentiation of monocytes and induce 
a shift toward a more pro-inflammatory status of the immune environment in 
glioblastoma.","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

production. How blood cell production switches from homeostasis to emergency 
myelopoiesis is incompletely understood. Here, we show that lymphotoxin-β 
receptor (LTβR) signaling in combination with TNF and IL-1 receptor signaling in 
bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) down-regulates Il7 expression to shut 
down lymphopoiesis during systemic inflammation. LTβR signaling in MSCs also 
promoted CCL2 production during systemic inflammation. Pharmacological or 
genetic blocking of LTβR signaling in MSCs partially enabled lymphopoiesis and 
reduced monocyte numbers in the spleen during systemic inflammation, which 
correlated with reduced survival during systemic bacterial and viral infections. 
Interestingly, lymphotoxin-α1β2 delivered by B-lineage cells, and specifically 
by mature B cells, contributed to promote Il7 down-regulation and reduce MSC 
lymphopoietic activity. Our studies revealed an unexpected role of LTβR

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: Exhausted hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD8 T cells in chronic HBV 
infection are broadly heterogeneous. Characterisation of their functional 
impairment may allow to distinguish patients with different capacity to control 
infection and reconstitute antiviral function.
DESIGN: HBV dextramer+CD8 T cells were analysed ex vivo for coexpression of 
checkpoint/differentiation markers, transcription factors and cytokines in 35 
patients with HLA-A2+chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and in 29 control HBsAg negative 
CHB patients who seroconverted after NUC treatment or spontaneously. Cytokine 
production was also evaluated in HBV peptide-stimulated T cell cultures, in the 
presence or absence of antioxidant, polyphenolic, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and TLR-8 
agonist compounds and the effect on HBV-specific responses was further validated 
on additional 24 HLA-A2 negative CHB patients.
RESULTS: Severely exhausted HBV-specific CD8 T cell subsets with high expression 
of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, TOX and CD39, were detected only in a 
subgroup of chronic viraemic patients. Conversely, a large predominance of 
functionally more efficient HBV-specific CD8 T cell subsets with lower 
expression of coinhibitory molecules and better response to in vitro immune 
modulation, typically detected after resolution of infection, was also observed 
in a proportion of chronic viraemic HBV patients. Importantly, the same subset 
of patients who responded more efficiently to in vitro immune modulation 
identified by HBV-specific CD8 T cell analysis were also identified by staining 
total CD8 T cells with PD-1, TOX, CD127 and Bcl-2.
CONCLUSIONS: The possibility to distinguish patient cohorts with different 
capacity to respond to immune modulatory compounds in vitro by a simple analysis 
of the phenotypic CD8 T cell exhaustion profile deserves evaluation of its 
clinical applicability.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published

arthritis (RA) disease pathogenesis. Blockade of DC activation has been shown to 
curtail Th17 cell differentiation and its aberrant function in RA. Recent 
studies have pointed to the role of the PI3K/AKT signaling axis in the 
maturation and activation of DCs. However, it is yet to be established how 
PI3K/AKT inhibition would lead to the abolishment of DC activation and Th17 cell 
plasticity in RA. Herein, our study decoded whether and how majoon chobchini, an 
unani compound, abated dendritic cell maturation and regulated the Th17/Treg 
paradigm in RA. Given our results, majoon chobchini conspicuously restrained MHC 
II, CD86 expression and, subsequently elevated PDL-1 levels in DCs in-vivo. Of 
note, inhibition of DC maturation by majoon chobchini, in turn, favoured 
suppression of the Th17 cell population while driving Treg cell development in 
adjuvant induced arthritic (AA) rats. Concurrently, majoon chobchini decreased 
the catabolic effects of IL-17 (Th17 associated cytokine) via a reciprocal 
increase in IL-10 (Treg associated cytokine) levels in AA rats. Mechanistically, 
majoon chobchini sustained FoxO1 nuclear localization signaled through dampened 
PI3K/AKT phosphorylation in-vitro. In concert, PDL-1 expression was heightened 
in majoon chobchini treated activated DCs that provides a framework for ablation 
of the DC-Th17 cell pathogenic axis in RA. Notwithstanding, the PI3K inhibitor 
LY294002 exhibited similar inhibitory effects. In essence, majoon chobchini 
enhanced PDL-1 expression that abolished DC maturation via regulation of the 
PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 axis, thereby hindering Th17 differentiation in an animal model 
of RA. This further warrants a clinical investigation that could validate majoon 
chobchini as a prospective therapeutic drug in the treatment of RA.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.cyto.2023.156136

disease relevant context without systemic immune suppression. These therapies 
are especially valuable in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), 
where autoreactive T cells destroy myelin sheath. This work shows that an 
antigen-specific dual-sized microparticle (dMP) system can effectively halt and 
reverse disease progression in a mouse model of MS. Current MS treatments leave 
patients immunocompromised, but the dMP formulation spares the immune system as 
mice can successfully clear a Listeria Monocytogenes infection. Furthermore, we 
highlight design principles for particle based immunotherapies including the 
importance of delivering factors specific for immune cell recruitment (GM-CSF or 
SDF-1), differentiation (GM-CSF or FLT3L) and suppression (TGF-β or VD3) in 
conjunction with disease relevant antigen, as the entire formulation is required 
for maximum efficacy. Lastly, the dMP scheme relies on formulating 
phagocytosable and non-phagocytosable MP sizes to direct payload to target 
either cell surface receptors or intracellular targets, as the reverse sized dMP 
formulation failed to reverse paralysis. We also challenge the design principles 
of the dMP system showing that the size of the MPs impact efficacy and that 
GM-CSF plays two distinct roles and that both of these must be replaced to match 
the primary effect of the dMP system. Overall, this work shows the versatile 
nature of the dMP system and expands the knowledge in particle science by 
emphasizing design tenets to guide the next generation of particle based

cells that provide acute host defense and memory cells that provide sustained 
protection. An alternative outcome is exhaustion, a state of T cell dysfunction 
that occurs in the context of chronic infections and cancer. Although it is 
evident that exhausted CD8+ T (TEX) cells are phenotypically and molecularly 
distinct from effector and memory CD8+ T cells, the factors regulating the 
earliest events in the differentiation process of TEX cells remain incompletely 
understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell 
ATAC-sequencing of CD8+ T cells responding to LCMV-Armstrong (LCMV-Arm) or 
LCMV-Clone 13 (LCMV-Cl13), which result in acute or chronic infections, 
respectively. Compared to CD8+ T cells that had undergone their first division 
in response to LCMV-Arm (Div1ARM) cells, CD8+ T cells that had undergone their 
first division in response to LCMV-Cl13 (Div1CL13) expressed higher levels of 
genes encoding transcription factors previously associated with exhaustion, 
along with higher levels of Ezh2, the catalytic component of the Polycomb 
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) complex, which mediates epigenetic silencing. 
Modulation of Ezh2 resulted in altered expression of exhaustion-associated 
molecules by CD8+ T cells responding to LCMV-Cl13, though the specific cellular 
and infectious contexts, rather than simply the level of Ezh2 expression, likely 
determine the eventual outcome. Taken together, these findings suggest that the 
differentiation paths of CD8+ T cells responding to acute versus chronic 
infections may diverge earlier than previously appreciated.","Copyright: © 2023 Quezada et al. This is an open access article distributed

2(ITGB2) is a member of the leukocyte integrin family (leukocyte integrin), 
participating in lymphocyte recycling and homing, cell adhesion, and cell 
surface-mediated signal transduction. However, few studies on ITGB2 in gliomas 
have been reported yet.This study first discussed the relationship between ITGB2 
expression and clinical characterization of glioma and the prognostic 
significance of its methylation in low-grade glioma.
METHODS: We collected Clinical data and transcription of glioma patients from 
TCGA, CGGA, and Rembrant datasets to analyze the differential expression of 
ITGB2 mRNA in glioma tissues and normal tissues. The box polts to evaluated the 
expression patterns of ITGB2 in different molecular subtypes. Receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) were used to evaluate and verify the reliability of 
the model. Kaplan-Meier survival curves to evaluated the relationship between 
the level of ITGB2 mRNA expression and overall survival (OS). Using cox 
regression analysis to verify the ability of ITGB2 as an independent predictor 
of OS in glioma patients. We use TIMER to analyze and visualize the association 
between immune infiltration levels and a range of variables. The methylation of 
GBMLGG patients were obtained from the TCGA database through the biological 
portal.
RESULTS: ITGB2 can be a potential marker for mesenchymal molecular subtype 
gliomas. COX regression analysis shows that ITGB2 is an independent predictive 
marker of OS in malignant glioma patients. Biological processes show that ITGB2 
has involved glioma immune-related activities, especially closely related to B 
cells, CD4+Tcells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. ITGB2 is 
negatively regulated by ITGB2 methylation, resulting in low expression in LGG 
tissues. Low expression of ITGB2 and high methylation indicate good OS in 
patients with LGG. The ITGB2 methylation risk score (ITMRS) obtained from the 
ITGB2 methylation CpG site can better predict the OS of LGG patients. We used 
univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis of methylationsites, used 
the R language predict function to obtain the risk score of these ITGB2 
methylation sites(ITMRS).
DISCUSSION: ITGB2 can be used as a potential marker of mesenchymal molecular 
subtypes of gliomas and as an independent predictive marker of OS in patients 
with malignant gliomas. The ITMRS we established can be used as an independent 
prognostic factor for LGG and provide a new idea for the diagnosis and treatment 
of LGG.","Copyright © 2023 Liu, Wang, Luo, Zhen, Liu, Zheng, Zhang and Hu.","DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2022.1106120

application in the clinics. In the present study, we first optimized a 
combination of IL-2, TGF-β and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor AS2863619 
(IL-2/TGF-β/AS), which could induce Tregs with high efficiency in vitro. After 
the induced Tregs (iTregs) were confirmed to suppress lymphocyte proliferation

chitosan-stabilized nanoparticle drug delivery system (NDDS) was developed 
according to the optimized formula of IL-2/TGF-β/AS. In vivo study, the NDDS was 
injected into the knees of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). As a 
result, the NDDS remarkably reduced the pathological score of the CIA, 
alleviated the inflammatory cell infiltration and synovial hyperplasia, and 
minimized cartilage tissue damage in the knee joint of the CIA mice. 
Mechanically, the NDDS administration promoted Treg differentiation and 
decreased Th17 production, consequently reversing the ratio of Treg/Th17, and 
reducing the secretion of TNF-α in the sera, which facilitated to relieve the 
severity and progression of arthritis. In sum, NDDS capable of efficiently

tissue homeostasis, controls inflammation, aids in establishing long-term 
protective responses against pathogens, and provides immediate protection from 
infection. CD5+ B-1 cell NAbs recognize evolutionarily fixed epitopes, such as 
phosphatidylcholine (PtC), found on bacteria and senescent red blood cells. 
Anti-PtC antibodies are essential in protection against bacterial sepsis. CD5+ 
B-1 cell-derived NAbs have a unique germline-like structure that lacks 
N-additions, a feature critical for providing protection against infection. 
Previously, we demonstrated the repertoire and germline status of PtC+CD5+ B-1 
cell IgM obtained from male mice changes with age depending on the anatomical 
location of the B-1 cells. More recently, we demonstrated serum antibody from 
aged female mice maintains protection against pneumococcal infection, whereas 
serum antibody from male mice does not provide protection.
RESULTS: Here, we show that aged female mice have significantly more splenic 
PtC+CD5+ B-1 cells and more PtC specific serum IgM than aged male mice. 
Furthermore, we find both age and biological sex related repertoire differences 
when comparing B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing results of PtC+CD5+ B-1 cells. 
While BCR germline status of PtC+CD5+ B-1 cells from aged male and female mice 
is similar in the peritoneal cavity, it differs significantly in the spleen, 
where aged females retain germline configuration and aged males do not. Nucleic 
acid sensing toll-like receptors are critical in the maintenance of PtC+ B-1 
cells; therefore, to begin to understand the mechanism of differences observed 
between the male and female PtC+CD5+ B-1 cell repertoire, we analyzed levels of 
cell-free nucleic acids and found increases in aged females.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the antigenic milieu differs between aged males 
and females, leading to differential selection of antigen-specific B-1 cells 
over time. Further elucidation of how biological sex differences influence the 
maintenance of B-1 cells within the aging environment will be essential to 
understand sex and age-related disparities in the susceptibility to bacterial 
infection and will aid in the development of more effective vaccination and/or 
therapeutic strategies specific for males and females.","Copyright © 2023 Webster, Tsuji, Clemente and Holodick.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.1047297

including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are generally 
believed to be related to immune dysfunction and intestinal microbiota disorder. 
However, the exact mechanism is not yet fully understood. The pathological 
changes associated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis are similar 
to those in human UC. As a subgroup of the innate immune system, group 3 innate 
lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are widely distributed in the lamina propria of the 
intestinal mucosa, and their function can be regulated by a variety of 
molecules. Musashi2 (MSI2) is a type of evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding 
protein that maintains the function of various tissue stem cells and is 
essential for postintestinal epithelial regeneration. The effect of MSI2 
deficiency in ILC3s on IBD has not been reported. Thus, mice with conditional 
MSI2 knockout in ILC3s were used to construct a DSS-induced colitis model and 
explore its effects on the pathogenesis of IBD and the species, quantity and 
function of the intestinal microbiota.
METHODS: Msi2flox/flox mice (Msi2fl/fl ) and Msi2flox/floxRorcCre mice 
(Msi2ΔRorc ) were induced by DSS to establish the IBD model. The severity of 
colitis was evaluated by five measurements: body weight percentage, disease 
activity index, colon shortening degree, histopathological score and routine 
blood examination. The species, quantity and function of the intestinal 
microbiota were characterized by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA 
extracted from fecal samples.
RESULTS: MSI2 was knocked out in the ILC3s of Msi2ΔRorc mice. The Msi2ΔRorc mice 
exhibited reductions in body weight loss, the disease activity index, degree of 
colon shortening, tissue histopathological score and immune cells in the 
peripheral blood compared to those of Msi2fl/fl mice after DSS administration. 
The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that the diversity of the intestinal 
microbiota in DSS-treated Msi2ΔRorc mice changed, with the abundance of 
Firmicutes increasing and that of Bacteroidetes decreasing. The linear 
discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) approach revealed that 
Lactobacillaceae could be the key bacteria in the Msi2ΔRorc mouse during the 
improvement of colitis. Using PICRUST2 to predict the function of the intestinal 
microbiota, it was found that the functions of differential bacteria inferred by 
modeling were mainly enriched in infectious diseases, immune system and 
metabolic functions.
CONCLUSIONS: MSI2 deficiency in ILC3s attenuated DSS-induced colonic 
inflammation in mice and affected intestinal microbiota diversity, composition, 
and function, with Lactobacillaceae belonging to the phylum Firmicutes possibly 
representing the key bacteria. This finding could contribute to our 
understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and provide new insights for its 
clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Copyright © 2023 Li, Xu, Zhang, Zhu, Meng, An, Fu, Zhong, Yang, Lin, Liu, Xia,

    Front Immunol. 2023 Mar 06;14:1170106.","INTRODUCTION: Human pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1) is a so-called commensal virus for 
which no known associated organ disease has been found to date. Yet, it affects 
immune-reconstitution as previously studied in the HIV population, in whom 
active co-infection with HPgV-1 can modulate T and NK cell activation and 
differentiation leading to a protective effect against the evolution of the 
disease. Little is known on the effect of HPgV-1 on immune-reconstitution in 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients, a patient 
population in which we and others have previously reported high prevalence of 
HPgV-1 replication. The aim of this study was to compare the immune 
reconstitution after allo-HSCT among HPgV-1-viremic and HPgV-1-non-viremic 
patients.
METHODS: Within a cohort study of 40 allo-HSCT patients, 20 allo-HSCT recipients 
positive in plasma sample for HPgV-1 by rRT-PCR during the first year (1, 3, 6, 
12 months) after transplantation were matched with 20 allo-HSCT recipients 
negative for HPgV-1. T and NK cell reconstitution was monitored by flow 
cytometry in peripheral blood samples from allo-HSCT recipients at the same time 
points.
RESULTS: We observed no significant difference in the absolute number and 
subsets proportions of CD4 and CD8 T cells between patient groups at any 
analysed timepoint. We observed a significantly higher absolute number of NK 
cells at 3 months among HPgV-1-viremic patients. Immunophenotypic analysis 
showed a significantly higher proportion of CD56bright NK cells mirrored by a 
reduced percentage of CD56dim NK cells in HPgV-1-positive patients during the 
first 6 months after allo-HSCT. At 6 months post-allo-HSCT, NK cell phenotype 
significantly differed depending on HPgV-1, HPgV-1-viremic patients displaying 
NK cells with lower CD16 and CD57 expression compared with HPgV-1-negative 
patients. In accordance with their less differentiated phenotype, we detected a 
significantly reduced expression of granzyme B in NK cells in HPgV-1-viremic 
patients at 6 months.
DISCUSSION: Our study shows that HPgV-1-viremic allo-HSCT recipients displayed 
an impaired NK cell, but not T cell, immune-reconstitution compared with 
HPgV-1-non-viremic patients, revealing for the first time a potential 
association between replication of the non-pathogenic HPgV-1 virus and 
immunomodulation after allo-HSCT.","Copyright © 2023 Pradier, Cordey, Zanella, Melotti, Wang, Mamez, Chalandon,

in B-cell development and activation is largely unknown. Here, we describe the 
first B-cell specific knockout (KO) mouse model of the β regulatory subunit of 
CK2. CK2βKO mice present an increase in marginal zone (MZ) and a reduction in 
follicular B cells, suggesting a role for CK2 in the regulation of the B cell 
receptor (BCR) and NOTCH2 signaling pathways. Biochemical analyses demonstrate 
an increased activation of the NOTCH2 pathway in CK2βKO animals, which sustains 
MZ B-cell development. Transcriptomic analyses indicate alterations in 
biological processes involved in immune response and B-cell activation. Upon 
sheep red blood cells (SRBC) immunization CK2βKO mice exhibit enlarged germinal 
centers (GCs) but display a limited capacity to generate class-switched GC B 
cells and immunoglobulins. In vitro assays highlight that B cells lacking CK2β 
have an impaired signaling downstream of BCR, Toll-like receptor, CD40, and 
IL-4R all crucial for B-cell activation and antigen presenting efficiency. 
Somatic hypermutations analysis upon 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl hapten 
conjugated to Chicken Gamma Globulin (NP-CGG) evidences a reduced NP-specific 
W33L mutation frequency in CK2βKO mice suggesting the importance of the β 
subunit in sustaining antibody affinity maturation. Lastly, since diffuse large 
B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells derive from GC or post-GC B cells and rely on CK2 
for their survival, we sought to investigate the consequences of CK2 inhibition 
on B cell signaling in DLBCL cells. In line with the observations in our murine 
model, CK2 inactivation leads to signaling defects in pathways that are 
essential for malignant B-lymphocyte activation.","Copyright © 2023 Quotti Tubi, Mandato, Canovas Nunes, Arjomand, Zaffino, Manni,

often concurrent in patients. Changes in DNA methylation affect T cell 
biological processes, which may explain the occurrence and progression of 
comorbidity. However, downstream regulatory pathways of DNA methylation in two 
diseases and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: The GSE50101, GSE72541, GSE50222 and OEP002482 were mined for the 
identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or co-expressed genes 
and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in AR and CSU patients. We applied GO 
analysis and consensus clustering to study the potential functions and signal 
pathways of selected genes in two diseases. GSVA and logistic regression 
analysis were used to find the regulatory pathway between DNA methylation and 
activation patterns of CD4+ T cells. Besides, we used the Illumina 850k chip to 
detect DNA methylation expression profiles and recognize the differentially 
methylated CpG positions (DMPs) on corresponding genes. Finally, we annotated 
the biological process of these genes using GO and KEGG pathway analysis.
RESULT: The AR-related DEGs were found closely related to the differentiation 
and activation of CD4+ T cells. The DEGs or co-expressed genes of CD4+ T cells 
in AR and CSU patients were also clustered using GO and KEGG analysis and we got 
57 co-regulatory pathways. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that 
the regulation of cellular component size was closely related to the activation 
of CD4+ T cells regulated by DNA methylation. We got self-tested data using the 
Illumina 850k chip and identified 98 CpGs that were differentially methylated in 
patients. Finally, we mapped the DMPs to 15 genes and found that they were 
mainly enriched in the same CD4+T cell regulating pathway.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that DNA methylation affected by pollen 
participated in the activation patterns of CD4 + T cells, providing a novel 
direction for the symptomatic treatment of the co-occurrence of AR and CSU.","Copyright © 2023 Yang, Wen, Chen, Kang, Xiang, Ding, Gao, Tong and Guo.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.1053558

lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), suggesting 
that DNA methylation might contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL. Aim: We aimed 
to explore the differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with CLL 
and screen the differentially methylated and expressed genes (DMEGs) by 
combining public databases. We aimed to observe the direction of each DMEG in 
CLL based on the DMPs in the promoter and the body region respectively to narrow 
down DMEGs. We also aimed to explore the methylation heterogeneity of CLL 
subgroups and the effect of B cells maturation on CLL. Methods: In this 
population-based case control study, we reported a genome-wide DNA methylation 
association study using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, profiling the 
DNA methylation of CD19+ B Cells from 48 CLL cases and 28 healthy controls. By 
integrating methylation data and expression data from public databases, gene 
sets were jointly screened, and then the relationship between methylation sites 
in promoter and body region and expression of each gene was explored. In 
addition, support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm was used to 
identify subgroups of CLL cases based on methylation pattern, and the effect of 
B-cell differentiation related methylation sites on CLL-related sites was 
observed. Results: We identified 34,797 DMPs related to CLL across the genome, 
most of which were hypomethylated; the majority were located in gene body 
regions. By combining these DMPs with published DNA methylation and RNA 
sequencing data, we detected 26,244 replicated DMPs associated with 1,130 genes 
whose expression were significantly different in CLL cases. Among these DMEGs, 
nine low expressed DMEGs were selected with hypermethylated in promoter and 
hypomethylated in body region, and 83 high expressed DMEGs were selected with 
both hypomethylated in promoter and body region. The 48 CLL cases were divided 
into 3 subgroups based on methylation site by SVM algorithm. Over 92% of CpGs 
associated with B cell subtypes were found in CLL-related DMPs. Conclusion: The 
DNA methylation pattern was altered across the genome in CLL patients. The 
methylation of ZAP70, FMOD, and ADAMTS17 was significantly different between CLL 
cases and controls. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and 
identify the underlying mechanisms through which these methylation markers are 
associated with CLL.","Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Gao, Lin, Goldin, Wang, Stevenson, Edelman, Killian,

ratio (MLR) are used as prognostic biomarkers for many diseases. In this study, 
we aimed to explore the possibility of using ratios of NLR and MLR to predict 
the prognosis of viral encephalitis (VE).
METHODS: A total of 81 patients with an initial diagnosis of VE who were 
admitted to our hospital from January 2018 to January 2021 were retrospectively 
analyzed. A routine blood test within 24 h of admission was utilized to 
determine the ratios of NLR and MLR for each patient. The modified Rankin Scale 
(mRS) at 12 months after discharge was used to evaluate patients' clinical 
prognosis and the patients were divided into the group of good prognosis (mRS ≤ 
1) and the group of poor prognosis (mRS ≥ 2) according to the mRS scores. 
Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were used to differentiate and 
assess independent prognostic factors for the prognosis of VE.
RESULTS: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and MLR of the poor prognosis group were 
significantly higher than that of the good prognosis group. Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis results showed that NLR [odds ratio (OR): 1.421, 
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.105-1.827; P < 0.05] and MLR (OR: 50.423, 95% 
CI: 2.708-939.001; P < 0.05) were independent risk factors for the poor 
prognosis of VE. NLR > 4.32 and MLR > 0.44 were suggested as the cutoff 
threshold for the prediction of the poor prognosis of VE.
CONCLUSION: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and MLR obtained from blood tests 
done at hospital admission have the potential to predict poor prognosis in 
patients with VE.","Copyright © 2023 He, Wang, Chen, Long, Xiao and Hu.","DOI: 10.3389/fneur.2022.1051865

disease. We have demonstrated that mouse type I innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) 
can contribute to controlling the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
However, the functional roles of human ILC1s in AML remain largely undefined. 
Here, we found that the ILC1s in patients with AML are impaired while a high 
expression of the ILC1 gene signature is associated with better overall survival 
in AML. By directly interacting with leukemia stem cells (LSCs), human ILC1s can 
eliminate LSCs via production of IFNγ and block LSC differentiation into M2 
macrophage-like, leukemia-supporting cells through TNF. Collectively, these 
effects converge to limit leukemogenesis in vivo . We also identified Lin - 
CD127 + CD161 - CRTH2 - CD117 - cells as the human ILC1 subset. The use of 
umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells to generate CD161 - 
ILC1s could allow for a readily available supply of ILC1s to be produced for 
human adoptive transfer studies. Together, our findings provide evidence that 
targeting human ILC1s may be a promising therapeutic approach for prolongation 
of disease-free survival in AML.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2319959/v1

proliferation, a function that is frequently dysregulated in cancer. To avoid 
this dysregulation Myc is tightly controlled by numerous layers of regulation. 
One such layer is the use of distal regulatory enhancers to drive Myc 
expression. Here, using chromosome conformation capture to examine B cells of 
the immune system in the first hours after their activation, we reveal a 
previously unidentified enhancer of Myc. The interactivity of this enhancer 
coincides with a dramatic, but discrete, spike in Myc expression 3 h 
post-activation. However, genetic deletion of this region, has little impact on 
Myc expression, Myc protein level or in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation. 
Examination of the enhancer deleted regulatory landscape suggests that enhancer 
redundancy likely sustains Myc expression. This work highlights not only the 
importance of temporally examining enhancers, but also the complexity and 
dynamics of the regulation of critical genes such as Myc.","© 2023 The Authors. Immunology & Cell Biology published by John Wiley & Sons

microenvironment and systemically accumulate in tumor-bearing hosts and patients 
with cancer, facilitating cancer progression. Maitake macromolecular α-glucan 
YM-2A, isolated from Grifola frondosa, inhibits tumor growth by enhancing immune 
responses. The present study investigated the effects of YM-2A on the 
immunosuppressive potential of MDSCs.
MAIN METHODS: YM-2A was orally administered to CT26 tumor-bearing mice, and the 
number of immune cells in the spleen and tumor was measured. Splenic MDSCs 
isolated from the CT26 tumor-bearing mice were treated with YM-2A and 
co-cultured with T cells to measure their inhibitory effect on T cell 
proliferation. For adoptive transfer of monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), YM-2A-treated 
M-MDSCs mixed with CT26 cells were implanted subcutaneously in the mice to 
measure the tumor growth rate.
KEY FINDINGS: YM-2A selectively reduced the accumulation of M-MDSCs but not that 
of polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) in CT26 tumor-bearing mice. In tumor 
tissues, YM-2A treatment induced the polarity of immunostimulatory M1-phenotype; 
furthermore, it increased the infiltration of dendritic, natural killer, and 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. YM-2A treatment of purified M-MDSCs from CT-26 
tumor-bearing mice induced dectin-1-dependent differentiation into M1 
macrophages. YM-2A-treated M-MDSCs lost their inhibitory activity against 
proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of 
M-MDSCs treated with YM-2A inhibited CT26 tumor growth.
SIGNIFICANCE: YM-2A promotes the differentiation of M-MDSCs into 
immunostimulatory M1 macrophages, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer 
immunotherapy.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121453

cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), lymphocyte-activation gene 
3 (LAG-3), and T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) have distinct and 
overlapping inhibitory functions that regulate Tcell activation, 
differentiation, and function. These inhibitory receptors also mediate 
tolerance, and dysregulation of these receptors can result in a breach of 
tolerance and the development of autoimmune syndromes. Similarly, antibody 
blockade of immune checkpoint receptors or their ligands for cancer 
immunotherapy may trigger a spectrum of organ inflammation that resembles 
autoimmunity, termed immune-related adverse events (irAE). In this review, we 
discuss recent advances in the regulation of autoimmunity by immune checkpoint 
receptors. We highlight coordinated gene expression programs linking checkpoint 
receptors, heterogeneity within autoreactive T-cell populations, parallels 
between irAE and autoimmunity, and bidirectional functional interactions between 
immune checkpoint receptors and their ligands.",Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.coi.2023.102283

trafficking to bone marrow (BM) and other organs, to establish immune-mediated 
AA C.B10 mouse model by DsRed mouse (B6 background) lymph nodes (LN) cells 
infusion after a total body irradiation (TBI) . Methods: The C.B10 mice received 
a 5 Gy TBI and then were infused with DsRed mouse (B6 background) LN cells at 
5×10(6)/mouse via a tail vein injection. The severity of bone marrow failure 
(BMF) was observed by mononuclear cell count in bone marrow and peripheral blood 
cell count. On days 3, 6, 9, and 12, mice were sacrificed and collected BM, 
spleens, LN, or thymus to analyze the dynamic change and activation status of 
donor T cells in these organs by a flow cytometry. At day 12, the donor-derived 
T cells from BM, spleens, and LN were sorted to collect the DsRed(+)CD3(+)CD4(+) 
T cells and DsRed(+)CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells for RNA isolation and gene expression 
analyses by PCR array. Results: Relative to control animals that received 5 Gy 
TBI without LN cell infusion, AA mice developed severe BMF with dramatic 
decrease in total BM cells, hemoglobin, white blood cells, and platelets in 
peripheral blood on days 9 and 12 after the LN cell infusion. The frequencies of 
DsRed(+) T cells trafficking to BM, LN, and spleens increased with time. 
Surprisingly, although the DsRed(+) T cells in BM increased dramatically at a 
level much higher than those in the spleens and LN on day 12, there were very 
few DsRed(+) T cells in BM on days three and six, which was significantly lower 
than those in spleens or LN. The frequency of DsRed(+) T cells in thymus was the 
lowest during the whole process. On day 12, the DsRed(+)CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells of 
BM, LN, and spleens from AA mice were (91.38±2.10) %, (39.78±6.98) %, and 
(67.87±12.77) %, respectively. On the contrary, the DsRed(+)CD3(+)CD8(+)T cells 
of BM, LN, and spleens were (98.21±1.49) %, (94.06±4.20) %, and (96.29±1.23) %, 
respectively. We assessed the donor T cell phenotypes using the CD44 and CD62L 
markers and found that almost all of the DsRed(+)CD4(+) or DsRed(+)CD8(+) T 
cells in BM were effector memory T cell phenotype from day 9 to day 12. 
Meanwhile, transcriptome analyses showed higher expression in CD38, IFN-γ, LAG3, 
CSF1, SPP1, and TNFSF13B in BM DsRed(+)CD4(+) and DsRed(+)CD8(+) T cells. 
However, there was a lower expression in FOXP3 and CTLA4 in BM DsRed(+)CD4(+) T 
cells than those in spleens and LN. Conclusions: The DsRed LN cells infusion to 
induce BMF in CB10 mice enabled to track the donor-derived pathogenic T cells. 
Besides previously published findings in this model, we demonstrated that donor 
CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells primarily homed to spleens and LN, expanded and 
differentiated, then infiltrated in BM with a terminal effector memory 
phenotype. The T cells infiltrated in BM showed more activation and less 
immunosuppression characteristics compared to those homing to spleens and LN 
during the BMF development.","Publisher: 目的： 通过DsRed小鼠淋巴细胞输注加全身辐照（TBI）建立免疫介导的再生障碍性贫血（AA）C.B10-H2b/LilMcd 
(C.B10)小鼠模型，分析C.B10 AA小鼠模型中病理性T细胞在不同器官的动态归巢过程及特征。 方法： 
通过异体淋巴细胞输注加TBI建立AA小鼠模型，以TBI组为对照，分析外周血细胞和骨髓单个核细胞数，验证造模效果。在造模的第3、6、9、12天，处死小鼠并收集骨髓、脾脏、淋巴结和胸腺单个核细胞，流式细胞术分析DsRed(+) 
T细胞的动态变化及效应记忆T细胞（T(EM)）、中央记忆T细胞（T(CM)）、初始T细胞（naïve T）和效应T细胞（T(EFF)）的比例。PCR 
Array分析AA小鼠不同组织内DsRed(+)病理性T细胞活化相关基因的表达谱。 结果： 
与TBI组相比，AA组小鼠在造模第9、12天出现严重骨髓衰竭，第12天时骨髓有核细胞数、外周血细胞数均显著减少（P值均<0.05）。AA组小鼠骨髓、脾脏、淋巴结内DsRed(+) 
T细胞比例随时间增加而增加。骨髓中的DsRed(+) 
T细胞比例在第3、6天低于脾脏与淋巴结，但在第12天时高于脾脏与淋巴结（P值均<0.05）。整个骨髓衰竭形成过程中，胸腺中DsRed(+)T细胞比例均最低。在第12天时，AA小鼠骨髓、淋巴结和脾脏单个核细胞中，DsRed(+)CD3(+)CD4(+) 
T细胞比例分别为（91.38±2.10）%、（39.78±6.98）%、（67.87±12.77）%，三者之间两两比较均有统计学意义（P值均<0.05）；DsRed(+)CD3(+)CD8(+) 
T细胞比例分别为（98.21±1.49）%、（94.06±4.20）%、（96.29±1.23）%，差异均无统计学意义（P值均>0.05）。第9、12天，AA组小鼠骨髓中几乎所有的DsRed(+)CD4(+) 
T或DsRed(+)CD8(+) T细胞均为T(EM)，而淋巴结中包括T(EM)、T(CM)以及naïve T。PCR 
Array结果显示：骨髓中DsRed(+)CD4(+)或DsRed(+)CD8(+) 
T细胞中CD38、IFN-γ、LAG3、CSF1、SPP1及TNFSF13B表达增高，但DsRed(+)CD4(+) T细胞中FOXP3、CTLA4表达降低。 
结论： DsRed小鼠淋巴细胞输注可导致C.B10小鼠发生骨髓衰竭，并可以在该AA模型小鼠中追踪DsRed(+)病理性T细胞。在C.B10 
AA模型小鼠体内，DsRed(+)CD8(+)和DsRed(+)CD4(+) 
T细胞先归巢到脾脏与淋巴结，在其中扩增分化，最终转运至骨髓并转化为T(EM)。胸腺对异体T细胞的归巢过程更具抵抗性，提示胸腺在免疫介导AA模型的骨髓衰竭过程中可能是一个免疫豁免部位。在C.B10 
AA模型小鼠的骨髓衰竭形成过程中，归巢到骨髓的DsRed(+)病理性T细胞较迁移到脾脏与淋巴结的细胞具有更强的免疫活性，而免疫抑制活性则减弱。.","DOI: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2022.07.010
