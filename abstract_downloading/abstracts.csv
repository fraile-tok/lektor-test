are a common source of morbidity in people living with HIV (PLWH). Although 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) has lessened the severity of neurocognitive 
disorders, cognitive impairment still occurs in PLWH receiving ART. The 
pathogenesis of HAND is likely multifaceted, but common factors include the 
persistence of HIV transcription within the central nervous system, higher 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the 
presence of activated microglia. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8 are innate 
pathogen recognition receptors located in microglia and other immune and 
non-immune cells that can recognise HIV RNA and trigger pro-inflammatory 
responses. IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1 is key to these signalling 
pathways. Here, we show that IRAK1 inhibition inhibits the TLR7 and 
TLR8-dependent pro-inflammatory response to HIV RNA. Using genetic and 
pharmacological inhibition, we demonstrate that inhibition of IRAK1 prevents 
IRAK1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and the subsequent recruitment of 
TRAF6 and the TAK1 complex to IRAK1, resulting in the inhibition of downstream 
signalling and the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 
release.","DOI: 10.1099/jgv.0.001858

innate immune responses to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and 
Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 ligands despite expressing TLR2 similar to normal 
airway epithelial cells, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
METHODS: Normal or COPD mucociliary-differentiated airway epithelial cells were 
treated with TLR2 agonists or infected with NTHi and expression of β-defensin 
(HBD)2 was examined. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and 
microRNA (miR)146a were genetically inhibited in normal and COPD airway 
epithelial cell cultures, respectively, and HBD2 responses to TLR2 ligands were 
determined. IRAK-1 expression in lung sections was determined by 
immunofluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: Compared to normal, COPD airway epithelial cell cultures showed 
impaired expression of HBD2 in response to TLR2 agonists or NTHi infection. 
Apical secretions from TLR2 agonist-treated normal, but not COPD, airway 
epithelial cells efficiently killed NTHi. Knockdown of HBD2 significantly 
reduced NTHi killing by apical secretions of normal airway epithelial cells. 
Compared to normal, COPD cells showed significantly reduced expression of IRAK-1 
and this was associated with increased expression of miR146a. Inhibition of 
miR146a increased the expression of IRAK-1, improved the expression of HBD2 in 
response to TLR2 agonists in COPD cells and enhanced the killing of bacteria by 
apical secretions obtained from TLR2 agonist-treated COPD cells. Bronchial 
epithelium of COPD patients showed reduced expression of IRAK-1.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that reduced levels of IRAK-1 due to 
increased expression of miR146a may contribute to impaired expression of 
TLR2-induced HBD2 in COPD airway epithelial cells.",Copyright ©The authors 2023.,"DOI: 10.1183/23120541.00694-2022

malignancies. Recent therapeutic efforts to subvert aberrant innate immune 
signaling in MDS and AML have focused on the kinase IRAK4. IRAK4 inhibitors have 
achieved promising, though moderate, responses in pre-clinical studies and in 
clinical trials for MDS and AML. The reasons underlying the limited responses to 
IRAK4 inhibitors remain unknown. Here, we reveal that inhibiting IRAK4 in 
leukemic cells elicits functional complementation and compensation by its 
paralog, IRAK1. Using genetic approaches, we demonstrate that co-targeting IRAK1 
and IRAK4 is required to suppress leukemic stem/progenitor cell (LSPC) function 
and induce differentiation in cell lines and patient-derived cells. While IRAK1 
and IRAK4 are presumed to function primarily downstream of the proximal adapter 
MyD88, we found that complimentary and compensatory IRAK1 and IRAK4 dependencies 
in MDS/AML occur via non-canonical MyD88-independent pathways. Genomic and 
proteomic analyses revealed that IRAK1 and IRAK4 preserve the undifferentiated 
state of MDS/AML LSPCs by coordinating a network of pathways, including ones 
that converge on the PRC2 complex and JAK-STAT signaling. To translate these 
findings, we implemented a structure-based design of a potent and selective dual 
IRAK1 and IRAK4 inhibitor KME-2780. MDS/AML cell lines and patient-derived 
samples showed significant suppression of LSPCs in vitro and in xenograft 
studies when treated with KME-2780 as compared to selective IRAK4 inhibitors.

and TLR7/9-MyD88-IRAKs pathway in chronic eczema lesions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lesional tissues and the surrounding healthy tissues were 
collected from 25 individuals with chronic eczema, and immunohistochemistry was 
used to detect and comparatively analyze the expression profile of CD123, CD2AP, 
toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) along with 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and interferon regulatory 
factor 7 (IRF7) in signaling pathways.
RESULTS: The positive rates of CD2AP + pDC and CD123 + pDC in lesional tissues 
were significantly elevated compared to the surrounding healthy tissues (P < 
0.05). They were distributed in both the epidermal and dermal layers of the 
lesional tissue, but the majority were in the dermal layer. The TLR7, TLR9, 
IRAK1 and IRF7 were more expressed in dermal layers of the lesional tissue with 
higher positive rates of expression compared to the surrounding healthy tissues 
(P < 0.05). IRAK1 and IRF7 were expressed in a small amount in the epidermal 
layer with higher positive rates of expression than in the surrounding healthy 
tissues (P < 0.05), while the positive rates of TLR7 and TLR9 expression in the 
epidermal layer were not statistically different from those in the surrounding 
healthy tissues (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: PDC and TLR7/9-MyD88-IRAKs pathways are actively expressed in 
chronic eczema lesions and may be involved in pathogenesis and disease 
progression.",© 2023 Wen et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/CCID.S405491

have not been fully elucidated. This study examined the anti-inflammation 
effects of miR-146b-5p in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human dental pulp 
cells (hDPCs). An increase in human miR-146b-5p (hsa-miR-146b-5p) expression 
following the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in 
LPS-stimulated hDPCs. The expression of hsa-miR-146b-5p and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines was down-regulated by a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inhibitor, and 
the expression of hsa-miR-146b-5p was also decreased by a JAK1/2 inhibitor. 
Enforced expression of hsa-miR-146b-5p abolished phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 
and down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB 
signaling components, such as interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and

(MDS) and emerging evidence suggests that MDS hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cells (HSPCs) exhibit an altered response to inflammation. Deletion of 
chromosome 5 (del(5q)) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in MDS. 
Although this MDS subtype contains several haploinsufficient genes that impact 
innate immune signaling, the effects of inflammation on del(5q) MDS HSPCs 
remains undefined. Utilizing a model of del(5q)-like MDS, inhibiting the 
IRAK1/4-TRAF6 axis improved cytopenias, suggesting that activation of innate 
immune pathways contributes to certain clinical features underlying the 
pathogenesis of low-risk MDS. However, low-grade inflammation in the 
del(5q)-like MDS model did not contribute to more severe disease but instead 
impaired the del(5q)-like HSPCs as indicated by their diminished numbers, 
premature attrition and increased p53 expression. Del(5q)-like HSPCs exposed to 
inflammation became less quiescent, but without affecting cell viability. 
Unexpectedly, the reduced cellular quiescence of del(5q) HSPCs exposed to 
inflammation was restored by p53 deletion. These findings uncovered that 
inflammation confers a competitive advantage of functionally defective del(5q) 
HSPCs upon loss of p53. Since TP53 mutations are enriched in del(5q) AML 
following an MDS diagnosis, increased p53 activation in del(5q) MDS HSPCs due to 
inflammation may create a selective pressure for genetic inactivation of p53 or 
expansion of a pre-existing TP53-mutant clone.","DOI: 10.3324/haematol.2022.282349

and immune-modulating activities. Immune stimulation of cells with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) activates proinflammatory gene expression 
and cytokine secretion, both of which are attenuated by rhesus theta-defensin-1 
(RTD-1) inhibition of NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. Endotoxin tolerance is a 
condition that ensues when cells have an extended primary exposure to low levels 
of LPS, resulting in resistance to a subsequent LPS challenge. Recognition of 
LPS by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) activates NF-κB, elevating levels of 
microRNA-146a (miR-146a), which targets IRAK1 and TRAF6 transcripts to reduce 
their protein levels and inhibits TLR signaling on secondary LPS stimulation. 
Here, we report that RTD-1 suppressed the expression of miR-146a and stabilized 
the IRAK1 protein in immune-stimulated, monocytic THP-1 cells. Cells that had 
primary exposure to LPS became endotoxin-tolerant, as evident from their failure 
to secrete TNF-α upon secondary endotoxin challenge. However, cells incubated 
with RTD-1 during the primary LPS stimulation secreted TNF-α after secondary LPS 
stimulation in an RTD-1 dose-dependent manner. Consistent with this, compared to 
the control treatment, cells treated with RTD-1 during primary LPS stimulation 
had increased NF-κB activity after secondary LPS stimulation. These results show 
that RTD-1 suppresses endotoxin tolerance by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and

the efficacy is limited by radioresistance. The function of Interleukin-1

remains to be elucidated. IRAK1 expression and its correlation with prognosis 
were analyzed in glioma tissues. We found that glioma patients with 
overexpressed IRAK1 show a poor prognosis. Notably, ionizing radiation (IR) 
remarkably induces IRAK1 expression, which was decreased by STING antagonist 
H-151 treatment. JASPAR prediction, ChIP assays, and dual luciferase reporter 
assays indicated that transcription factor FOXA2, suppressed by STING

were all highly conserved among species and showed the highest homology to that 
of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus. Pf_NFκB1 showed the highest homology to that of 
Ictalurus punetaus. All of the five genes showed similar expression patterns in 
various tissues, with the highest expression level in the liver. These genes 
also showed similar expression levels in different embryonic development stages, 
except Pf_IRAK4. The higher expression level was detected from fertilized eggs 
to 1 day post hatching (dph), lower expression from 3 dph to 30 dph. After 
stimulation of inactivated Aeromonas hydrophila, the mRNA expressions of 
Pf_MyD88, Pf_IRAK4, Pf_IRAK1, Pf_TRAF6 and Pf_NFκB1 were significantly increased 
at 24 h in the liver, spleen, head kidney and trunk kidney, suggesting that all 
the five genes were involved in the innate immune response of yellow catfish. 
These results showed that MyD88-dependent signaling pathway plays important 
roles for disease defensing in the innate immune response. Meanwhile, 
inactivated A. hydrophila can cause strong innate immune response, which 
provides theoretical bases for the application of inactivated vaccines in 
defense against bacterial diseases of teleost.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.fsi.2023.108712

cord-derived MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (hucMSC-EVs) in a mouse model of 
desiccation-induced dry eye disease (DED).
METHODS: hucMSC-EVs were enriched by ultracentrifugation. The DED model was 
induced by desiccating environment combined with scopolamine administration. The 
DED mice were divided into the hucMSC-EVs group, fluorometholone (FML) group, 
PBS group, and blank control group. Tear secretion, corneal fluorescein 
staining, the cytokine profiles in tears and goblet cells, TUNEL-positive cell, 
and CD4+ cells were examined to assess therapeutic efficiency. The miRNAs in the 
hucMSC-EVs were sequenced, and the top 10 were used for miRNA enrichment 
analysis and annotation. The targeted DED-related signaling pathway was further 
verified by using RT‒qPCR and western blotting.
RESULTS: Treatment with hucMSC-EVs increased the tear volume and maintained 
corneal integrity in DED mice. The cytokine profile in the tears of the 
hucMSC-EVs group presented with a lower level of proinflammatory cytokines than 
PBS group. Moreover, hucMSC-EVs treatment increased goblet cell density and 
inhibited cell apoptosis and CD4+ cell infiltration. Functional analysis of the 
top 10 miRNAs in hucMSC-EVs showed a high correlation with immunity. Among them, 
miR-125 b, let-7b, and miR-6873 were conserved between humans and mice and were 
associated with the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-κB pathway that was activated in DED. 
Furthermore, IRAK1/TAB2/NF-κB pathway activation and the abnormal expression of 
IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, and TNF-α were reversed by hucMSC-EVs.
CONCLUSIONS: hucMSCs-EVs alleviate DED signs, suppress inflammation and restore 
homeostasis of the corneal surface by multitargeting the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-κB 
pathway via certain miRNAs.",Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jtos.2023.03.002

for bone regeneration, but the specific molecular mechanism remains largely 
unknown. Herein, we addressed this issue in a temperature-responsive PF127 
hydrogel loaded with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived exosomes 
(Exos) (PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos) during alveolar bone regeneration. Genes 
enriched in BMSC-Exos and upregulated during the osteogenic differentiation of 
BMSCs and their downstream regulators were predicted by bioinformatics analyses. 
CTNNB1 was predicted to be the key gene of BMSC-Exos in the osteogenic 
differentiation of BMSCs, during which miR-146a-5p, IRAK1, and TRAF6 might be 
the downstream factors. Osteogenic differentiation was induced in BMSCs, in 
which ectopic expression of CTNNB1 was introduced and from which Exos were 
isolated. The CTNNB1-enriched PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos were constructed and 
implanted into in vivo rat models of alveolar bone defects. In vitro experiment 
data showed that PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos efficiently delivered CTNNB1 to BMSCs, 
which subsequently promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, as 
evidenced by enhanced ALP staining intensity and activity, extracellular matrix 
mineralization (p < 0.05), and upregulated RUNX2 and OCN expression (p < 0.05). 
Functional experiments were conducted to examine the relationships among CTNNB1, 
microRNA (miR)-146a-5p, and IRAK1 and TRAF6. Mechanistically, CTNNB1 activated 
miR-146a-5p transcription to downregulate IRAK1 and TRAF6 (p < 0.05), which 
induced the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and facilitated alveolar bone 
regeneration in rats (increased new bone formation and elevated BV/TV ratio and 
BMD, all with p < 0.05). Collectively, CTNNB1-containing PF127 
hydrogel@BMSC-Exos promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by regulating 
the miR-146a-5p/IRAK1/TRAF6 axis, thus inducing the repair of alveolar bone 
defects in rats.","DOI: 10.3390/nano13061083

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence suggests that immunoproteasome is implicated in 
the various neurological diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis and 
neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether the immunoproteasome itself 
deficiency causes brain disease is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to explore the contribution of the immunoproteasome subunit low 
molecular weight protein 2 (LMP2) in neurobehavioral functions.
METHODS: Male LMP2 gene completed knockout (LMP2-KO) and littermate wild type 
(WT) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged 12-month-old were used for neurobehavioral 
testing and detection of proteins expression by western blotting and 
immunofluorescence. A battery of neurobehavioral test tools including Morris 
water maze (MWM), open field maze, elevated plus maze were used to evaluate the 
neurobehavioral changes in rats. Evans blue (EB) assay, Luxol fast blue (LFB) 
and Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining were applied to explore the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) integrity, brain myelin damage and brain intracellular reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) levels, respectively.
RESULTS: We firstly found that LMP2 gene deletion did not cause significantly 
difference in rats' daily feeding activity, growth and development as well as 
blood routine, but it led to metabolic abnormalities including higher levels of 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid and blood glucose in the LMP2-KO 
rats. Compared with the WT rats, LMP2-KO rats displayed obviously cognitive 
impairment and decreased exploratory activities, increased anxiety-like behavior 
and without strong effects on gross locomotor abilities. Furthermore, multiple 
myelin loss, increased BBB leakage, downregulation of tight junction proteins 
ZO-1, claudin-5 and occluding, and enhanced amyloid-β protein deposition were 
observed in brain regions of LMP2-KO rats. In addition, LMP2 deficiency 
significantly enhanced oxidative stress with elevated levels of ROS, caused the 
reactivation of astrocytes and microglials and markedly upregulated protein 
expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), 
IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) compared to the WT rats, respectively.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight LMP2 gene global deletion causes 
significant neurobehavioral dysfunctions. All these factors including metabolic 
abnormalities, multiple myelin loss, elevated levels of ROS, increased BBB 
leakage and enhanced amyloid-β protein deposition maybe work together and 
eventually led to chronic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation response in the 
brain regions of LMP2-KO rats, which contributed to the initial and progress of 
cognitive impairment.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-023-04071-0

cells is higher than spermatozoa that do not attach. FT epithelial cells can 
distinguish normal and abnormal sperm chromatin. This study investigated the 
effects of sperm with a high-DNA fragmentation index (DFI) from men with 
unexplained repeated implantation failure (RIF) on the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
signaling pathway in human FT cells in vitro.
METHODS: Ten men with a RIF history and high-DFI and 10 healthy donors with 
low-DFI comprised the high-DFI (>30%) and control (<30%) groups, respectively. 
After fresh semen preparation, sperm were co-cultured with a human FT epithelial 
cell line (OE-E6/E7) for 24 hours. RNA was extracted from the cell line and the 
human innate and adaptive immune responses were tested using an RT2 profiler 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array.
RESULTS: The PCR array data showed significantly higher TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-3, 
TLR-6, interleukin 1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, interferon α (IFN-α), IFN-β, 
tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), CXCL8, GM-CSF, G-CSF, CD14, ELK1, IRAK1, IRAK2,

NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, TIRAP, and TRAF6 expression in the high-DFI group than in the 
control group. These factors are all involved in the TLR-MyD88 signaling 
pathway.
CONCLUSION: The MyD88-dependent pathway through TLR-1, TLR-2, and TLR-6 
activation may be one of the main inflammatory pathways activated by high-DFI 
sperm from men with RIF. Following activation of this pathway, epithelial cells 
produce inflammatory cytokines, resulting in neutrophil infiltration, 
activation, phagocytosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and 
apoptosis.","DOI: 10.5653/cerm.2022.05610

diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the 
panel of expressed blood miRNAs in response to aggregated Aβ1-42 peptides 
infused in the hippocampus of adult rats to mimic events of the early onset of 
non-familial AD disorder. Aβ1-42 peptides in the hippocampus led to cognitive 
impairments associated with an astrogliosis and downregulation of circulating 
miRNA-146a-5p, -29a-3p, -29c-3p, -125b-5p, and-191-5p. We established the 
kinetics of expression of selected miRNAs and found differences with those 
detected in the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mouse model. Of note, miRNA-146a-5p was 
exclusively dysregulated in the Aβ-induced AD model. The treatment of primary 
astrocytes with Aβ1-42 peptides led to miRNA-146a-5p upregulation though the 
activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which in turn downregulated IRAK-1 
but not TRAF-6 expression. As a consequence, no induction of IL-1β, IL-6, or 
TNF-α was detected. Astrocytes treated with a miRNA-146-5p inhibitor rescued 
IRAK-1 and changed TRAF-6 steady-state levels that correlated with the induction 
of IL-6, IL-1β, and CXCL1 production, indicating that miRNA-146a-5p operates 
anti-inflammatory functions through a NF-κB pathway negative feedback loop. 
Overall, we report a panel of circulating miRNAs that correlated with Aβ1-42 
peptides' presence in the hippocampus and provide mechanistic insights into 
miRNA-146a-5p biological function in the development of the early stage of 
sporadic AD.","DOI: 10.3390/cells12050694

brain injury (TBI), which has been mainly mediated by the microglia. MiR-124 was 
reported to play an important role in the polarization of microglia by targeting 
TLR4 signaling pathway. However, the role and mechanism of miR-124 in 
neuroinflammation mediated by microglia after TBI is unclear. To clarify this, 
we performed this research.
METHODS: The expression of miR-124 was first measured by RT-PCR in the injured 
brain at 1/3/7 days post-TBI. Then, miR-124 mimics or inhibitors administration 
was used to interfere the expression of miR-124 at 24 h post-TBI. Subsequently, 
the microglia polarization markers were detected by RT-PCR, the expression of 
inflammatory cytokines was detected by ELISA, the expression of 
TLR4/MyD88/IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB was measured by WB, and the neurological deficit 
was evaluated by NSS and MWM test. At last, in vitro experiments were performed 
to explore the exact target molecule of miR-124 on TLR4 signaling pathway.
RESULTS: Animal research indicated that the expression of miR-124 was 
downregulated after TBI. Upregulation of miR-124 promoted the M2 polarization of 
microglia and inhibited the activity of TLR4 pathway, as well as reduced 
neuroinflammation and neurological deficit after TBI. In vitro experiments 
indicated that miR-124 promoted the M2 polarization of microglia and reduced 
neuroinflammation by inhibiting TRAF6.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that upregulation of miR-124 promoted the M2 
polarization of microglia and reduced neuroinflammation after TBI by inhibiting 
TRAF6.","© 2023 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000528502

death in men worldwide, prognostic stratification and treatment modalities are 
still limited for patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Recently, the 
introduction of genomic profiling and the use of new techniques like 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) in many cancers provide novel tools for the 
discovery of new molecular targets that might improve our understanding of the 
genomic aberrations in PCa and the discovery of novel prognostic and therapeutic 
targets. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms through which 
Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) produces its possible protective role in PCa using NGS in both 
the DKK3 overexpression PCa cell line (PC3) model and our patient cohort 
consisting of nine PCa and five benign prostatic hyperplasia. Interestingly, our 
results have shown that DKK3 transfection-modulated genes are involved in the 
regulation of cell motility, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), 
and cytokine signaling in the immune system, as well as in the regulation of 
adaptive immune response. Further analysis of our NGS using our in vitro model 
revealed the presence of 36 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DKK3 
transfected cells and PC3 empty vector. In addition, both CP and ACE2 genes were 
differentially expressed not only between the transfected and empty groups but 
also between the transfected and Mock cells. The top common DEGs between the 
DKK3 overexpression cell line and our patient cohort are the following: IL32, 
IRAK1, RIOK1, HIST1H2BB, SNORA31, AKR1B1, ACE2, and CP. The upregulated genes 
including IL32, HIST1H2BB, and SNORA31 showed tumor suppressor functions in 
various cancers including PCa. On the other hand, both IRAK1 and RIOK1 were 
downregulated and involved in tumor initiation, tumor progression, poor outcome, 
and radiotherapy resistance. Together, our results highlighted the possible role 
of the DKK3-related genes in protecting against PCa initiation and progression.","Copyright © 2023 Shareef, Hachim, Talaat, Bhamidimarri, Ershaid, Ilce,

(IECs) model was used to investigate whether autochthonous B. siamensis LF4 
could modulate the expression of AMPs in IECs. And then, the IECs were treated 
with active, heat-inactivated LF4 and its supernatant to illustrate their AMPs 
inducing effects and the possible signal transduction mechanisms. The results 
showed that after 3 h of incubation with 108 CFU/mL B. siamensis LF4, lactate

study, we report on the histopathological and immunohistochemical features of 
the gills of the crucian carp Carassius auratus challenged with Aeromonas 
hydrophila. Small RNA libraries of the gills were constructed and sequenced on 
the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 1,165 differentially expressed 
miRNAs (DEMs) were identified in gills, of which 539 known and 7 unknown DEMs 
were significantly screened (p < 0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that the 
potential target genes/proteins were primarily involved in 33 immune-related 
pathways, in which the inflammatory responses were focused on the Toll-like 
receptor (TLR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Moreover, the expression levels of 14 key 
miRNAs (e.g., miR-10, miR-17, miR-26a, miR-144, miR-145, and miR-146a) and their 
target genes (e.g., TNFα, TLR4, NF-κB, TAB1, PI3K, and IRAK1) were verified. In 
addition, the protein levels based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute 
quantification (iTRAQ) were significantly associated with the results of the 
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (p < 0.01). miR-17/pre-miR-17 were 
identified in the regulation expression of the NF-κB target gene, and the 
phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the pre-miR-17 of C. auratus with the 
closest similarity to the zebrafish Danio rerio is highly conserved in teleosts.

chronic inflammation. However, considering the increasingly aging global 
population, the effectiveness of existing treatments for sarcopenia is not 
exact, and acupuncture, as an effective anti-inflammatory therapy, has the 
potential to treat it.
METHODS: Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into five groups, 
including Control group, D-galactose (D-gal) group, D-gal + acupuncture (DA) 
group, D-gal + non-acupoint (DN) group and D-gal amino acid mixture (DAA) group. 
An aging rat was model constructed using D-gal for 12 weeks. Rats in the control 
group received 0.9% physiological saline daily. Treatment groups were 
acupunctured or given amino acid mixture interventions daily, and lasted for 
last 4 consecutive weeks. The effects of acupuncture were evaluated by the 
hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E), transmission electron microscopic (TEM) 
examination and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling 
(TUNEL) assays. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of acupuncture was studied by 
using the expressions of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) mediated nuclear factor-kappa 
B (NF-κB) signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by 
immunofluorescence, western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: Rats injected by D-galactose (D-gal) revealed apparent skeletal muscle 
atrophy with significantly reduced cross-sectional area and fiber diameter. In 
contrast, acupuncture treatment alleviated these hallmarks of skeletal muscle 
atrophy and mitigated the mitochondrial aberrations and skeletal muscle 
apoptosis in D-gal rats. In addition, acupuncture also downgraded the 
overexpression of inflammatory factors in skeletal muscle, influenced miR-146a 
and the target genes level, and inhibited NF-κB nuclear translation in D-gal 
rats.
CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may ameliorate skeletal muscle atrophy, and its effects 
may be associated with the control of mitochondrial function regulation and the

performed using genes from these modules. A one-way Cox analysis was performed 
on a dataset of 149 non-M3 AML patients downloaded from the TCGA. This 
identified four genes as significant: FTH1, RCC2, ABHD17B, and IRAK1. Through 
survival analysis, FTH1 was identified as a key gene associated with AML 
prognosis. We verified the proliferative and regulatory effects of ferroptosis 
on MOLM-13 and THP-1 cells using Liproxstatin-1 and Erastin respectively by 
CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. Furthermore, we assayed expression levels of 
FTH1 in MOLM-13 and THP-1 cells after induction and inhibition of ferroptosis by 
real-time quantitative PCR, which showed that upregulated FTH1 expression 
promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in leukemia cells. In conclusion, 
high expression of FTH1 promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of 
leukemic cells through the ferroptosis pathway and is thus a potential risk

inhibition of LPS-induced IRAK4/MyD88, IRAK4/IRAK1, and IRAK1/TRAF6 association

the deadliest of all cancers. Apoptosis is a key pathway in regulating the cell 
growth rate, proliferation, and occurrence of lung cancer. This process is 
controlled by many molecules, such as microRNAs and their target genes. 
Therefore, finding new medical approaches such as exploring diagnostic and 
prognostic biomarkers involved in apoptosis is needed for this disease. In the 
present study, we aimed to identify key microRNAs and their target genes that 
could be used in the prognosis and diagnosis of lung cancer.
METHODS: Signaling pathways, genes, and microRNAs involved in the apoptotic 
pathway were identified by bioinformatics analysis and recent clinical studies. 
Bioinformatics analysis was performed on databases including NCBI, TargetScan, 
UALCAN, UCSC, KEGG, miRPathDB, and Enrichr, and clinical studies were extracted 
from PubMed, web of science, and SCOPUS databases.
RESULTS: NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK pathways play critical roles in the 
regulation of apoptosis. MiR-146b, 146a, 21, 23a, 135a, 30a, 202, and 181 were 
identified as the involved microRNAs in the apoptosis signaling pathway, and 
IRAK1, TRAF6, Bcl-2, PTEN, Akt, PIK3, KRAS, and MAPK1 were classified as the 
target genes of the mentioned microRNAs respectively. The essential roles of 
these signaling pathways and miRNAs/target genes were approved through both 
databases and clinical studies. Moreover, surviving, living, BRUCE, and XIAP was 
the main inhibitor of apoptosis which act by regulating the apoptosis-involved 
genes and miRNAs.
CONCLUSION: Identifying the abnormal expression and regulation of miRNAs and 
signaling pathways in apoptosis of lung cancer can represent a novel class of 
biomarkers that can facilitate the early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and 
prediction of drug response for lung cancer patients. Therefore, studying the 
mechanisms of apoptosis including signaling pathways, miRNAs/target genes, and 
the inhibitors of apoptosis are advantageous for finding the most practical 
approach and reducing the pathological demonstrations of lung cancer.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12931-023-02366-w

therapy resistance. We have established primary BCSC cultures from human tumours 
of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subgroup of breast cancer likely 
driven by BCSCs. Primary BCSCs produce xenografts that phenocopy the tumours of 
origin, making them an ideal model for studying breast cancer treatment options. 
In the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468, we previously screened kinases whose depletion 
elicited a differentiation response, among which IRAK2 was identified. Because 
primary BCSCs are enriched in IRAK2, we wondered whether IRAK2 downregulation 
might affect cellular growth. IRAK2 was downregulated in primary BCSCs and 
MDA-MB-468 by lentiviral delivery of shRNA, causing a decrease in cellular 
proliferation and sphere-forming capacity. When orthotopically transplanted into 
immunocompromised mice, IRAK2 knockdown cells produced smaller xenografts than 
control cells. At the molecular level, IRAK2 downregulation reduced NF-κB and 
ERK phosphorylation, IL-6 and cyclin D1 expression, ERN1 signalling and 
autophagy in a cell line-dependent way. Overall, IRAK2 downregulation decreased 
cellular aggressive growth and pathways often exploited by cancer cells to 
endure stress; therefore, IRAK2 may be considered an interesting target to 
compromise TNBC progression.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms24032520

(NLRP3) inflammasome triggers pyroptosis proinflammatory cell death in 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the underlying 
mechanisms of the inflammatory processes of microglia in EAE remain unclear. Our 
previous studies suggested that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 
(IRAK)-M down-regulates the toll-like receptor 4/interleukin-1 receptor 
signaling pathway. Here, we used IRAK-M knockout (IRAK-M-/-) mice and their 
microglia to dissect the role of IRAK-M in EAE. We found that deletion of IRAK-M 
increased the incidence rate and exacerbated the clinical symptoms in EAE mice. 
We then found that IRAK-M deficiency promoted the activation of microglia, 
activated NLRP3 inflammasomes, and enhanced GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in the 
microglia of EAE. In contrast, over-expression of IRAK-M exerted inhibitory 
effects on neuroinflammation, NLRP3 activation, and pyroptosis. Moreover, IRAK-M 
deficiency enhanced the phosphorylation of IRAK1, while IRAK-M over-expression 
downregulated the level of phosphorylated IRAK1. Finally, we found upregulated 
binding of IRAK1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in IRAK-M-/- EAE 
mice compared to WT mice, which was blocked in AAVIRAK-M EAE mice. Our study 
reveals a complex signaling network of IRAK-M, which negatively regulates

metastatic brain malignancies. This is partly due to restrictions of the 
blood-brain barrier and their unique microenvironment. These challenges are most 
evident in cancers such as lymphoma and melanoma, which are typically responsive 
to treatment in systemic locations but resistant when established in the brain. 
We propose interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) as a potential 
target across these diseases and describe the activity and mechanism of oral 
IRAK-4 inhibitor CA-4948.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and 
melanoma brain metastases (MBM) samples were analyzed for expression of IRAK-4 
and downstream transcription pathways. We next determined the central nervous 
system (CNS) applicability of CA-4948 in naïve and tumor-bearing mice using 
models of PCNSL and MBM. The mechanistic effect on tumors and the tumor 
microenvironment was then analyzed.
RESULTS: Human PCNSL and MBM have high expression of IRAK-4, IRAK-1, and nuclear 
factor kappa B (NF-κB). This increase in inflammation results in reflexive 
inhibitory signaling. Similar profiles are observed in immunocompetent murine 
models. Treatment of tumor-bearing animals with CA-4948 results in the 
downregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in addition 
to decreased NF-κB. These intracellular changes are associated with a survival 
advantage.
CONCLUSIONS: IRAK-4 is an attractive target in PCNSL and MBM. The inhibition of 
IRAK-4 with CA-4948 downregulates the expression of important transcription 
factors involved in tumor growth and proliferation. CA-4948 is currently being 
investigated in clinical trials for relapsed and refractory lymphoma and 
warrants further translation into PCNSL and MBM.",©2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-1682

of Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H.Chen (PN) leaves, which has the effect of 
reducing inflammatory response, facilitating fibroblast proliferation, as well 
as promoting angiogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the molecular basis 
of PNS combined with bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) for treating diabetic 
cutaneous ulcers (DCU) and its mechanism of action.
METHODS: A total of 75 SD rats were selected to make diabetic cutaneous ulcers 
model. According random number table method, the rats were randomly divided into 
a control group, a DCU group, a BMSCs group, a PNS group and BMSCs + PNS group. 
Five groups of rats were given without treatment. After being treated for 
7 days, the rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and granulation tissue 
was collected from the central point of the wound. They were used for 
pathological analysis, Western blot (WB) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
assays.
RESULTS: The wound healing area was the largest in the BMSCs + PNS group. HE 
staining results showed that the PNS + BMSCs group could promote the formation 
of new epidermis and reduce the infiltration of inflammatory cells. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results showed that the PNS + BMSCs group could 
up-regulate the expression of Ki67 protein and cell proliferation. In addition, 
PNS combined with BMSCs up-regulated the expression of miR-146-5p and 
down-regulated the expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, IRAK1, TRAF6 and p65 in 
the NF-κB signaling pathway (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PNS combined with bone mesenchymal stem cell transplantation 
up-regulated miR-146a-5p targeting and binding to IRAK1/TRAF6, inhibiting the 
activation of NF-κB pathway, which reduced the inflammatory response of DCU and 
facilitated the skin healing of DCU. Thus, this study provides a theoretical

haplotype (H1) with susceptibility to childhood-onset systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), and to compare its frequency and genetic structure in the 
Mexican population with those in other continental populations.
METHODS: We genotyped 15 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that form the H1 
haplotype, using TaqMan real-time PCR. The association analysis [case-control 
and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT)] included 376 cases and 400 adult 
controls, all of whom were mestizos (MEZ). To identify risk alleles in Mexican 
Indigenous individuals, SNVs were imputed from whole-exome sequencing data of 
1,074 individuals. The allelic frequencies determined in MEZ and Indigenous 
individuals were compared with those of the continental populations from the 
1,000 Genomes database phase 3. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis of risk 
alleles was performed on all populations. Interleukin-1 receptor associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1) and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) mRNA levels were 
determined using real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Case-control analysis revealed genetic association with childhood-onset 
SLE for all 15 SNVs (OR = 1.49-1.75; p = 0.0095 to 1.81 × 10-4) and for the Xq28 
risk haplotype (OR = 1.97, p = 4 × 10-6). Comparing with individuals of European 
ancestry (0.14-0.16), the frequencies of the risk alleles were significantly 
higher in the MEZ individuals (0.55-0.68) and even higher in Indigenous 
individuals (0.57-0.83). LD analysis indicated a differential haplotype 
structure within the Indigenous groups, which was inherited to the MEZ 
population as a result of genetic admixture. Individuals homozygous for the Xq28 
risk haplotype exhibited decreased levels of both MECP2A and B transcripts.
CONCLUSION: We found that the H1 risk haplotype differs in its conformation in 
the Mexican population. This difference could be attributed to positive 
selection within the Indigenous population, with its inheritance now having an 
autoimmune health impact in both the Mexican Indigenous and MEZ populations.","Copyright © 2023 García-Ortiz, Barajas-Olmos, Flores-Huacuja, Morales-Rivera,

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) affects the outcomes of 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC cells released exosomes to suppress 
the antitumor activity of TAMs. MiR-146a is a critical regulator in TAM 
polarization. We hypothesized that NSCLC cells released exosomal miR-146a to 
regulate TAM polarization and thus affected its antitumor activity.
METHODS: We used H1299 cells-derived exosomes to stimulate THP-1 cells that was 
pretreated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (M0 macrophage). Flow cytometry 
and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used 
to determine the polarization of macrophages. The conditioned medium of 
exosome-treated M0 cells was used to culture H1299 cells, and the Cell Counting 
Kit-8, Ki67, transwell and scratch wound assays were used to determine the 
biological behavior of H1299 cells. To investigate whether exosomal miR-146a 
regulates TAM macrophages through targeting tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK-1), we used small interfering RNA to knockdown the expressions of 
them.
RESULTS: Upregulation of miR-146a inhibited M1 polarization and thus impaired 
the antitumor activity of TAMs. Exosomes released by H1299 cells can be taken by 
M0 macrophage, and they upregulated the expression of miR-146a in M0 macrophage. 
The exosome suppresses M1 polarization by exosomal miR-146a. TRAF-6 and IRAK-1 
mediated the inhibitive effects of exosomal miR-146a on M1 polarization.
CONCLUSIONS: NSCLC cells released exosomal miR-146a to inhibit the expressions 
of TRAF-6 and IRAK-1 in TAMs, resulting in the impaired antitumor activity of 
TAMs. NSCLC cell-derived exosomal miR-146a represents a novel therapeutic target 
for NSCLC treatment.",2022 Annals of Translational Medicine. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/atm-22-5565

organisms to fine dust. Therefore, research efforts are being made to devise 
preventive and therapeutic remedies against fine dust-induced chronic diseases.
METHODS: Research of the respiratory protective effects of KRG extract in a 
particulate matter (PM; aerodynamic diameter of <4 μm) plus diesel exhaust 
particle (DEP) (PM4+D)-induced airway inflammation model. Nitric oxide 
production, expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, and IRAK-1, 
TAK-1, and MAPK pathways were examined in PM4-stimulated MH-S cells. BALB/c mice 
exposed to PM4+D mixture by intranasal tracheal injection three times a day for 
12 days at 3 day intervals and KRGE were administered orally for 12 days. 
Histological of lung and trachea, and immune cell subtype analyses were 
performed. Expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung were measured. 
Immunohistofluorescence staining for IRAK-1 localization in lung were also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: KRGE inhibited the production of nitric oxide, the expression of 
pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, and expression and phosphorylation of 
all downstream factors of NF-κB, including IRAK-1 and MAPK/AP1 pathway in 
PM4-stimulated MH-S cells. KRGE suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration and 
number of immune cells, histopathologic damage, and inflammatory symptoms in the 
BALF and lungs induced by PM4+D; these included increased alveolar wall 
thickness, accumulation of collagen fibers, and TNF-α, MIP2, CXCL-1, IL-1α, and 
IL-17 cytokine release. Moreover, PM4 participates induce alveolar macrophage 
death and interleukin-1α release by associating with IRAK-1 localization was 
also potently inhibited by KRGE in the lungs of PM4+D-induced airway 
inflammation model. KRGE suppresses airway inflammatory responses, including 
granulocyte infiltration into the airway, by regulating the expression of 
chemokines and inflammatory cytokines via inhibition of IRAK-1 and MAPK pathway.

contagious enteric pathogen in the swine industry, which has evolved mechanisms 
to evade host innate immune responses. The PEDV-mediated inhibition of 
interferons (IFNs) has been linked to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) 
pathway. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in virus-host interactions and IFN-I 
regulation. However, the mechanism by which the PEDV regulates IFN during PEDV 
infection has not yet been investigated in its natural target cells. We here 
report a novel mechanism of viral immune escape involving miR-615, which was 
screened from a high-throughput sequencing library of porcine intestinal 
epithelial cells (IECs) infected with PEDV. PEDV infection altered the profiles 
of miRNAs and the activities of several pathways involved in innate immunity. 
Overexpression of miR-615 increased PEDV replication, inhibited IFN expression, 
downregulated the NF-κB pathway, and blocked p65 nuclear translocation. In 
contrast, knockdown of miR-615 enhanced IFN expression, suppressed PEDV 
replication, and activated the NF-κB pathway. We further determined that IRAK1 
is the target gene of miR-615 in IECs. Our findings show that miR-615 suppresses 
activation of the NF-κB pathway by suppressing the IRAK1 protein and reducing 
the generation of IFN-IIIs, which in turn facilitates PEDV infection in IECs. 
Moreover, miR-615 inhibited PEDV replication and NF-κB pathway activation in 
both IECs and MARC-145 cells. These findings support an important role for 
miR-615 in the innate immune regulation of PEDV infections and provide a novel 
perspective for developing new treatments.","Copyright © 2022 Zheng, Li, Zhu, Wang, Yin, Zhang, Feng, Yin, Huang and Zhang.","DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1071394

prescribed in oral care. In oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line CAL27, orento 
significantly inhibited periodontopathogenic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoproteins (PAMP)-stimulated production of 
interleukin (IL)-6. This suggests that orento negatively regulates PAMP-mediated 
toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Orento significantly suppressed 
PAMP-stimulated activation of the IL-6 promoter, indicating that orento may 
suppress the production of IL-6 by PAMP at the transcriptional level. Orento 
also suppressed TLR-mediated activation of transcription factor nuclear 
factor-kappa B (NF-kB) that was stimulated by PAMP. This finding indicates that 
orento may suppress the function and activation of factors involved in TLR 
signaling, thereby suppressing NF-kB-dependent expression of various genes. 
Orento suppressed IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK4), IRAK1, and c-Jun 
N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in PAMP-stimulated CAL27 cells. This 
result indicates that orento is involved in the initiation of TLR signaling by 
PAMP and suppresses the downstream signaling pathways of myeloid differentiation 
primary response gene 88 (MyD88) such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)

pathophysiological responses of adipose tissue (AT) in metabolic disorders such 
as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We previously showed association of the AT 
SRA1 expression with inflammatory cytokines/chemokines involved in metabolic 
derangement. However, the relationship between altered adipose expression of 
SRA1 and the innate immune Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as players in nutrient 
sensing and metabolic inflammation as well as their downstream signaling 
partners, including interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), remains elusive. 
Herein, we investigated the association of AT SRA1 expression with TLRs, IRFs, 
and other TLR-downstream signaling mediators in a cohort of 108 individuals, 
classified based on their body mass index (BMI) as persons with normal-weight (N 
= 12), overweight (N = 32), and obesity (N = 64), including 55 with and 53 
without T2D. The gene expression of SRA1, TLRs-2,3,4,7,8,9,10 and their 
downstream signaling mediators including IRFs-3,4,5, myeloid differentiation 
factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were determined using qRT-PCR and SRA1 protein 
expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. AT SRA1 transcripts' 
expression was significantly correlated with TLRs-3,4,7, MyD88, NF-κB, and IRF5

expression in all individuals, with/without T2D. SRA1 expression associated with 
TLR2, IRAK1, and IRF3 expression only in individuals with obesity, regardless of 
diabetes status. Furthermore, TLR3/TLR7/IRAK1 and TLR3/TLR9 were identified as 
independent predictors of AT SRA1 expression in individuals with obesity and 
T2D, respectively. Overall, our data demonstrate a direct association between 
the AT SRA1 expression and the TLRs together with their downstream signaling

IL-1β in modifying chemotherapeutic response and altering expression of proteins 
in novel AA and well-established CA colon cancer cell lines.
METHODS: RNA sequencing analysis was performed to detect expression of genes 
involved in inflammation in AA and CA colon cancer cells. The effects of IL-1β 
on 5-FU response was evaluated by assessing cell viability (MTS assay) and 
apoptosis (flow cytometry analysis) following treatment with 5-FU alone or in 
combination with the cytokine. Further, we used an IL-1 receptor antagonist 
(IL-1Ra) to inhibit IL-1β-induced effects on 5-FU sensitivity and NF-kB pathway 
activation.
RESULTS: AA colon cancer cell lines present significant increase in expression 
of genes IL1R2 (373-fold change (FC), IRAK1 (3.24 FC), IKBKB, (5.33 FC) NF-KB IA 
(5.95 FC), MYD88, (3.72 FC), IRAK3 (161 FC), TRAF5 (4.1 FC). A significant 
decrease in the response to 5-FU treatment, as well as a significant increase in 
phosphorylation of IκBα and secretion of IL-8, was seen following IL-1β 
treatment, in both AA and CA cell lines. Finally, treatment with IL-1Ra was able 
to reverse the effects induced by IL-1β, by increasing the cells sensitivity to 
5-FU. IL-1Ra also inhibited phosphorylation of IκBα and IL-8 secretion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a differential expression of inflammatory genes 
and proteins that might regulate the different response to IL-1β between AA and 
CA colon cancer cell lines. Our data also demonstrates that IL-1β is involved in 
modulating 5-FU response in both AA and CA colon cancer cell lines. Further 
investigation of these mechanisms might help elucidate the differences seen in 
incidence, mortality and response to therapy in AA colon cancer patients.","Copyright © 2022 Spagnardi, Paredes, Zabaleta, Garai, Reyes, Martello and

classified as functional constipation. If not effectively treated, 20% of 
patients with childhood constipation can continue to exhibit symptoms into 
adulthood, which seriously affects their mental health and quality of life. The 
main feature of acupuncture or acupoint stimulation, a special branch of 
traditional Chinese medicine, is the selection of different acupoints for 
different diseases, and many worthy guidelines have been established for 
matching acupoints. The back-shu and front-mu point combination adheres to an 
important acupoint compatibility law that has been used since its proposal 2,500 
years ago but has not yet been verified by the modern evidence-based 
experiments. This study focused on the back-shu and front-mu point combination 
using the Dachangshu (BL25) and Tianshu (ST25) points as examples to explore 
possible research methods for network acupoint-based stimulation based on 
existing evidence and to elucidate the mechanisms induced by BL25 and ST25 in 
the treatment of functional constipation in children (FCC). The study found that 
BL25 and ST25 have 20 common targets, namely, AQP8, DRD2, VIP, TAC1, IL6R, TNF, 
FOS, KIT, CHAT, HTR3A, GAS8, SOD3, TRPV1, MPO, CALCA, IL1B, P2RX7, NPY2R, 
IL10RA, and TPH1, and these targets may provide a strategy for the combined 
usage of BL25 and ST25. In addition, BL25 and ST25 can affect FCC treatment 
through inflammation-relatedTh17-cell differentiation, the NF-kappa B signaling 
pathway, and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Adipocytokines or leptin 
may also comprise the mechanism through which BL25 and ST25 regulate FCC. In 
addition, BL25 and ST25 regulate FCC through 13 core targets, namely, NFKBIA, 
RELA, TNF, IKBKB, IRAK1, TLR4, MYD88, TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, TLR2, IL1B, TRAF6, and 
TNFRSF1B. In short, this study provides new ideas and methods for studying the

derivatives of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (AK7 and AK9) in rats. The compounds were 
characterized by NMR and FTIR spectroscopies and their acute anti-inflammatory 
effects were measured by carrageenan (CRG)-induced paw edema model. The most 
potent doses of AK7 and AK9 were subsequently evaluated in the complete Freund's 
adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory arthritis model. AK7 and AK9 inhibited 
CRG-induced inflammation in a dose-dependent fashion and a similar reduction in 
CFA-induced paw inflammation was observed. Moreover, X-ray and histopathological 
analyses of AK7-treated animals displayed normal joint structure whereas AK9, 
despite of its anti-inflammatory effects, failed to protect against cartilage 
destruction. Interestingly, biochemical analysis revealed a better safety 
profile for AK7 than for AK9 and methotrexate. Both compounds suppressed mRNA 
levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (IRAK1, NF-κB1, TNF-α, IL1B) while only AK7 
reduced the transcript levels of interstitial collagenase (MMP1). Molecular 
docking analysis of AK7 and AK9 with TNF-α and MMP1 also supported the 
experimental data. These findings clearly highlight the beneficial effects of 
AK7 in the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory arthritis.","© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

lowering, insulin synthesis, pancreas inflammation, and apoptosis in diabetes. 
Reproductive disorders are one of the diabetes-induced chronic complications. 
The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of tropisetron on 
diabetes-induced testicular inflammation, its signaling pathway, and mir146a. To 
this end, animals were assigned to the control, tropisetron, diabetes (DM), 
DM-tropisetron, and DM-glibenclamide groups. Streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) was 
intraperitoneally injected to provide diabetes. Tropisetron and glibenclamide 
were then administrated intraperitoneally for 2 weeks after diabetes induction. 
Testes histology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, 
ELISA, and immunohistochemistry assays were also performed. The finding revealed 
that tropisetron significantly improved diabetes-induced testis damages, lowered 
TLR4, TRAF6, IRAK1, NF-κB, and caspase3 protein expressions, and decreased TNF-α 
and IL-1 levels. Moreover, the mir146a expression declined following the 
tropisetron treatment. This study demonstrated that the significant role of 
tropisetron in lowering testicular inflammation and apoptosis might have been 
due to the inhibition of the TLR4/IRAK1/TRAF6 signaling pathway and thereby the 
attenuation of NF-κB and caspase3 expression and inflammatory cytokines. 
Furthermore, the downregulation of mir146a, as an inflammatory microRNA 
interacting with TLR4, showed another pathway, through which tropisetron 
improved diabetes-induced testicular injuries.",© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/jbt.23272

the pathogenesis is incompletely known. AH is often treated with 
corticosteroids; however, steroids may lead to considerable side effects. Using 
a mouse model of AH (experimental autoimmune hypophysitis, EAH), we show that 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is upregulated in the 
pituitaries of mice that developed EAH. We identified rosoxacin as a specific 
inhibitor for IRAK1 and found it could treat EAH. Rosoxacin treatment at an 
early stage (day 0-13) slightly reduced disease severity, whereas treatment at a 
later stage (day 14-27) significantly suppressed EAH. Further investigation 
indicated rosoxacin reduced production of autoantigen-specific antibodies. 
Rosoxacin downregulated production of cytokines and chemokines that may dampen T 
cell differentiation or recruitment to the pituitary. Finally, rosoxacin 
downregulated class II major histocompatibility complex expression on 
antigen-presenting cells that may lead to impaired activation of 
autoantigen-specific T cells. These data suggest that IRAK1 may play a 
pathogenic role in AH and that rosoxacin may be an effective drug for AH and 
other inflammatory diseases involving IRAK1 dysregulation.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms232314958

reported in several species of fish, but its receptor subunits, IL-18Rα and 
IL-18Rβ, and its decoy receptor, IL-18BP, have not been functionally 
characterized in fish. In the present study, IL-18Rα, IL-18Rβ and IL-18BP were 
cloned from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and they possess common conserved

of NF-κB only when pcDNA3.1-IL-18Rα/IL-1R1 and pcDNA3.1-IL-18Rβ/IL-1RAP were

despite advances in standard of care therapy, and the role of anti-inflammatory 
agents that inhibit the interleukin 6/JAK2 pathway is still being elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the oral JAK2/IRAK1 inhibitor 
pacritinib vs placebo in the treatment of adults with severe COVID-19.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial enrolled hospitalized adult 
patients with severe COVID-19 at 21 centers across the US between June 2020 and 
February 2021, with approximately 1.5 months of safety follow-up per patient. 
Data analysis was performed from September 2021 to July 2022.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to standard of care plus pacritinib 
(400 mg per os on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily on days 2-14) vs placebo, 
for 14 days.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was death or need for invasive 
mechanical ventilation (IMV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) by 
day 28. All-cause mortality and safety were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were randomized to pacritinib (99 patients; 56 
men [56.6%]; median [range] age, 60 [19-87] years) or placebo (101 patients; 64 
men [63.4%]; median [range] age 59 [28-94] years). The percentage requiring 
supplementary oxygen was 99.0% (98 patients) in the pacritinib group vs 98.0% 
(99 patients) in the placebo group. The percentage who progressed to IMV, ECMO, 
or death was 17.2% (17 patients) in the pacritinib group vs 22.8% (23 patients) 
in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.28-1.35; P = .23). Among 
patients with elevated interleukin 6, the rate was 17.5% (11 of 63 patients) in 
the pacritinib group vs 30.4% (21 of 96 patients) in the placebo group. The 
adverse event rate was similar for pacritinib vs placebo (78.1% [75 patients] vs 
80.2% [81 patients]), with no excess in infection (14.6% [14 patients] vs 19.8% 
[20 patients]), bleeding (8.3% [8 patients] vs 10.9% [11 patients]), or 
thrombosis (8.3% [8 patients] vs 7.9% [8 patients]). Rates of grade 3 or higher 
adverse events were lower with pacritinib than placebo (29.2% [28 patients] vs 
40.6% [41 patients]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study did not meet its primary end point in 
patients with severe COVID-19. Subgroup analyses may indicate specific 
populations with hyperinflammation that could benefit from pacritinib, although 
further clinical trials would be needed to confirm these effects.

systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It was reported that SLE was associated with 
an inflammatory response mediated by defective immune tolerance, including 
overproduction of autoantibodies, chronic inflammation, and organ damage. 
Previous reports stated paeoniflorin (PF) had an immunosuppressive effect. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the anti-inflammatory effect of PF in SLE 
and its underlying mechanisms. Followed by induced with lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS), the splenocytes and the isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes of MRL/lpr mice were 
divided into three groups: control group, LPS group, and LPS + PF group, 
respectively. MRL/MP mice were used as the control group (treated with distilled 
water). The MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided into three groups: the model 
group (treated with distilled water), the prednisone group, and the PF group. 
The MRL/lpr mice were treated with prednisone acetate (5 mg/kg) and PF (25, 50, 
and 75 mg/kg) for eight weeks. Subsequently, ELISA, qRT-PCR, western blotting, 
HE, and Masson staining were performed to detect various indicators. The results 
of Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) showed that 10 μg/mL of LPS had the optimum 
effect on cell viability, and 50 μmol/L of PF had no obvious cytotoxicity to 
LPS-treated cells. PF reduced the expression level of IRAK1-nuclearfactor-κB 
(NF-κB) and its downstream inflammatory cytokines in the splenocytes and CD4+ T 
lymphocytes of MRL/lpr mice stimulated by LPS, especially in the latter. The 
serum antibody contents in the PF group mice were reduced, and the kidney damage 
was also alleviated accordingly. Moreover, the IRAK1/inhibitor of the nuclear 
factor-κB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB inhibitor (IκB)/NF-κB pathways was found to be 
involved in the anti-inflammation effect of PF in the kidney and spleen. In 
conclusion, it is thought that PF may have the potential to be used as a 
therapeutic agent to reduce the inflammatory activity of SLE. Inhibition of the 
IRAK1-NF-κB pathway may help formulate novel therapeutic tactics for SLE.",Copyright © 2022 Lina Ji et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2022/5161890

receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) in the diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted 
therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. A systematic analysis based on the cancer 
genome atlas (TCGA) indicated that IRAK1 was highly expressed in 18 cancer types 
(p < 0.01) and may be a pan-cancer biomarker. In hepatocellular carcinoma, the 
alteration rate of IRAK1 was rather high (62.4%), in which mRNA high relative to 
normal predominated (58.9%). Higher expression was associated with shorter 
overall survival (p < 0.01). IRAK1 expression correlated positively with 
pathology stage and tumor grade (for the latter there was only a slight trend). 
Interestingly, it correlated positively with TP53 mutation (p < 0.001), 
suggesting a possible strategy for targeting TP53 via IRAK1. 
Immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed a higher positive rate of IRAK1 in 
carcinoma than in para-carcinoma tissues (χ2 = 18.006, p < 0.001). Higher tumor 
grade correlated with more strongly positive staining. Molecular docking 
revealed cryptotanshinone, matrine, and harmine as the best hit compounds with 
inhibition potential for IRAK1. Our findings suggest that IRAK1 may play 
biologically predictive roles in hepatocellular carcinoma. The suppression of 
IRAK1/NF-κB signaling via inhibition of IRAK1 by the hit compounds can be a 
potential strategy for the targeted therapy.","DOI: 10.3390/curroncol29110700

with MECP2/IRAK1 duplication syndrome present with recurrent and severe 
infections, accompanied by strong inflammation. Respiratory infections are the 
most common cause of death. Standardized pneumological diagnostics, targeted 
anti-infectious treatment, and knowledge of the underlying pathomechanism that 
triggers strong inflammation are unmet clinical needs. We investigated the 
influence of IRAK1 overexpression on the canonical NF-κB signaling as a possible 
cause for excessive inflammation in these patients.
METHODS: NF-κB signaling was examined by measuring the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines and evaluating the IRAK1 phosphorylation and 
degradation as well as the IκBα degradation upon stimulation with IL-1β and TLR 
agonists in SV40-immortalized fibroblasts, PBMCs, and whole blood of 9 patients 
with MECP2/IRAK1 duplication syndrome, respectively.
RESULTS: Both, MECP2/IRAK1-duplicated patients and healthy controls, showed 
similar production of IL-6 and IL-8 upon activation with IL-1β and TLR2/6 
agonists in immortalized fibroblasts. In PBMCs and whole blood, both patients 
and controls had a similar response of cytokine production after stimulation 
with IL-1β and TLR4/2/6 agonists. Patients and controls had equivalent patterns 
of IRAK1 phosphorylation and degradation as well as IκBα degradation upon 
stimulation with IL-1β.
CONCLUSION: Patients with MECP2/IRAK1 duplication syndrome do not show increased 
canonical NF-κB signaling in immortalized fibroblasts, PBMCs, and whole blood. 
Therefore, we assume that these patients do not benefit from a therapeutic 
suppression of this pathway.",© 2022. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s10875-022-01390-7

health if exposed to living and occupational environment. Although several 
studies have been conducted on lead exposure, little has been reported on its 
harm to mammary gland and its mechanisms. In view of this, our study is the 
first to verify that lead exposure could promote apoptosis and inflammation in 
mouse mammary tissue (in vivo) and cow mammary epithelial cells (in vitro). 
After establishing a lead exposed mouse model, the expression profile of mammary 
gland tissue was constructed by high-throughput sequencing technology. In the 
profile, 917 differentially expressed genes were screened, of which IRAK1 was 
up-regulated by 4.33 times. Then, from qRT-PCR, Western blot and Luciferase 
report, IRAK1 was found to promote the release of inflammatory factors and 
tissue apoptosis and could be a specific target of miR-146a. On the other hand, 
double luciferase reporter system and qRT-PCR predicted the existence of a 
binding site between circRNA-05280 and miR-146a sequence. Experiments such as 
immunohistochemistry, apoptosis and EdU demonstrated that circRNA-05280 could 
promote not only cell apoptosis but also the expression level of inflammatory 
genes. Nevertheless, the function of miR-146a is opposite to that of 
circRNA-05280. Specifically, circRNA-05280 can regulate the level of apoptosis 
and inflammation of mammary gland by binding miR-146a and releasing the 
expression of miR-146a on target gene IRAK1. This study concludes that 
circRNA-05280/ miR-146a/ IRAK1 signaling pathway could mediate the mammary gland 
damage resulting from lead exposure. Accordingly, it sheds new light on further 
exploration of molecular mechanisms of mammary gland tissue damage caused by 
lead exposure, the risk assessment of lead, and the mechanism of lead mammary 
gland toxicity.",Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114204

which matriptases are involved in periodontitis is unknown. In this study, we 
examined the antiperiodontitis effects of matriptase on Porphyromonas 
gingivalis-derived lipopolysaccharide (PG-LPS)-stimulated human gingival 
fibroblasts (HGFs). Matriptase small interfering RNA-transfected HGFs were 
treated with PG-LPS. The mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines

inhibited PG-LPS-stimulated MMP-1 expression. Additionally, we confirmed that 
the mechanism underlying the effects of matriptase downregulation involves the

disease caused by ischemia and hypoxia. The study is aimed at investigating the 
role of neuropeptides and the mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) in acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) treatment. Compared with the normal population, a 
significant increase in substance P (SP) was observed in the serum of patients 
with AMI. PGI2 expression was increased in the SP-treated AMI mouse model, and 
TXA2 expression was decreased. And PI3K pathway-related genes, including Pik3ca, 
Akt, and Mtor, were upregulated in myocardial tissue of SP-treated AMI patients. 
Human cardiomyocyte cell lines (HCM) treated with SP increased mRNA and protein 
expression of PI3K pathway-related genes (Pik3ca, Pik3cb, Akt, and Mtor). 
Compared to MI control and EA-treated MI rat models, Myd88, MTOR, Akt1, Sp, and

inhibiting IL-1 signalling with the IL1R antagonist, Anakinra, or the IL1β 
antibody, Canakinumab, prevents metastasis and almost eliminates breast cancer 
growth in the bone. However, these drugs increase primary tumour growth. We, 
therefore, investigated whether targeting other members of the IL-1 pathway 
(Caspase-1, IL1β or IRAK1) could reduce bone metastases without increasing 
tumour growth outside of the bone. Inhibition of IL-1 via MLX01 (IL1β secretion

novel strategy in prostate cancer (PCa) therapy. However, interleukin-1 receptor 
associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), a central effector of TLR signaling, has been shown 
to be responsible for resistance to radiation-induced tumor cell death. In order 
to better understand the function and epigenetic regulation of IRAK1 in PCa, we 
performed in vitro cell culture experiments together with integrative 
bioinformatic studies using the latest single-cell RNA-sequencing data of human 
PCa and normal prostate (NOR), and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We focused 
on key effectors of TLR signaling, the Myddosome-complex components IRAK1, IRAK4 
and MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88), and TRAF6 
(tumor-necrosis-factor receptor associated factor 6). In PCa, IRAK1-mRNA was 
specifically enriched in luminal epithelial cells, representing 57% of all 
cells, whereas IRAK4 and MYD88 were predominantly expressed in leukocytes, and 
TRAF6, in endothelial cells. Compared to NOR, only IRAK1 was significantly 
overexpressed in PCa (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p<2x10-8), whereas the 
expression of IRAK4, MYD88, and TRAF6 was unchanged in PCa, and IRAK1-expression 
was inversely correlated with a specific differentially methylated region 
(IRAK1-DMR) within a predicted promoter region enriched for H3K27ac (Spearman 
correlation r<-0.36; Fisher's test, p<10-10). Transcription factors with high 
binding affinities in IRAK1-DMR were significantly enriched for canonical 
pathways associated with viral infection and carcinogenic transformation in the 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes analysis. DU145 cells, exhibiting 
hypermethylated IRAK1-DMR and low IRAK1-expression, reacted with 4-fold 
increased IRAK1-expression upon combined treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine 
and trichostatin A, and were unresponsive to infection with the uropathogenic 
Escherichia coli strain UTI89. In contrast, PC3 and LNCaP cells, exhibiting 
hypomethylated IRAK1-DMR and high endogenous IRAK1-mRNA levels, responded with 
strong activation of IRAK1-expression to UTI89 infection. In summary, exclusive 
overexpression of IRAK1 was observed in luminal epithelial cells in PCa, 
suggesting it has a role in addition to Myddosome-dependent TLR signaling. Our 
data show that the endogenous epigenetic status of PCa cells within IRAK1-DMR is 
decisive for IRAK1 expression and should be considered as a predictive marker 
when selective IRAK1-targeting therapies are considered.","Copyright © 2022 Schagdarsurengin, Breiding, Loose, Wagenlehner and Dansranjav.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2022.991368

including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Exosomes are nanoscale lipid 
extracellular vesicles that mediate communication between many cell types. 
Notably, the roles of immune cell exosomes in regulating GI homeostasis and 
inflammation are largely uncharacterized. By generating mouse strains deficient 
in cell-specific exosome production, we demonstrate deletion of the small GTPase 
Rab27A in CD11c+ cells exacerbated murine colitis, which was reversible through 
administration of DC-derived exosomes. Profiling RNAs within colon exosomes 
revealed a distinct subset of miRNAs carried by colon- and DC-derived exosomes. 
Among antiinflammatory exosomal miRNAs, miR-146a was transferred from gut immune 
cells to myeloid and T cells through a Rab27-dependent mechanism, targeting 
Traf6, IRAK-1, and NLRP3 in macrophages. Further, we have identified a 
potentially novel mode of exosome-mediated DC and macrophage crosstalk that is 
capable of skewing gut macrophages toward an antiinflammatory phenotype. 
Assessing clinical samples, RAB27A, select miRNAs, and RNA-binding proteins that 
load exosomal miRNAs were dysregulated in ulcerative colitis patient samples, 
consistent with our preclinical mouse model findings. Together, our work reveals 
an exosome-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying gut inflammation and paves 
the way for potential use of miRNA-containing exosomes as a novel therapeutic 
for inflammatory bowel disease.","DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.159469

conditions underlying SLE. Methods: Eight-week-old MRL/lpr mice were randomly 
divided into a model group (n = 5), low-dose TP (TP-L) group (n = 5), and 
high-dose TP (TP-H) group (n = 5). Mice in these groups were gavaged with normal 
saline, low-dose TP solution, and high-dose TP solution for 8 weeks, 
respectively. The expression levels of anti-dsDNA, IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, and 
CREA, BUN, ALT, AST, ALB, and ALP indexes in the serum of mice were detected. 
The proportion of CD19+CD138+B220- cells in the spleen and the pathological 
changes of kidney tissue in the mice were also evaluated. The possible signaling 
pathways and microRNA (miRNA) targets of TP in the treatment of SLE were 
analyzed using network pharmacology. The expressions of TLR7 mRNA and miR-146a 
in Raji cells (a B lymphocyte line) were detected using qPCR before and after 
intervention with a miR-146a inhibitor. The protein expression levels of TLR7, 
MyD88, p-IRAK1, and p-NF-κBp65 were detected using western blot analysis. 
Results: TP could significantly decrease the levels of ds-DNA and IgG, alleviate 
pathological injury in renal tissue, and upregulate miR-146a expression in the B 
cells of MRL/lpr mice without obvious liver and kidney toxicity. Network 
pharmacology analysis showed that TP could mainly regulate the Toll-like 
receptor signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway, among others. miRNA 
target prediction suggested that TP could regulate miRNAs such as miR-146a. In 
vitro cell experiments further confirmed that TP could significantly upregulate 
miR-146a expression and downregulate the expression of TLR7 mRNA and protein 
levels TLR7, MyD88, p-IRAK1, and p-NF-κBp65. After intervention with a miR-146a 
inhibitor, TP had no obvious inhibitory effects on TLR7, MyD88, p-IRAK1, and 
p-NF-κBp65 expression. Conclusion: TP may exert therapeutic effects on SLE by 
regulating miR-146a expression, inhibiting the TLR7/NF-κB signaling pathway, and 
affecting B cell activation.","Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Zhang, Gao, Wang, Gao, Li, Sun, Wen and Xie.","DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2022.952775

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating result of 
neurological trauma with subsequent microenvironment dyshomeostasis that induces 
neurotoxic phenotype acquisition by astrocytes, exacerbating neurological 
function impairment. Exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem 
cells (hUCMSCs) have demonstrated essential therapeutic effects after central 
nervous system trauma. However, whether hUCMSC-derived exosomes exert 
therapeutic effects on neurotoxic astrocytes to facilitate SCI function recovery 
remains unclear. Additionally, the limited efficiency of single exosomes may 
restrict the optimization of exosomal biological functions.
METHODS: We first determined that exosomes reduce the deleterious effects of 
neurotoxic astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. Then, we identified critical 
functional microRNAs (miRNAs). miR-146a-5p was overexpressed in exosomes, and 
then, miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes were used to investigate the ability of 
exosomes to reduce neurotoxic astrocyte effects, preserve neurons and promote 
neurological function recovery in rats with SCI.
RESULTS: Cell counting kit-8 and neurite length analyses revealed that exosomes 
partially reduced the negative effects of neurotoxic astrocytes on PC12 cell 
viability and neurites in vitro. The exosomes also attenuated inflammatory 
responses, reduced the number of neurotoxic astrocytes and preserved neural 
tissue in rats with SCI. Immunofluorescence assays suggested that the number of 
neurotoxic astrocytes was rapidly increased by injury, reaching a peak 5 days 
post-injury (dpi) and returning to the normal level 14dpi. Exosomal miR-146a-5p 
was identified as the critical functional miRNA. Overexpression of miR-146a-5p 
in exosomes strengthened the biological function of the exosomes. Therefore, the 
modified exosomes exerted more powerful therapeutic effects than the unmodified 
exosomes, reducing the deleterious effects of neurotoxic astrocytes both in 
vitro and in vivo and promoting locomotor function of the hindlimbs in the rats 
with SCI. Through a series of gain- and loss-of-function experiments, Traf6 and 
Irak1 were identified as targets of exosomal miR-146a-5p. Ultimately, we found 
that miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes exerted their function by targeting 
Traf6/Irak1/NFκB pathway in neurotoxic astrocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes exerted a more powerful 
effect than unmodified exosomes to promote neurological function recovery in 
rats with SCI by targeting neurotoxic astrocytes. Therefore, 
miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes are promising therapeutics for SCI.",© 2022. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13287-022-03116-3

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), probably due to exacerbation of the 
inflammatory response that impairs the course of the disease. Microglia are 
mononuclear phagocytic cells located within the parenchyma of the central 
nervous system; these play a key role in the innate immune response against JEV 
infections. However, the involvement of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the 
inflammatory response during the early stages of JEV infection in BV2 cells 
remains. Here, we evaluated protein profiles and determined the role of TLR2 in 
the inflammatory response of JEV-infected BV2 cells. High-depth tandem mass tags 
labeling for quantitative proteomics was used to assess JEV infected-BV2 cells 
and compare immune response profiles at 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection (hpi). In 
total, 212 upregulated proteins were detected at 6 hpi, 754 at 12 h, and 191 at 
24 h. According to GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, the upregulated proteins 
showed enrichment for proteins related to the immune response. Parallel reaction 
monitoring tests, western blotting, and qPCR results showed that the adaptor 
protein MyD88 was not activated. The expression levels of key proteins 
downstream of MyD88, such as IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6 did not increase; however, 
the expression levels of PI3K-AKT did increase. By inhibiting key proteins 
(TLR2, PI3K, and AKT) we confirmed that JEV activated TLR2, thus resulting in a 
robust inflammatory response. Consequently, the TLR2-PI3K-AKT signaling axis was 
proven to play a critical in the early stages of the JEV infection-induced 
inflammatory response in microglia.","Copyright © 2022 Zhao, Gao, Zhang, Zhang, Xie, Nan, Feng, Ha, Li, Zhu, Li,

patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and platelets <50×109/L. Previous publications 
have characterized PAC's unique advantage of reduced myelosuppression. We 
conducted a retrospective analysis of the phase 3 PERSIST-2 trial to assess 
PAC's impact on anemia and performed in vitro analysis to explore PAC inhibition 
of ACVR1 (ALK2).
METHODS: This analysis included PERSIST-2 patients with platelet count 
≤100×109/L randomized to PAC 200mg BID, PAC 400mg QD, or best available therapy 
BAT. Transfusion independence (TI) was defined as no RBC transfusions and no 
hemoglobin level <8g/dL. PAC's activity against ACVR1 was assessed using the 
HotSpot assay from Reaction Biology Corporation. The activity of the 
JAK1/JAK2/ACVR1 inhibitor momelotinib was also assessed. IC50 was calculated 
using 3-fold serial dilutions starting at 10µM.
RESULTS: The analysis included 106 patients on PAC 200mg BID, 104 on 400mg QD 
and 98 on BAT. Patients at baseline, were severely cytopenic, with a median 
platelet count of 55×109/L. Among patients with baseline hemoglobin <10g/dL, the 
percentage who achieved ≥1g/dL improvement at any time through week 24 was 
higher on PAC than BAT (PAC 200mg BID: 15% (5/33); PAC 400mg QD: 23% (7/30); 
BAT: 7% (2/28). The percentage who achieved an increase of ≥2g/dL trended 
similarly: PAC 200mg BID: 9% (3/33), PAC 400mg QD: 7% (2/30), BAT: 4% (1/28)). 
Among patients receiving transfusions or with Hb <8 at baseline, the percentage 
who achieved TI at any point (evaluated at 12-week intervals) through week 24 
was greater on PAC 200mg BID (7/26, 27%) and PAC 400mg QD (6/24, 25%) than BAT 
(1/19, 5%). On duplicate assays, pacritinib was shown to inhibit ACVR1 with an 
IC50 of 23 and 11nM. Momelotinib's IC50 was 70 and 35nM in the same assay.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in hemoglobin levels and transfusion requirements was 
greater on PAC than BAT, in PERSIST-2. This anemia benefit could be due to PAC's 
ability to inhibit the iron regulator ACVR1, which has been linked to hepcidin 
reduction and anemia benefit. These data suggest an important role for PAC in 
anemic patients with myelofibrosis. This study was supported by CTI BioPharma.",Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/S2152-2650(22)01439-2

myelofibrosis (MF) and thrombocytopenia. Unlike the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib 
(RUX), which is used at lower doses in patients with thrombocytopenia, PAC has 
been studied at full dose regardless of platelet count.
METHODS: This analysis focused on PERSIST-2 patients with platelet counts ≤100 × 
109/L who were randomized to PAC 200mg BID and patients who received RUX on best 
available therapy (BAT) prior to week 24. Endpoints included percent of patients 
with 35% spleen volume reduction (SVR), 50% modified total symptom score (mTSS) 
reduction (based on early satiety, abdominal discomfort, night sweats, itching, 
bone pain, and rib pain), and improvement in disease symptoms measured by 
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Safety analyses were based on all 
treated patients; efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat 
population randomized at least 22 weeks prior to study end. The Fisher Exact 
test was used to describe differences in response. Logistic and Cox regression 
was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: Safety analysis included 106 patients on PAC and 44 on RUX; efficacy 
analysis included 74 on PAC and 32 on RUX (median total daily dose 10 mg). 
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, including median platelet 
count (55 vs 61 × 109/L) and percent receiving RBC transfusion (46% vs 43%). 
Patients treated with PAC vs RUX achieved higher rates of SVR (22% vs 3%, 
p=0.02) and numerically higher rates of mTSS response (35% vs 19%; p=0.11) and 
""much"" or ""very much"" improved symptoms (35% vs 16%, p=0.06) at week 24. Among 
RUX patients with an available PGIC measure at week 24, 50% reported either no 
improvement or worsening symptoms, while 76% of PAC patients reported 
improvement. The adjusted hazard ratio on PAC vs RUX was 0.46 [95% CI: 
0.15-1.43]. Bleeding occurred at similar rates (43% vs 41%) on PAC vs RUX. Fatal 
AEs occurred in 8% on PAC compared to 11% on RUX.
CONCLUSIONS: PAC yielded higher response rates and a similar safety profile to 
lower-dose RUX in patients with MF who have moderate or severe thrombocytopenia.

(IBD) is prolonged, excessive inflammatory response to stimulation factors, 
which leads to intestinal mucosal lesions. microRNA (miR)-146a-5p is broadly 
activated in the mucosal immune response. At present, the biogenesis, function 
and role of miR-146a-5p in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) during the 
pathogenesis of IBD remain elusive. The human colon cancer epithelial Caco-2 
cell line was cultured with 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-1β for 3 h to 
establish an in vitro IECs inflammatory model. Relative levels of miR-146a-5p 
and inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and IP-10) were measured by reverse 
transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. Transfection of 
miR-146a-5p mimic or inhibitor into Caco-2 cells was performed to identify the 
influence of miR-146a-5p on Caco-2 cell inflammatory factors expression. The 
targeting relationship between miR-146a-5p and interleukin 1 receptor associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1)/tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was 
predicted by TargetScan 8.0. The present study demonstrated that miR-146a-5p and 
inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and IP-10) were upregulated in a dose- 
and time-dependent manner in IL-1β-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Moreover, 
upregulation of miR-146a-5p negatively regulated the expression of inflammatory 
factors, but the downregulation of miR-146a-5p increased their expression. The 
results of the present study demonstrated that miR-146a-5p decreased the 
expression of the inflammatory factors through targeted downregulation of 
IRAK1/TRAF6. These results suggest that miR-146a-5p negatively regulates the 
IL-1β-stimulated inflammatory response via downregulation of the IRAK1/TRAF6 
signaling pathway in human IECs. Therefore, miR-146a-5p may act as an important 
diagnostic biomarker and treatment target of IBD.",Copyright: © Li et al.,"DOI: 10.3892/etm.2022.11552

reducing the incidence of atrial fibrillation remains unclear. We hypothesize 
that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor alleviated atrial remodeling in 
STZ-induced diabetic rats by targeting TLR4 pathway.
METHODS: A total of 42 rats were randomly assigned into three groups: control 
group (CON group); diabetes group (DM group): diabetes mellitus rats were 
established by 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneal injection; and 
diabetes + dapagliflozin group (DM + DAPA group): diabetic rats were given DAPA 
gavage administration (DAPA 2mg/kg/d for 4 weeks by gavage administration), 14 
rats in each group. Epicardial multiple-lead recording and intracardiac 
electrophysiology studies were performed to investigate the electrical 
remodeling in the heart and the atrial fibrillation inducibility in each group. 
Western blot analysis and real-time PCR were used to determine the protein and 
mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), 
nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and type I collagen (collagen I).
RESULTS: Compared with rats in CON group, rats in DM group showed marked 
myocardial fibrosis, ectopic pacing excitement, reduced conduction velocity, 
decreased cardiac function. TLR4/IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB, collagen I proteins 
expressions and incidence of atrial fibrillation (27.3%) were increased in DM 
group. Parts of these changes were reversed by treatment of DAPA. Incidence of 
atrial fibrillation was decreased in DM + DAPA group (2.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: SGLT-2i dapagliflozin may prevent diabetic rats' atrial remodeling

therapeutics in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); however, drug 
resistance limits their utility and can lead to tumor ""flare-up"" and 
progression. In this study, we show that RCC resistance to sunitinib and 
sorafenib involves different mechanisms and leads to increased malignancy. 
Sunitinib decreased tumor growth and cell motility along with increased 
E-cadherin expression and secretion of the proangiogenic cytokines IL6 and IL8, 
which activated senescence in ccRCC cells and led to VE-cadherin 
phosphorylation, enhancing tumor angiogenesis. Sorafenib resistance increased 
the levels of mesenchymal markers and the secretion of MMP9, which cleaved 
VE-cadherin and disrupted endothelial cell integrity. Both sunitinib resistance 
and sorafenib resistance led to activation of the c-Met receptor IRAK1 and 
downregulation of the tumor suppressor MCPIP1, resulting in an increase in the 
metastasis of resistant cells, possibly due in part to enhanced vascularization 
of ccRCC. MCPIP1 overexpression partially overcame resistance to these drugs by 
decreasing micrometastasis and decreasing the expression of factors involved in 
tumorigenesis. In tumor samples from ccRCC patients, we observed a significant 
increase in the level of the c-Met receptor, IRAK1 and a decrease in MCPIP1 with 
respect to normal kidney tissue. Our results indicate separate novel mechanisms 
for sunitinib and sorafenib resistance, which both lead to MCPIP1 inhibition and 
ccRCC progression. The presented study suggests caution in the treatment of RCC 
with TKIs, which may lead to the unintended outcome of tumor progression.",© 2022. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41419-022-05251-4

to aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae were exposed 
to 0.01, 0.1, or 1 μM 2,4-DTBP for 6 d. Transcriptomic analysis of larvae 
revealed that biological processes related to anti-inflammatory function of 
macrophage M2 lineage were inhibited by 0.01 μM 2,4-DTBP. Decreases of 
transcripts related to the IL1B-MYD88-NF-κB pathway (i.e., il1b, il1rl1, myd88, 
irak4, irak1, traf6, ikbkg, nfkbia, nfkb) and protein levels of NF-κB in larvae

exposed to 2,4-DTBP were challenged with E. coli and showed higher survival 
rate, suggesting sustained activation of inflammation via LPS can be attenuated 
by 2,4-DTBP. Moreover, histological examination revealed that intestine barrier 
was compromised and there was an imbalance of intestine macrophage homeostasis. 
Food intake was also reduced following exposure to 0.1 and 1 μM 2,4-DTBP. In 
addition, a risk assessment revealed that 2,4-DTBP in surface water pose low to

endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. Previously, we found decreased 
SERPINA1 (alpha-1 antitrypsin) expression in endometriosis-like lesions in a 
mouse model of endometriosis, suggesting that it exacerbated inflammation in 
these lesions. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which SERPINA1 affects 
expression of inflammatory factors and development of endometriotic lesions have 
not been fully characterized. To investigate the role of intracellular SERPINA1 
in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), we performed RNA sequence analysis using 
RNA extracted from ESCs in which SERPINA1 was knocked down. The analysis 
identified several toll-like receptor (TLR)-related factors as being 
upregulated. Silencing of SERPINA1 increased expression of TLR3 and TLR4 in 
ESCs, as well as several TLR signaling pathway components, including MYD88, 
IRAK1/4, interleukin (IL)-1β, and interferon (IFN)-β. TLR3 or TLR4 agonists 
increased expression of inflammatory factors in SERPINA1-knockdown ESCs, whereas 
TLR3 or TLR4 inhibitors decreased expression. In addition, treatment with 
recombinant IL-1β or IFN-β increased expression of MYD88 and inflammatory 
factors in ESCs. Immunohistochemical analysis of endometriotic tissues showed 
that TLR3, TLR4, and MYD88 were localized in endometriosis lesions. Taken 
together, the data suggest that reduced expression of SERPINA1 induces 
expression of inflammatory factors by ESCs, which in turn are associated with 
TLR3/4, IL-1β, and IFN-β signaling. Regulation of intracellular SERPINA1 levels 
in ESCs may be a strategy to inhibit inflammatory responses in endometriotic 
lesions.","Copyright © 2022 Kusama, Satoyoshi, Azumi, Yoshie, Kojima, Mizuno, Ono, Nishi,

basic therapy for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with proteinuria. 
However, approximately 40% of patients have no response to RASi treatment. The 
aim of this study was to screen potential biomarkers for predicting the 
treatment response of RASi in patients with IgAN.
METHODS: We included IgAN patients who were treatment-naive. They received 
supportive treatment, including a maximum tolerant dose of RASi for 3 months. 
According to the degree of decrease in proteinuria after 3 months of follow-up, 
these patients were divided into a sensitive group and a resistant group. The 
plasma of the two groups of patients was collected, and the exosomes were 
extracted for high-throughput sequencing. The screening of hub genes was 
performed using a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) and filtering 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We randomly selected 20 patients in the 
sensitive group and 20 patients in the resistant group for hub gene validation 
by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate hub genes that 
predicted the efficacy of the RASi response among the 40 validation patients.
RESULTS: After screening 370 IgAN patients according to the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and the RASi treatment response evaluation, there were 38 
patients in the sensitive group and 32 patients in the resistant group. IRAK1, 
ABCD1 and PLXNB3 were identified as hub genes by analyzing the high-throughput 
sequencing of the plasma exosomes of the two groups through WGCNA and DEGs 
screening. The sequencing data were consistent with the validation data showing 
that these three hub genes were upregulated in the resistant group compared with 
the sensitive group. The ROC curve indicated that IRAK1 was a good biomarker to 
predict the therapeutic response of RASi in patients with IgAN.

the treatment response of RASi in patients with IgAN.","Copyright © 2022 Wu, Wei, Li, Gan, Zhang, Han, Liang, Zeng and Yang.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.978315

lacking. We have now further addressed this possibility by pharmacologically 
inhibiting or genetically inactivating the TLR pathway in murine CLL and human 
Richter syndrome (RS) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells. Surprisingly, we 
show that pharmacologic inhibition of TLR signaling by treatment with an IRAK1/4 
inhibitor delays the growth of the transplanted malignant cells in recipient 
mice, but genetic inactivation of the same pathway by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
disruption of IRAK4 or its proximal adaptor MyD88 has no effect. We further show 
that treatment with the IRAK1/4 inhibitor results in depletion of macrophages 
and demonstrate that these cells can support the survival and enhance the 
proliferation of both murine Eμ-TCL1 leukemia and human RS cells. We also show 
that genetic disruption of the B-cell receptor (BCR) by CRISPR/Cas9 editing of 
the immunoglobulin M constant region gene inhibits the growth of human RS-PDX 
cells in vivo, consistent with our previous finding with murine Eμ-TCL1 leukemia 
cells. Finally, we show that genetic disruption of IRAK4 does not result in 
negative selection of human CLL cell lines xenografted in immunodeficient mice.

potential for leukemic progression. Severe thrombocytopenia is common in 
patients with MF and correlates with poor prognosis; however, until recently, 
treatment options for these patients were limited. Pacritinib, a potent Janus 
kinase (JAK) 2/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) inhibitor, has 
demonstrated significant reduction in splenomegaly, improved symptom control, 
and a manageable safety profile in patients with MF regardless of the severity 
of thrombocytopenia.

from phase 2 and 3 studies that formed the basis for the recent US Food and Drug 
Administration approval of pacritinib in patients with MF and severe 
thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <50 × 109/L).
EXPERT OPINION: Pacritinib, with its unique mechanism of action targeting both 
JAK2 and IRAK1, offers patients with MF and severe thrombocytopenia a new 
treatment option, providing consistent disease and symptom control. Adverse 
events are easily manageable. Further analyses to identify ideal patient 
characteristics for pacritinib and other JAK inhibitors along with studies of 
pacritinib combinations are warranted, including in related myeloid 
malignancies.","DOI: 10.1080/17474086.2022.2112565

oleander is a plant known to be toxic and consumed due to the cardiac glycosides 
it contains. Oleandrin is a cardiac glycoside obtained from of N. oleander. 
Beside capable of inhibiting proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells, 
cardiac glycoside derivative compounds cause cardiovascular side effects. 
Because of cardiovascular toxicity of clinically used cardiac glycosides, it is 
necessary to investigate cardiac glycoside derivative compounds capable of 
inhibiting proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. It is known that 
oleandrin has anticarcinogenic effects in other cancers. Previous studies have 
shown that toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their related microRNAs (miRNAs) are 
associated with cancer. Therefore, aim was to investigate the effect of 
oleandrin on genes and miRNAs associated with TLRs in A375 melanoma cells in 
this study. The effects of oleandrin on cell viability, cytokines, apoptosis 
were evaluated using XTT, ELISA and TUNEL analyses, respectively. The effect of 
oleandrin on expression of TLR genes and 5 associated miRNAs in A375 cells has 
been determined by qRT-PCR. In addition, the levels of MyD88, TLR2 and TLR4 
proteins were analyzed by western blot method. ELISA indicated that oleandrin 
treatment (47 nM at 48 h) reduced the level of proinflammatory cytokine IFNG. 
TUNEL analysis showed that apoptosis rate was significantly increased in the 
oleandrin dose group. According to qRT-PCR results, there was a significant 
decrease in IRAK1, IRAK4, MyD88, TLR2-TLR7 and TRAF3 expressions in the 
oleandrin treated group compared to the control (untreated cell). Also, a 
significant decrease in TLR4 protein expression has been observed. In addition, 
oleandrin significantly downregulated the levels of hsa-miRNA-146a-5p and 
hsa-miRNA-21-5p. In conclusion, it has been observed that oleandrin has an 
effect on TLR pathway-related genes and miRNAs in melanoma cells. We show that 
TLRs pathways and hsa-miR-146a-5p and hsa-miR-21-5p can participate in the 
oleandrin molecular mechanism of action.",Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.gene.2022.146805

causing sex-biased outcomes are likely to have hormonal and genetic components, 
in which X-linked genetic polymorphisms may play distinct roles because of 
X-linked inheritance, hemizygosity in males, and X chromosome mosaicism in 
females. The study aimed to elucidate the contribution of biological sex and the 
common X-linked IRAK1 haplotype to posttrauma clinical complications, 
inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, and polymorphonuclear cell and 
monocyte activation. Postinjury clinical outcome was tested in 1507 trauma 
patients (1,110 males, 397 females) after stratification by sex or the variant 
IRAK1 haplotype. Males showed a three- to fivefold greater frequency of 
posttrauma sepsis, but similar mortality compared to females. Stratification by 
the variant IRAK1 haplotype revealed increased pneumonia and urinary tract 
infection in Wild type (WT) versus variant IRAK1 males, whereas increased 
respiratory failures in variant versus WT females. Cytokine/chemokine profiles 
were tested in whole blood from a subset of patients (n = 81) and healthy 
controls (n = 51), which indicated sex-related differences in ex vivo 
lipopolysaccharide responsiveness manifesting in a 1.5- to 2-fold increased 
production rate of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-10, 
Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1 Alpha, and MIP1β in WT male compared to WT 
female trauma patients. Variant IRAK1 decreased IL-6, IL-8, and interferon 
gamma-induced protein 10 production in male trauma subjects compared to WT, 
whereas cytokine/chemokine responses were similar in variant IRAK1 and WT female 
trauma subjects. Trauma-induced and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated 
polymorphonuclear cell and monocyte activation determined by using a set of 
cluster of differentiation markers and flow cytometry were not influenced by sex

responses to various microbiological components are initiated via different TLR 
proteins, but all TLR signals are transmitted by TRAF6. We reported that TRAF6 
associated with ubiquitinated IRAK-1 undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation, 
suggesting that IRAK-1 has a negative regulatory role in TLR signaling. Here, we 
investigated the minimal structural region of IRAK-1 needed for degradation of 
TRAF6. The IRAK-1 protein contains an N-terminal death domain (DD; amino acids 
1-102), a serine/proline/threonine-rich ProST domain (amino acids 103-197), a 
central kinase domain with an activation loop (amino acids 198-522), and the 
C-terminal C1 and C2 domains (amino acids 523-712), which contain two and one 
putative TRAF6-binding (TB) sites, respectively. TRAF6 degradation was severely 
impaired by deletion of the DD or C1 domain, and a mutant (DC1) containing only 
the DD and C1 domains could induce TRAF6 degradation. IRAK-1 mutants lacking the 
N- or C-terminal amino acids of DD induced little degradation. Deletion or 
mutation of TB2 (amino acids 585-591) in the C1 domain also inhibited TRAF6 
degradation. An IRAK-1 mutant possessing only DD and TB2 did not induce TRAF6 
degradation, although a mutant in which a short spacer was inserted between DD 
and TB2 induced TRAF6 degradation, which and DC1-induced degradation were 
inhibited by proteasome inhibitors. All IRAK-1 mutants that induced TRAF6 
degradation could be immunoprecipitated with TRAF6. Meanwhile, NF-κB activation 
was observed for all IRAK-1 mutants-including those that failed to induce 
degradation and was severely impaired only for a mutant carrying mutations in 
both TBs of C1. These results demonstrate that only DD and TB2 separated by an 
appropriate distance can induce TRAF6 degradation. Conformational analysis of

asthma. Current asthma medications have limited efficacy in treating fibrosis, 
particularly in patients with severe asthma, necessitating a deeper 
understanding of the fibrotic mechanisms. The NF-κB pathway is key to airway 
inflammation in asthma, as it regulates the activity of multiple 
pro-inflammatory mediators that contribute to airway pathology. Bcl10 is a 
well-known upstream mediator of the NF-κB pathway that has been linked to 
fibrosis in other disease models. Therefore, we investigated Bcl10-mediated 
NF-κB activation as a potential pathway regulating fibrotic signaling in severe 
asthmatic fibroblasts. We demonstrate here the elevated protein expression of 
Bcl10 in bronchial fibroblasts and bronchial biopsies from severe asthmatic 
patients when compared to non-asthmatic individuals. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
induced the increased expression of the pro-fibrotic cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and 
TGF-β1 in bronchial fibroblasts, and this induction was associated with the 
activation of Bcl10. Inhibition of the Bcl10-mediated NF-κB pathway using an 
IRAK1/4 selective inhibitor abrogated the pro-fibrotic signaling induced by LPS. 
Thus, our study indicates that Bcl10-mediated NF-κB activation signals increased 
pro-fibrotic cytokine expression in severe asthmatic airways. This reveals the 
therapeutic potential of targeting Bcl10 signaling in ameliorating inflammation 
and fibrosis, particularly in severe asthmatic individuals.","DOI: 10.3390/biomedicines10071716

system and are associated with high mortality. This current study examined the 
regulatory relationship between interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1), NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, and 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the growth and metastasis of HCC.
METHODS: The expression of IRAK1 and NLRP3 was assessed in tissues and cells via 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot 
analysis. Immunohistology was performed to detect the macrophage markers CD68, 
CD163, and CD168 in tumor tissues. Small interfering (si)RNA targeting IRAK1 
(si-IRAK1) was designed to silence IRAK1 expression. Following si-IRAK1 
transfection and/or co-culture with TAMs, HCC cell viability, proliferation, 
migration, and invasion, as well as the expression of NLRP3 and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines IL-1 β, IL-18, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) were 
assessed.
RESULTS: HCC tissues showed elevated expression of IRAK1 and NLRP3, as well as 
increased expression of the macrophage markers CD68, CD163, and CD168, compared 
to adjacent healthy tissues. Silencing of IRAK1 expression in HepG2 and Huh7 
cells resulted in suppression of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, 
and also reduced expression of NLRP3 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, 
IL-18, and MCP-1. Moreover, TAMs promoted HepG2 and Huh7 cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion, and elevated the expression of NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, and 
MCP-1. Furthermore, IRAK1 silencing reversed the effects of TAMs on HepG2 and 
Huh7 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of IRAK1 was associated with HCC growth and 
metastasis, as well as NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The ability of TAMs to 
promote HCC growth and metastasis may be activated by NLRP3 inflammasomes and 
regulated by IRAK1.",2022 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jgo-22-471

downstream of many TLRs and the IL-1R. Its potential as a drug target for 
chronic inflammatory diseases is underappreciated. To study its functional role 
in joint inflammation, we generated a mouse model expressing a functionally 
inactive IRAK1 (IRAK1 kinase deficient, IRAK1KD), which also displayed reduced 
IRAK1 protein expression and cell type-specific deficiencies of TLR signaling. 
The serum transfer model of arthritis revealed a potentially novel role of IRAK1 
for disease development and neutrophil chemoattraction exclusively via its 
activity in nonhematopoietic cells. Consistently, IRAK1KD synovial fibroblasts 
showed reduced secretion of neutrophil chemoattractant chemokines following 
stimulation with IL-1β or human synovial fluids from patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and gout. Together with patients with RA showing prominent IRAK1 
expression in fibroblasts of the synovial lining, these data suggest that 
targeting IRAK1 may be therapeutically beneficial. As pharmacological inhibition 
of IRAK1 kinase activity had only mild effects on synovial fibroblasts from mice 
and patients with RA, targeted degradation of IRAK1 may be the preferred 
pharmacologic modality. Collectively, these data position IRAK1 as a central

have shown attractive application prospects in acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI). However, the weak efficacy becomes their main limitation in clinical 
translation. Based on the anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis effects of a 
Chinese medicine-Tongxinluo (TXL), we aimed to explore the effects of 
TXL-pretreated MSCs (MSCsTXL) in enhancing cardiac repair and further 
investigated the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: MSCsTXL or MSCs and the derived exosomes (MSCsTXL-exo or MSCs-exo) were 
collected and injected into the infarct zone of rat hearts. In vivo, the 
anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammation effects, and cardiac functional and 
histological recovery were evaluated. In vitro, the apoptosis was evaluated by 
western blotting and flow cytometry. miRNA sequencing was utilized to identify 
the significant differentially expressed miRNAs between MSCsTXL-exo and 
MSCs-exo, and the miRNA mimics and inhibitors were applied to explore the 
specific mechanism.
RESULTS: Compared to MSCs, MSCsTXL enhanced cardiac repair with reduced 
cardiomyocytes apoptosis and inflammation at the early stage of AMI and 
significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with reduced 
infarct size in an exosome-dependent way. Similarly, MSCsTXL-exo exerted 
superior therapeutic effects in anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammation, as well as 
improving LVEF and reducing infarct size compared to MSCs-exo. Further exosomal 
miRNA analysis demonstrated that miR-146a-5p was the candidate effector of the 
superior effects of MSCsTXL-exo. Besides, miR-146a-5p targeted and decreased 
IRAK1, which inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 thus protecting 
H9C2 cells from hypoxia injury.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that MSCsTXL markedly facilitated cardiac 
repair via a new mechanism of the exosomal transfer of miR-146a-5p targeting

responses and autophagy in many diseases; however, its role in acute 
pancreatitis (AP) is not clear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression and role of miR-146a-5p in 
taurolithocholic acid-3-sulphate (TLCs) induced-AR42J cell model of AP.
METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western 
blot, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), miRNA mimics or vectors or 
small interfering RNAs transfection and dual-luciferase reporter assay were 
employed in this study.
RESULTS: miR-146a-5p was concentration-dependently decreased; while, 
interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor 
receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) were concentration-dependently increased 
after TLCs treatment. TLCs induced high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and impaired autophagy characterized as 
increased of LC3-II/I and decreased expression of p62. Overex-presion of 
miR-146a-5p and knockdown of IRAK1/TRAF6 inhibited TLCs-induced inflammation and 
autophagy. Luciferase assay confirmed miR-146a-5p can directly target IRAK1 and 
TRAF6. The expression of p-NF-κB p65 was increased by TLCs, decreased by 
miR-146a-5p overexpression and IRAK1/ TRAF6 knockdown but increased after 
upregulation of IRAK1/TRAF6.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of miR-146a-5p ameliorates inflammation and 
autophagy in TLCs-treated AR42J cells by inhibiting IRAK1/ TRAF6/NF-κB pathway.","© 2022 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.",PMID: 35777802 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathway, considered a new target for treating 
inflammatory diseases. Studies showed a significant correlation between TLRs and 
inflammatory responses in ulcerative colitis (UC). Therefore, in this study, 
after inducing experimental colitis in mice with 3% dextran sulfate sodium 
(DSS), different concentrations of IRAK1/4 inhibitors were administered 
intraperitoneally. Then, the disease activity index was assessed, including the 
degree of pathological damage, by HE staining. Subsequently, while western 
blotting detected the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and intestinal barrier protein 
expression (Zonula-1, Occludin, Claudin-1, JAM-A), real-time polymerase chain

Furthermore, the expression levels of Zonula-1 and occludin were detected by 
immunofluorescence, including the plasma FITC-dextran 4000 concentration, to 
evaluate intestinal barrier permeability. However, ELISA measured the expression 
of inflammatory factors to reflect intestinal inflammation in mice. 
Investigations showed that the IRAK 1/4 inhibitor significantly reduced clinical 
symptoms and pathological DSS-induced colitis damage in mice and then inhibited 
the cytoplasmic and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, including the 
phosphorylation of IκBα and reduction in downstream inflammatory factor

non-diabetic limbus has emerged as an important immune and inflammatory 
signaling mediator in corneal epithelial wound healing. Our aim was to 
investigate the potential inflammation-related miR-146a target genes and their 
roles in normal and impaired diabetic corneal epithelial wound healing.
METHODS: Our previous data from RNA-seq combined with quantitative proteomics of 
limbal epithelial cells (LECs) transfected with miR-146a mimic vs. mimic control 
were analyzed. Western blot and immunostaining were used to confirm the 
expression of miR-146a inflammatory target proteins in LECs and organ-cultured 
corneas. Luminex assay was performed on conditioned media at 6- and 20-h 
post-wounding in miR-146a mimic/inhibitor transfected normal and diabetic 
cultured LECs.
RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-146a decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory 
TRAF6 and IRAK1 and downstream target NF-κB after challenge with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or wounding. Additionally, miR-146a overexpression 
suppressed the production of downstream inflammatory mediators including 
secreted cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, and chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2 and 
CXCL5. These cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in normal but not in 
diabetic LEC during wounding. Furthermore, we achieved normalized levels of 
altered secreted cytokines and chemokines in diabetic wounded LEC via specific 
inhibition of miR-146a.
CONCLUSION: Our study documented significant impact of miR-146a on the 
expression of inflammatory mediators at the mRNA and protein levels during acute 
inflammatory responses and wound healing, providing insights into the regulatory 
role of miR-146a in corneal epithelial homeostasis in normal and diabetic

However, no immunological pan-cancer analysis of IRAK1 is available. We aimed to 
explore the prognostic value and the immunological functions of IRAK1. A series

showed that IRAK1 levels were upregulated in more than 20 types of cancers 
compared to the normal tissues. IRAK1 expression was associated with poorer 
prognosis in different cancer types. For the most frequent DNA alteration of 
IRAK1 is amplification. And the result of the enrichment analysis suggested that 
IRAK1 related to immune checkpoint pathway in cancer. IRAK1 inhibitor pacritinib

characterized by lipid metabolism disorder and vascular endothelial damage. 
Albiflorin (AF) has been certified to be effective in the therapy of certain 
inflammatory diseases, while the therapeutic effect and mechanism of AF on AS 
have not been fully elucidated. Material and Methods. Model cells for AS were 
created by inducing oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) in human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). After processing with AF and interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1- (IRAK1-) overexpressed plasmid, cell viability was 
assessed by CCK-8; cholesterol efflux was tested using liquid scintillation 
counter; IL-6 and TNF-α levels were determined with ELISA kits; ROS and 
apoptosis were confirmed using Flow cytometry. Besides, IRAK1-TAK1 pathway and 
apoptosis- and mitochondrial fusion-related proteins were monitored with western 
blotting analysis.
RESULTS: Our results verified that AF could not only dramatically accelerate 
viability and cholesterol efflux but also attenuate inflammation, ROS 
production, and apoptosis in Ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. Meanwhile, AF could 
prominently prevent the activation of IRAK1-TAK1 pathway, downregulate 
apoptosis-related proteins, and upregulate mitochondrial fusion-related proteins 
in Ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. Moreover, we testified that IRAK1 overexpression 
memorably could reverse suppression of AF on inflammation, apoptosis, and 
IRAK1-TAK1 pathway and enhancement of AF on viability, cholesterol efflux, and 
mitochondrial fusion in Ox-LDL-induced HUVECs.
CONCLUSIONS: By blocking the IRAK1/TAK1 pathway, AF can significantly slow the 
course of AS, suggesting that it could be a viable therapeutic option for AS.",Copyright © 2022 Yeling Liu et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2022/6584645

(#)Contributed equally","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by persistent 
synovitis, in which T helper 1 (Th1) can promote the development of a 
pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) has been 
identified as a promising biomarker of RA, while its molecular mechanisms in RA 
development are unknown. As a canonical RNA binding protein, we propose that 
PCBP1 could play roles in RA by affecting both expression and alternative 
splicing levels in Th1 cells. Here, microarray datasets (GSE15573 and GSE23561), 
including 102 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 39 RA patients and 
63 controls, were used to evaluate the PCBP1 expression changes in RA patients. 
High throughput sequencing data (GSE84702) of iron driven pathogenesis in Th1 
cells were downloaded and reanalyzed, including two Pcbp1 deficiency samples and 
two control samples in Th1 cells. In addition, CLIP-seq data of PCBP1 in Jurkat 
T cells was also analyzed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of PCBP1. We 
found PCBP1 were down-regulated in RA specimens compared with control. The 
result of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that Pcbp1 silencing in 
Th1 cells affected the expression of genes involved in immune response pathway. 
Alternative splicing analysis also revealed that PCBP1-regulated alternative 
splicing genes (RASGs) were enriched in TNF-a/NF-κB signaling pathway, T cell 
activation, T cell differentiation and T cell differentiation associated immune 
response pathways, which were highly associated with RA. DEGs and RASGs by Pcbp1 
deficiency in mice were validated in PBMCs specimens of RA patients by RT-qPCR. 
Investigation of the CLIP-seq data revealed PCBP1 preferred to bind to 3'UTR and 
intron regions. PCBP1-bound genes were also significantly associated with RASGs, 
identifying 102 overlapped genes of these two gene sets. These genes were 
significantly enriched in several immune response related pathways, including 
myeloid cell differentiation and positive regulation of NF-κB transcription 
factor activity. Two RA-related genes, PML and IRAK1, were screened from the 
above immune related pathways. These results together support our hypothesis 
that PCBP1 can regulate the expression of genes involved in immune response 
pathway, and can bind to and regulate the alternative splicing of immune 
response related genes in immune T cells, and ultimately participate in the 
molecular mechanism of RA, providing new research ideas and directions for 
clinical diagnosis and treatment.",© 2022. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-022-12594-7

superfamily and function as linkers that connect the actin cytoskeleton to the 
plasma membrane of cells. ERM also play critical role in the Lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced inflammatory response. However, the signaling mechanisms involved 
in this process remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the 
potential role of the rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 
(ROCK) pathway in LPS-induced ezrin phosphorylation and cytokine production in 
pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells.
METHODS: Cultured A549 and HPAEpiC cells were treated with LPS. The expression 
and localization of ezrin in A549 and HPAEpiC cells were then analyzed by 
western blotting and immunoflurescence. Activation of RhoA/ROCK was assessed by 
western blotting and RhoA activity assays. The interaction of ezrin with Syk and 
myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) was 
investigated by co-immunoprecipitation. The activation of nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was measured with 
electrophoretic mobility shift assays and by western blotting. ELISA and western 
blotting were performed to detect the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) release 
into the culture supernatant, and cellular HMGB1 levels.
RESULTS: LPS induced ezrin phosphorylation in a concentration- and 
time-dependent manner. The blockade of RhoA/ROCK inhibited LPS-induced ezrin 
phosphorylation and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. 
Co-immunoprecipitation assays further revealed that ezrin associated with Syk 
constitutively, but only associated with MyD88/IRAK-1 upon LPS challenge. 
Moreover, LPS-induced p38 and nuclear NF-κB activation was found to be ezrin 
dependent. The suppression of ezrin by siRNA or the blockade of ROCK activation 
with Y-27632 reduced the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and HMGB1 in response to 
LPS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism involving ezrin in 
the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and highlight the 
importance of the RhoA/ROCK-ezrin/Syk-MyD88/IRAK1 axis. Data presented in this 
manuscript provide novel insights into the signaling pathways activated in 
pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells by LPS. Video Abstract.",© 2022. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12964-022-00879-3

be tightly controlled to avoid an excessive inflammatory response that may lead 
to human chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Thus, how NF-κB signaling 
is precisely controlled is a long-standing question in the field. TRAF family 
proteins function as key adaptors to mediate NF-κB signaling induced by various 
receptors. Here, we characterize KIZ/GM114 as a negative regulator balancing the 
NF-κB signaling. Mechanistically, KIZ/GM114 binds TRAF6/2 by targeting the TRAF 
domains to antagonize the TRAF6-IRAK1 association or the TRAF2-TRADD 
association, consequently reducing the IL-1β/LPS/TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. 
Importantly, upon dextran sulfate sodium treatment, Gm114 deficiency induces a 
stronger inflammatory response, more severe acute colitis and lower survival 
rate in mice compared with control mice. Collectively, our study not only 
identifies KIZ/GM114 as a negative regulator to balance the NF-κB signaling, but 
it also implies a new strategy for limiting excessive inflammatory response.","Copyright © 2022 Sun, Yang, Liu, Chen and Sun.","DOI: 10.3389/fcell.2022.877039

pharmacological activities. In this study, we explored the anti-arthritic 
effects of newly synthesized acetamide derivatives of 2-aminobenzimidazole (N1 
and N2) in rats. FTIR and NMR spectroscopies were used to characterize these 
compounds. Carrageenan (CRG) induced paw edema model was used to test the acute 
anti-inflammatory activity of various doses (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg) of N1 and N2 
compounds. Based on acute anti-inflammatory effects, the most potent dose of 
each compound was selected and investigated in complete freund's adjuvant (CFA) 
induced inflammatory arthritis (RA) model (n = 4 in each group). 
Histopathological, hematological, radiographic, and RT-qPCR analyses were 
performed to assess the progression or resolution of inflammatory arthritis. The 
tested compounds produced a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity against 
CRG induced paw inflammation and similarly reduced edema in CFA induced 
inflammatory arthritis model. Histopathological and X-ray analyses of ankle 
joints revealed minimal inflammation and normal joint structures in N1 and N2 
treated groups. The tested compounds also reduced the levels of autoantibodies 
and restored hematological parameters. Interestingly, the tested compounds did 
not elevate aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels and 
displayed a better safety profile than methotrexate. N1 and N2 compounds also 
attenuated the transcript levels of IRAK1, NF-kB1, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL17 and MMP1. 
In addition, N1 displayed a greater inhibition of mRNA levels of COX1, COX2, 
mPGES1 and PTGDS as compared to N2. Our findings demonstrate that N1 and N2 
compounds possess strong anti-arthritic activity which can be attributed to the 
suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators.","© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland

deficits, neuronal loss, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and 
neuroinflammation in the brain. Hence, a multi-target drug would improve 
treatment efficacy. We applied a new multi-scale predictive modelling framework 
that integrates machine learning with biophysics and systems pharmacology to 
screen drugs for Alzheimer's disease using patients' tissue samples. Our 
predictive modelling framework identified ibudilast as a drug with repurposing 
potential to treat Alzheimer's disease. Ibudilast is a multi-target drug, as it 
is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist. In 
addition, we predict that ibudilast inhibits off-target kinases (e.g. IRAK1 and 
GSG2). In Japan and other Asian countries, ibudilast is approved for treating 
asthma and stroke due to its anti-inflammatory potential. Based on these 
previous studies and on our predictions, we tested for the first time the 
efficacy of ibudilast in Fisher transgenic 344-AD rats. This transgenic rat 
model is unique as it exhibits hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory 
deficits and Alzheimer's disease pathology, including hippocampal amyloid 
plaques, tau paired-helical filaments, neuronal loss and microgliosis, in a 
progressive age-dependent manner that mimics the pathology observed in 
Alzheimer's disease patients. Following long-term treatment with ibudilast, 
transgenic rats were evaluated at 11 months of age for spatial memory 
performance and Alzheimer's disease pathology. We demonstrate that 
ibudilast-treatment of transgenic rats mitigated hippocampal-dependent spatial 
memory deficits, as well as hippocampal (hilar subregion) amyloid plaque and tau 
paired-helical filament load, and microgliosis compared to untreated transgenic 
rat. Neuronal density analysed across all hippocampal regions was similar in 
ibudilast-treated transgenic compared to untreated transgenic rats. 
Interestingly, RNA sequencing analysis of hippocampal tissue showed that 
ibudilast-treatment affects gene expression levels of the TLR and 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathways differentially in male and female transgenic rats. 
Based on the TLR4 signalling pathway, our RNA sequencing data suggest that 
ibudilast-treatment inhibits IRAK1 activity by increasing expression of its 
negative regulator IRAK3, and/or by altering TRAF6 and other TLR-related 
ubiquitin ligase and conjugase levels. Our results support that ibudilast can 
serve as a repurposed drug that targets multiple pathways including TLR 
signalling and the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway to reduce cognitive deficits and 
pathology relevant to Alzheimer's disease.","© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

the X chromosome (Xq28) and is important for nervous and immune system 
functioning. Patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS) have recurrent 
respiratory infections (RRIs). Although RRIs often occur with MDS because some 
patients with MDS also have hypoimmunoglobulinemia and duplication of the 
interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase-1 gene (IRAK1), which is also located 
on Xq28, the phenotype of IRAK1 duplication in patients with MDS remains 
unclear.
METHODS: The clinical course of three patients with MDS who underwent 
laryngotracheal separation (LTS) at two institutions was summarized.
RESULTS: Three patients with MDS were identified to have recurrent pneumonia 
characteristic of aspiration pneumonia, sometimes requiring artificial 
ventilation therapy; they had no other bacterial infections. After LTS, they 
rarely had pneumonia. In MDS, MECP2 expression increased two-fold naturally, 
while IRAK-1 expression showed no difference compared with a healthy subject.
CONCLUSIONS: Since RRIs in MDS are thought to be caused by aspiration and not 
susceptibility to infection previously estimated to be major complication, the 
evaluation of aspiration is recommended for RRIs for better management of MDS.","Copyright © 2022 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier

carried out to investigate the modifying effects of hUC-MSC-exosomes on the 
differentiation and function of immune cells in SLE. hUC-MSC-derived exosomes 
were extracted from the cultural supernatant of hUC-MSCs by ultrahigh speed

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry were performed to estimate 
the effect of hUC-MSC-derived exosomes on macrophage and regulatory T cell 
(Treg) polarization. In vivo, hUC-MSC-exosomes were injected intravenously into 
28-week-old MRL/lpr mice. We had found that exosomes derived from hUC-MSC 
restrained the proliferation and inflammation of macrophages in vitro. Besides, 
MSC-exosomes inhibited CD68+M1 and HLA-DR+M1 but promoted CD206+M2 and CD163+M2 
in vitro. Moreover, MRL/lpr mice administrated by intravenous injection of 
MSC-exosomes had less infiltration of CD14+CD11c+M1 cells but more CD14+CD163+M2 
cells as well as Tregs in spleens compared with those in MRL/lpr mice treated by 
PBS. Additionally, MSC-exosomes could alleviate nephritis, liver and lung 
injuries of MRL/lpr mice. The survival of lupus mice could be improved after 
MSC-exosome treatment. This study has suggested that MSC-derived exosomes exert 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in SLE. MSC-exosomes ameliorate 
nephritis and other key organ injuries by inducing M2 macrophages and Tregs 
polarization. As natural nanocarriers, MSC-exosomes may serve as a promising

the clinical symptoms, risk factors, and pulmonary function tests. Exposure to 
cigarette smoke (CS), microbial infection stimulates monocytes and macrophages 
to rapidly synthesise and release inflammatory factors. A previous study of 
Trollius altaicus (TAF) revealed that it had significant anti-inflammatory and 
anti-oxidation effects on a pneumonia disease. Based on recent studies of the 
inflammatory pathway of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B 
(NF-κB), we will explore the influence of TAF on COPD.
METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into blank control group, Model 
Group, low-dose TAF + model group, middle-dose TAF + model group, high-dose TAF 
+ model group, positive control + model group. Except for the blank control 
group, COPD inflammation models were established in all groups by CS poisoning 
and LPS. Prior to the daily poisoning, 125 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg of 
TAF were administered by gavage in the low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, 
respectively, and dexamethasone solution (1 mg/kg, once daily) was administered 
continuously in the positive control group on the last 5 days of modelling. 
General signs, lung function indices, lung imaging results, complete blood 
count, lung histopathological changes, inflammatory factors in the alveolar 
lavage fluid, relative expressions of TLR4, IκB kinase α (IKKα), p65, as well as 
IL-1β proteins and their mRNA relative expressions were measured and compared 
between each group.
RESULTS: Compared with the blank control group, TAF effectively reduced 
pulmonary parenchymal oedema (wet-to-dry ratio) and respiratory secretions. It 
also significantly delayed lung function injury. Lung X-ray imaging and 
haematoxylin and eosin staining. Blood routine examination results showed that 
TAF effectively inhibited the increase of white blood cell, lymphocyte, and 
eosinophil counts, decreased the release of inflammatory cytokines [IL-1β, IL-6, 
IL-8, TNF-α, and transforming growth factor-1β (TGF-1β)] and promoted the 
release of IL-10. It also inhibited the relative expressions of TLR4, IKKα, p65, 
IL-1β proteins, as well as IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1), IKKɑ, p65, 
and IL-1β mRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention of TAF can reduce the occurrence of COPD, reduce 
the development of inflammation via TLR/NF-κB pathway, and provide reference for

Radiation Oncology, Xi'an 710061, China.","BACKGROUND: The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAK) family genes, 
indispensable mediators of interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) and Toll-like receptor 
(TLR)-inflammatory signaling, may be involved in the biological function of 
human cancers due to the crucial roles of inflammation in tumor development. 
Though a little research has demonstrated the function of individual IRAK family 
members in specific tumors, comprehensive analysis is still lacking in 
pan-cancer.
METHODS: We analyzed the mRNA expression landscape, mutation, and prognosis 
value of IRAK genes based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), cBioPortal, 
GlioVis, and Rembrandt databases. The correlation between the expression of IRAK 
genes and tumor microenvironment (TME), Stemness score, and immune subtypes was 
explored. Western blot, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration assays, and 
xenograft models were utilized in this study.
RESULTS: We found that the expression of IRAK genes extensively changed and was 
related to patient survival in pan-cancer. Besides, IRAK family genes were 
correlated with TME, Stemness score, and immune subtypes in most cases. Given 
that high expression of all IRAK family members predicted poor prognosis in 
low-grade glioma (LGG), the oncogenic function of the highest expressed IRAK1 in 
LGG has been confirmed in vitro and in vivo. IRAK1 was uncovered to inhibit cell 
apoptosis and augment malignancy of LGG in vitro and in vivo.

in pan-cancer and provided insights for further investigation of IRAK1 as a 
novel oncogenic gene in LGG.",Copyright © 2022 Jing Li et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2022/6497241

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. The vulnerable 
plaque of atherosclerotic can lead to the development of many diseases including 
acute coronary syndrome and coronary heart disease. It is well known that 
miR-146a is the key brake miRNA of the inflammatory signal transduction pathway. 
However, the effect of miR-146a on the stability of atherosclerotic plaque 
remains to be elucidated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We constructed animal models of atherosclerosis and foam 
cell models, and overexpressed and knocked-down miR-146a in models. After 
staining with Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE), Oil Red O, immunocytochemistry (IHC) and 
Sirius Red, we used the proportion of (Lipids area + Macrophage area) and (SMCs 
area + collagen area) to evaluate atherosclerotic plaque stability. TUNEL and 
flow cytometry were performed to detect the apoptosis level of macrophages. 
Levels of inflammatory factors were detected via ELISA assay. The results showed 
that miR-146a, IRAK1 and TRAF6 were abnormally expressed in plaques of 
atherosclerotic animals. Overexpression of miR-146a contributed to the stability 
of plaques that inhibited plaque formation, macrophage apoptosis and levels of 
pro-inflammatory factors. The Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, IF and FISH 
were used to verify the regulatory mechanism of miR-146a on IRAK1 and TRAF6. We 
found that IRAK1 and TRAF6 promoted lipid uptake, apoptosis, and release of 
pro-inflammatory factors of RAW264.7 macrophages, whereas miR-146a restored 
RAW264.7 macrophages phenotype by inhibiting IRAK1 and TRAF6 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: We display for the first time that miR-146a inhibits the formation 
of foam cells, RAW264.7 macrophage apoptosis and pro-inflammatory reaction 
through negative regulation of IRAK1 and TRAF6 expression, thereby enhancing the 
stability of atherosclerotic plaques.","© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","DOI: 10.1007/s11033-022-07253-z

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been identified to be implicated 
in the carcinogenesis and cancer progression. The present study was performed to 
probe into the effect of HDAC4 on radioresistance of esophageal carcinoma (EC).
METHODS: The expression of HDAC4 in responders and non-responders to 
radiotherapy was characterized by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western 
blot analysis. EC cells were exposed to continuous fractionated X-ray 
irradiation, and their proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by means of 
colony formation assay and flow cytometry based Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis 
assay in response to HDAC4 overexpression or silencing. Mechanistic 
investigation was conducted by means of in silico analysis and dual-luciferase 
reporter gene assay. Tumor xenografts derived from radioresistant EC cells were 
exposed to local X-ray irradiation in vivo for validation.
RESULTS: High expression of HDAC4 was detected in either tumor tissues derived 
from radiotherapy responders or radioresistant EC cells. Loss of HDAC4 
contributed to suppressed proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of radioresistant 
EC cells. Moreover, our findings revealed that HDAC4 conferred radioresistance 
of EC by downregulating microRNA-146a (miR-146a). Interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) was a target of miR-146a, and its knockdown 
promoted radiosensitivity. Silencing of HDAC4 radiosensitized EC cells both in 
vitro and in vivo via the miR-146a/IRAK1 axis.
CONCLUSION: Hence, loss of HDAC4 upregulated miR-146a to limit radioresistance.

radioresistance of EC.",© 2022. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-021-03171-z

and can increase susceptibility to infection, especially during the growth 
stage. This study aimed to explore substituting soybean meal with corn on 
activation of the TLR pathway and potential impact on immune response bias 
towards Type 1 or Type 2 using growing female goats as experimental animals.
METHODS: Twenty-four Xiangdong black goats (initial BW = 19.83 ± 0.53 kg, about 
8 ± 0.3 months old) were selected and randomly divided into the corn-soybean 
meal basal diet group (CON, 10.77% protein) and replacing soybean meal with 100% 
of corn group (CRS, 5.52% protein). EDTA whole blood and serum samples were 
collected prior to slaughter for determinations of blood cell counts, 
anti-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. The duodenum, jejunum, ileum and 
colon tissues were collected after formal trial to study the effect of CRS diet 
on the expression of TLR4 pathway.
RESULTS: Our results showed CRS diet did not induce a significant change in 
immune function, as evidenced by the observations that white blood cell (WBC), 
neutrophil (Neu), lymphocyte (Lym), monocyte (Mon), eosinophil (Eos), 
interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13, immunoglobin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM levels in 
serum were similar between the two groups. RT-PCR results showed the expression 
of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (P < 0.01) and interferon-β (IFN-β) (P < 
0.01) were up-regulated in the colon of goats in the CRS group. No differences 
in the expression of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) adaptor-like 
protein (TIRAP), IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), TNF receptor related 
factor 6 (TRAF6), NF-kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) 
or activator protein-1 (AP-1) in the TLR4/MyD88 dependent pathway were observed 
between the two groups for any of the tested tissue. However, the expression of 
NF-κB activator (TANK) binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in TLR4/MyD88 independent pathway 
was up-regulated in the duodenum and colon (P < 0.01), and the expression of 
interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) was up-regulated (P < 0.01) in colon.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the CRS diet failed to induce a 
significant change in innate immunity and adaptive immunity in growing goats. 
However, the up-regulated TBK1 and IRF3 in the colon from the CRS goats suggests 
that the CRS diet may induce the expression of Th1-type proinflammatory 
cytokines and inflammatory response through a TLR4-MyD88-independent pathway, 
and the colon may be the easiest targeted section in the intestinal tract.",© 2022 Cheng et al.,"DOI: 10.7717/peerj.12910

using immunohistochemistry, and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and ICAM-1 levels in the 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) using ELISA. Lung histopathological changes 
were observed in each group. NG-R1 treatment reduced miR-128-2-5p expression in

in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, we examined the association between SBL 
and variants of genes playing a critical role in both immune response and bone 
homeostasis among patients with RA.
METHODS: IRAK-1 rs3027898, IRAK-2 rs3844283, IRAK-2 rs708035, IFIH1 rs1990760, 
CD40 rs48104850, TNFAIP3 rs2230926, and miR146-a rs2910164 were genotyped in 176 
adult RA patients. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
RESULTS: Low BMD was observed in 116 (65.9%) patients. Among them, 60 (34.1%) 
had low femoral neck (FN) Z score, 72 (40.9%) had low total femur (TF) Z score, 
and 105 (59.6%) had low lumbar spine (LS) Z score. Among all the SNPs assessed, 
only CD40 rs4810485 was found to be associated with reduced TF Z score with the 
CD40 rs4810485 T allele protecting against reduced TF Z score (OR = 0.40, 95% 
CI = 0.23-0.68, p = 0.0005). This association was confirmed in the multivariate 
logistic regression analysis (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.16-0.59, p = 3.84 × 10-4). 
Moreover, median FN BMD was reduced among RA patients with CD40 rs4810485 GG 
genotype compared to RA patients harbouring CD40 rs4810485 TT and GT genotypes 
(0.788 ± 0.136 versus 0.826 ± 0.146 g/cm2, p = 0.001). IRAK-1 rs3027898, IRAK-2

CONCLUSION: This study for the first time ever demonstrated an association 
between a CD40 genetic variant and SBL among patients with RA.
KEY POINTS: • CD40 rs4810485 GG genotype is associated with decreased BMD among 
patients with RA. • CD40 rs4810485 might serve as a genetic marker for SBL in 
RA. • CD40 genetic variations might be integrated in future development of more

of the cases by mutations in the X-chromosome-localized MECP2 gene. To date, RTT 
is considered a broad-spectrum disease, due to multisystem disturbances 
affecting patients, associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions, subclinical 
inflammation and an overall OxInflammatory status. Inflammasomes are 
multi-protein complexes crucially involved in innate immune responses against 
pathogens and oxidative stress mediators. The assembly of NLRP3:ASC inflammasome 
lead to pro-caspase 1 activation, maturation of interleukins (IL)-1β and 18 and 
proteolytic cleavage of Gasdermin D leading eventually to pyroptosis and 
systemic inflammation. The possible de-regulation of this system, in parallel 
with upstream nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 pathway, were analyzed in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma isolated from RTT patients and 
matching controls. RTT PBMCs showed a constitutive activation of the axis TLR4 
(Toll-like receptor 4)-IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1)-NF-κB 
p65, together with augmented ROS generation and enhanced IL-18 mRNA levels and 
NLRP3:ASC co-localization. The deregulation of inflammasome components was even 
found in THP-1 cells silenced for MECP2 and importantly, in plasma compartment 
of RTT subjects, from the earliest stages of the pathology or in correlation 
with the severity of MeCP2 mutations. Taken together, these data provide new 
insights into the mechanisms involved in RTT sub-clinical inflammatory status

Endothelial adhesion molecules are involved in physiopathology of DN. 
Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and c-Myc participate in 
inflammation in DN. We hypothesized c-Myc modulates IRAK1 expression, 
contributing to hyperglycemia-mediated endothelial inflammation. The expression 
of endothelial adhesion molecules and IRAK1 were increased in glomerular 
endothelium of DN patients and rats. Our cellular experiments indicated high 
glucose-induced endothelial cell inflammation was inhibited by si-IRAK1. 
Additionally, high glucose increased c-Myc expression. si-c-Myc inhibited high 
glucose-mediated increase of IRAK1 levels and endothelial cell inflammation. 
c-Myc overexpression-mediated endothelial cell inflammation was counteracted by 
si-IRAK1. c-Myc also interacted with lysine methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A). 
Furthermore, high glucose decreased KMT5A expression and histone H4 lysine 20 
methylation (H4K20me1). KMT5A upregulation decreased high glucose-mediated 
increase of IRAK1 levels as well as endothelial inflammation. KMT5A 
silencing-mediated endothelial inflammation was reversed by si-IRAK1. 
Mechanistic research indicated that c-Myc and H4K20me1 occupied IRAK1 promoter 
region. KMT5A silencing augmented the active action of c-Myc on IRAK1 levels. 
Our in vivo experiments represented KMT5A is downregulated and c-Myc is

observed with tumor-infiltrating macrophages after interplay with cancer cells 
or/and other stroma cells. Our previous study indicated that macrophage 
M2-polarization can be induced by extracellular HSP90α (eHSP90α) secreted from 
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts. To 
extend the finding, we herein validated that eHSP90α-induced M2-polarized 
macrophages exhibited a tumor-promoting activity and the promoted tumor tissues 
had significant increases in microvascular density but decreases in CD4+ T-cell 
level. We further investigated the signaling pathways occurring in 
eHSP90α-stimulated macrophages. When macrophages were exposed to eHSP90α, CD91 
and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) functioned as the receptor/co-receptor for 
eHSP90α binding to recruit interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinases 
(IRAKs) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and next elicited a 
canonical CD91/MyD88-IRAK1/4-IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β)-nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB)/interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathway. Despite 
TLR4-MyD88 complex-associated activations of IKKα/β, NF-κB and IRF3 being 
well-known as involved in macrophage M1-activation, our results demonstrated 
that the CD91-TLR4-MyD88 complex-associated IRAK1/4-IKKα/β-NF-κB/IRF3 pathway 
was not only directly involved in M2-associated CD163, CD204, and IL-10 gene 
expressions but also required for downregulation of M1 inflammatory cytokines. 
Additionally, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) were recruited 
onto MyD88 to induce the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription 
factor signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3). The 
JAK2/TYK2-STAT-3 signaling is known to associate with tumor promotion. In this 
study, the MyD88-JAK2/TYK2-STAT-3 pathway was demonstrated to contribute to 
eHSP90α-induced macrophage M2-polarization by regulating the expressions of M1- 
and M2-related genes, proangiogenic protein vascular endothelial growth factor,

used to treat diabetes, rheumatism, gastrointestinal problems, inflammatory 
diseases, cough and respiratory problems in traditional practices. The primary 
objective of the study is to identify and isolate anti-inflammatory bioactive 
compounds from A.calcarata rhizomes and to assess its molecular mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bioassay-guided fractionation of methanolic extract 
of A. calcarata rhizomes yielded chloroform fraction as the effective fraction 
and galangin as the bioactive compound identified by NMR studies. The 
anti-inflammatory action of galangin was evaluated by determining NO and 
cytokine production in LPS stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Further, its mechanism was 
studied on the expression levels of mRNA and protein targets by qPCR and Western 
blot analysis.
RESULTS: Based on the MTT assay, the concentration of 3.1-25 μM of galangin was 
selected for further studies. Galangin reduced the levels of NO and 
proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) production in LPS induced RAW 
264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the qPCR analysis revealed 
a reduction in the mRNA expression levels of COX-2, IRAK 1 and JAK 1 in galangin 
treated LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot 
analysis implicated that galangin has markedly reduced the protein expression 
levels of cell signaling regulators (JAK-1, IRAK-1, MyD88, MAPK (p38 and ERK) 
and NF-κB p65).
CONCLUSION: From the results, it is evident that the inhibition of these cell 
signaling regulators has contributed to the anti-inflammatory effects of 
galangin. To our knowledge, we are the first to report IRAK-1 and JAK-1 as 
therapeutic targets of galangin for its anti-inflammatory effect.",Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2022.114975

therapy. Here, using a G0 marker (G0M), we narrow down CML LSCs as G0M- and

attenuate PD-L1 expression on CML LSCs, and blocking PD-L1 together with 
imatinib also effectively eliminates CML LSCs in the presence of T cell 
immunity. Thus, IRAK1/4 inhibitors can eliminate CML LSCs through inhibiting

IRAK1, TRAF6, IκBα, NFκB) after stimulation with LPS or histamine in a 3D in

quantified by qPCR and secretion of CKs and ChKs was evaluated by ELISA assay. 
LPS and histamine increased the relative expression of genes related to the TLR2

significant gene expression regulators and could be involved during the 
infections and also genetic alterations in the miRNAs sequence can affect 
primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs processing and thus alter miRNAs expression. 
Current research studied the impact of the miR-146a polymorphism on miR-146a, 
TRAF-6, and IRAK-1 genes expression in patients with brucellosis illness.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this research, 25 patients with brucellosis and 25 
healthy participants with determined genotypes for miR-SNP rs2910164 and miR-SNP 
rs57095329 were recruited. IRAK-1, TRAF-6, and miR-146a expressions in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were specified by quantitative real- 
time PCR (qRT-PCR). Moreover, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor- 
alpha (TNF-α) serum levels were assessed by a sandwich enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. There was no significant difference in 
the expression level of miR-146a, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6, among the patients with 
brucellosis and control group. TRAF-6 PBMCs expression levels in the distinctive 
genotypes of rs2910164 were significantly observed in patients (P = 0.048). No 
significant distinctions were found in miR-146a, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6 expression 
levels and among the rs57095329 different genotypes in brucellosis patients and 
controls. Meanwhile, no significant relationship was found between the rs2910164 
and rs57095329 genotypes and the serum level of cytokines mentioned between the 
two groups. We did not find any association between expression of TRAF-6, 
miR-146a, and IRAK-1 in PBMCs, and cytokines serum levels with two single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miR-146a.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of writers' knowledge, this research is the first one 
evaluating the probable link between the miR-146a rs2910164 and rs57095329 
variant with miRNAs, relevant cytokine levels, and target genes in brucellosis.","© 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","DOI: 10.1007/s11033-021-07014-4

meningitis. It penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and activates nuclear 
factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, which are vital events leading to the 
development of meningitis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated 
in regulating neuroinflammatory signaling, and our previous study showed that E. 
coli can induce differential expression of lncRNAs, including lncC11orf54-1, in 
human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). The hBMECs constitute the 
structural and functional basis for the BBB, however, it is unclear whether 
lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses of hBMECs 
during meningitic E. coli infection. In this study, we characterized an 
abundantly expressed lncRNA, lncC11orf54-1, which was degraded by translocated 
coilin to produce mgU2-19 and mgU2-30 in hBMECs during E. coli infection. 
Functionally, lncC11orf54-1-originated non-coding RNA mgU2-30 interacted with 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) to induce its oligomerization 
and autophosphorylation, thus promoting the activation of NF-κB signaling and 
facilitating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In summary, our study 
uncovers the involvement of lncC11orf54-1 in IRAK1-NF-κB signaling, and it 
functions as a positive regulator of inflammatory responses in meningitic E.

to atherosclerosis. Increasingly, evidence has demonstrated that interleukin 1

development of atherosclerosis. Recent large-scale clinical trials have 
supported the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory therapies targeting 
IL-1β and IL-6 in reducing atherosclerosis. The present study examined the 
pharmacological effects of IL-1R-associated kinase 1 and 4 inhibitors (IRAK1/4i) 
in regulating inflammation of the endothelium and atherosclerosis. We 
demonstrate that dual pharmacological inhibition of IRAK1 and IRAK4 by an 
IRAK1/4i is more effective against LPS induced endothelial inflammation, 
compared with IRAK1 inhibitor or IRAK4 inhibitor monotherapy. IRAK1/4i showed 
little endothelial cell toxicity at concentrations from 1 μM up to 10 μM. 
Inhibition of IRAK1/4 reduced endothelial activation induced by LPS in vitro as 
evidenced by attenuated monocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Mechanistically, 
blockade of IRAK1/4 ameliorated the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. To assess 
the pharmacological effects of IRAK1/4i on atherosclerosis in vivo, ApoE-/- mice 
were orally administered IRAK1/4i (20 mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks. We show that 
IRAK1/4i reduced atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic sinus and increased 
hepatic LDLR protein levels as well as lowered LDL-C level, without affecting 
other lipid parameters or glucose tolerance. Taken together, our findings 
demonstrate that dual pharmacological inhibition of IRAK1 and IRAK4 attenuates

macrophages infiltrated into the tumor microenvironment and to explore the 
underlying mechanisms whereby M1 macrophages influence the growth of OS, so that 
novel treatments of OS can be developed. A transwell co-culture system, an 
indirect conditioned medium culture system and two orthotopic bearing OS models 
were established to assess for the interplay between M1 macrophages and OS. We 
found that the co-culture of M1 macrophages with OS cells significantly 
inhibited the growth of the tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, 
HSPA1L secreted by M1 macrophages exerted this anti-tumor effect through the 
IRAK1 and IRAK4 pathways. LGALS3BP secreted by OS cells bound to the ligand 
LGALS3 on M1 macrophages and thereby induced the secretion of Hspa11 via Akt 
phosphorylation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the culture supernatant 
of OS-stimulated M1 macrophages significantly inhibited the growth of OS, 
whereas silencing Lgals3bp promoted the progression of OS. In conclusion, OS 
modifies the phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and thereby 
influences the apoptosis of OS cells through soluble factors. The modulation of 
TAMs may be a promising and effective therapeutic approach in OS.",Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.canlet.2021.12.023

University, Changsha 410011, Hunan Province, China.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common autoimmune disease with high 
incidence in females. The pathogenesis of SLE is complex, and healing SLE has 
become a serious challenge for clinical treatment. Aberrant expression of 
miR-301a-3p involves the progressions of multiple diseases, and some studies 
have indicated that increased miR-301a-3p could induce the inflammatory injury 
of some organs. However, the role and molecular mechanism of miR-301a-3p in SLE 
remain unclear. In this study, the miR-301a-3p levels in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the patients with SLE and health subjects were 
measured with qRT-PCR. The ELISA assay was used to investigate the effect of 
miR-301a-3p on the levels of inflammatory factors in PBMCs, and flow cytometry 
assays were used to observe the effect of miR-301a-3p on the levels of CD4+ T 
cells and Th17 cells in PBMCs. Moreover, TargetScan, dual-luciferase reporter 
assay, and western blot were used to reveal the downstream targets and 
regulation mechanism of miR-301a-3p in SLE. The results showed that miR-301a-3p 
was significantly upregulated in PBMCs of the SLE patients, and increased 
miR-301a-3p could boost the expression of IL-6, IL-17, and INF-γ in PBMCs and 
promote the differentiation of Th17 cells. It was found that PELI1 was a target 
of miR-301a-3p, and PELI1 upregulation could effectively reverse the effect of 
miR-301a-3p on PBMCs. Besides, this study also found that miR-301a-3p could 
promote the expression of IRAK1 to involve the progression of SLE via targeting 
PELI1. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased miR-301a-3p serves as a 
pathogenic factor in SLE to promote IRAK1-mediated differentiation of Th17 cells

flagellin A N/C (FlaA N/C) protein-mediated pyroptosis inhibition and related 
miRNA in radiation protection.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Mice received 10 Gy irradiation after FlaA N/C 
pretreatment, IRAK-1/4 Inhibitor I treatment, or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate 
treatment. Human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC) received 10 Gy irradiation 
after FlaA N/C pretreatment, overexpressed miR-142a-3p with miR-142a-3p mimics, 
or inhibited miR-142a-3p with miR-142a-3p inhibitor. Mouse & Rat miRNA OneArray 
determined the change in relevant miRNA after FlaA N/C pretreatment; real-time 
polymerase chain reaction detected IRAK1 and miR-142a-3p expression; a CCK-8 
assay evaluated cell viability; LDH release analyzed cytotoxicity; caspase-1 
activity assay, interleukin-1β level, and flow cytometry analyzed pyroptosis in 
cells; hematoxylin-eosin staining evaluated the damage to intestinal tissue; 
CO-IP detected the inflammation activation; immunohistochemistry, Western blot 
analysis, and immunofluorescence analyzed activation of pyroptosis-related 
proteins and the activation of NF-kB signaling pathways; and luciferase reporter 
assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization detected the interaction between 
miR-142a-3p and IRAK1.
RESULTS: FlaA N/C reduced radiation-induced pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro, and 
miR-142a-3p expression increased after FlaA N/C pretreatment. Upregulating the 
expression of miR-142a-3p inhibited radiation-induced pyroptosis in HIEC, and 
downregulating the expression of miR-142a-3p led to radiation-induced pyroptosis 
in HIEC after FlaA N/C pretreatment. IRAK1 was a direct target of miR-142a-3p 
and played an important role in radiation-induced pyroptosis in HIEC. Inhibiting 
IRAK1 reduced radiation-mediated pyroptosis in mice intestines. miR-142a-3p 
downregulated IRAK1 and suppressed the NF-kB pathway. Inhibiting the NF-kB 
signaling pathway can reduce radiation-mediated pyroptosis in mice intestines.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated this new radioprotectant protein regulates 
miR-142a-3p, effectively inhibiting radiation-induced pyroptosis mediated by the 
IRAK1/NF-κB signaling pathway in intestinal cells.",Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.12.003

myeloproliferative disease which can progress to acute myeloid leukemia and is 
associated with the coincident development of B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. SCLL 
is driven by the constitutive activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 
(FGFR1) as a result of chromosome translocations with poor outcome. Mouse models 
have been developed which faithfully recapitulate the human disease and have 
been used to characterize the molecular genetic events that are associated with 
development and progression of the disease.
METHODS: CRISPR/Cas9 approaches were used to generate SCLL cells null for 
Interleukin receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and interferon gamma (IFNG) 
which were introduced into syngeneic hosts through tail vein injection. 
Development of the disease and changes in immune cell composition and activity 
were monitored using flow cytometry. Bead-based immunoassays were used to 
compare the cytokine and chemokine profiles of control and knock out (KO) cells. 
Antibody mediated, targeted depletion of T cell and MDSCs were performed to 
evaluate their role in antitumor immune responses.
RESULTS: In SCLL, FGFR1 activation silences miR-146b-5p through DNMT1-mediated 
promoter methylation, which derepresses the downstream target IRAK1. IRAK1 KO 
SCLL cells were xenografted into immunocompetent syngeneic mice where the 
typical rapid progression of disease was lost and the mice remained disease 
free. IRAK1 in this system has no effect on cell cycle progression or apoptosis 
and robust growth of the KO cells in immunodeficient mice suggested an effect on 
immune surveillance. Depletion of T-cells in immunocompetent mice restored 
leukemogenesis of the KO cells, and tumor killing assays confirmed the role of T 
cells in tumor clearance. Analysis of the immune cell profile in mice 
transplanted with the IRAK1 expressing mock control (MC) cells shows that there 
is an increase in levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with a 
concomitant decrease in CD4+/CD8+ T-cell levels. MDSC suppression assays and 
depletion experiments showed that these MDSCs were responsible for suppression 
of the T cell mediated leukemia cell elimination. Immuno-profiling of a panel of 
secreted cytokines and chemokines showed that activation of IFN-γ is 
specifically impaired in the KO cells. In vitro and in vivo expression assays 
and engraftment with interferon gamma receptor-1 (IFNGR1) null mice and IFNG KO 
SCLL cells, showed the leukemia cells produced IFN-γ directly participating in 
the induction of MDSCs to establish immune evasion. Inhibition of IRAK1 using 
pacritinib suppresses leukemogenesis with impaired induction of MDSCs and 
attenuated suppression of CD4+/CD8+ T-cells.
CONCLUSIONS: IRAK1 orchestrates a previously unknown FGFR1-directed immune 
escape mechanism in SCLL, through induction of MDSCs via regulation of IFN-γ 
signaling from leukemia cells, and targeting IRAK1 may provide a means of 
suppressing tumor growth in this syndrome by restoring immune surveillance.",© 2021. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12943-021-01460-1

inflammation and alloreaction during acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), a 
common life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (allo-HCT). IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) regulates 
the activation of APCs in inflammatory settings, and inhibition of IRAK1 might 
decrease APC activation and aGVHD. This study was conducted to explore the 
impact of IRAK1 inhibition on APC activation and aGVHD in mice. We administered 
a selective IRAK1 inhibitor, Jh-X-119-01, to recipient mice undergoing allo-HCT 
or co-challenged by A20 lymphoma cells. We assessed aGVHD and the 
graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect. T cell and APC activations were analyzed as 
well. Jh-X-119-01 was associated with increased survival and decreased aGVHD of 
recipients. Jh-X-119-01 decreased the proportions of Th1 cells and Tc1 cells in 
the aGVHD model and in the in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction. The IRAK1 
inhibitor reduced production of TNFα and IFNγ in macrophages of recipient mice. 
In in vitro cultured bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs), Jh-X-119-01 decreased 
productions of inflammatory cytokines, reduced expression levels of CD80 and 
CD86, and decreased protein levels of antiapoptotic Bcl2 and phosphorylated 
NF-κB p65. RNA-seq analysis showed that Jh-X-119-01 had an impact on several 
pathophysiologic processes of BMDCs, including reduction of GVHD-related genes 
and regulation of helper T cell differentiation. Importantly, IRAK1 inhibition 
did not impair cytotoxic function of T cells or the allo-HCT-related GVL effect 
against A20 lymphoma cells. In addition, the IRAK1 inhibitor did not retard 
recovery of hematopoietic cells in blood or bone marrow. Our findings show that 
selective IRAK1 inhibition ameliorates murine aGVHD but preserves the GVL 
effect. Our findings may have implications for the use of an IRAK1 inhibitor in 
allo-HCT.","Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

(#)Contributed equally","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for the identification of 
new antiviral drug therapies for a variety of diseases. COVID-19 is caused by 
infection with the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, while other related human 
coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from severe respiratory infections to the 
common cold. We developed a computational approach to identify new antiviral 
drug targets and repurpose clinically-relevant drug compounds for the treatment 
of a range of human coronavirus diseases. Our approach is based on graph

intracellular binding of MyD88, followed by assembly of IL1-R Associated Kinases 
(IRAKs) into the so-called Myddosome. Using NMR, Nechama et al. determined the 
structure of the IRAK-M death domain monomer (PDBid: 5UKE). With this structure, 
they performed a docking study to model the location of IRAK-M in the Myddosome. 
Based on this, they present a molecular basis for selectivity of IRAK-M towards 
IRAK1 over IRAK2 binding. When we attempted to use 5UKE as a homology modeling 
template, we noticed that our 5UKE-based models had structural issues, such as 
disallowed torsion angles and solvent exposed tryptophans. We therefore analyzed 
the NMR ensemble of 5UKE using structure validation tools and we compared 5UKE 
with homologous high-resolution X-ray structures. We identified several 
structural anomalies in 5UKE, including packing issues, frayed helices and 
improbable side chain conformations. We used Yasara to build a homology model, 
based on two high resolution death domain crystal structures, as an alternative 
model for the IRAK-M death domain (atomic coordinates, modeling details and

study, we have performed exome sequencing and analysis of 51 Head and Neck

tumour suppressors, we have identified novel gene signatures differentiating 
buccal, alveolar, and tongue cancers. Around 50% of the patients showed mutation 
in tumour suppressor genes TP53 and TP63. Apart from the known mutations, we 
report novel mutations in the genes AKT1, SPECC1, and LRP1B, which are linked 
with tumour progression and patient survival. A highly curated process was 
developed to identify survival signatures. 36 survival-related genes were 
identified based on the correlation of functional impact of variants identified 
using exome-seq with gene expression from transcriptome data (GEPIA database) 
and survival. An independent LASSO regression analysis was also performed. 
Survival signatures common to both the methods led to identification of 4 dead

(#)Contributed equally","Osteoarthritis (OA), a highly prevalent chronic joint disease, involves a 
complex network of inflammatory mediators that not only triggers pain and 
cartilage degeneration but also accelerates disease progression. Traditional 
Chinese medicinal shenjinhuoxue mixture (SHM) shows anti-inflammatory and 
analgesic effects against OA with remarkable clinical efficacy. This study 
explored the mechanism underlying anti-OA properties of SHM and evaluated its 
efficacy and safety via in vivo experiments. Through network pharmacology and 
published literature, we identified the key active phytochemicals in SHM, 
including β-sitosterol, oleanolic acid, licochalcone A, quercetin, isorhamnetin, 
kaempferol, morusin, lupeol, and pinocembrin; the pivotal targets of which are 
TLR-4 and NF-κB, eliciting anti-OA activity. These phytochemicals can enter the 
active pockets of TLR-4 and NF-κB with docking score ≤ -3.86 kcal/mol, as shown 
in molecular docking models. By using surface plasmon resonance assay, 
licochalcone A and oleanolic acid were found to have good TLR-4-binding 
affinity. In OA rats, oral SHM at mid and high doses (8.72 g/kg and 26.2 g/kg) 
over 6 weeks significantly alleviated mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia (P < 
0.0001). Accordingly, the expression of inflammatory mediators (TLR-4, 
interleukin (IL-) 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), NF-κB-p65, tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF-) α, IL-6, and IL-1β), receptor activator of the NF-κB 
ligand (RANKL), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in the 
synovial and cartilage tissue of OA rats was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). 
Moreover, pathological observation illustrated amelioration of cartilage 
degeneration and joint injury. In chronic toxicity experiment of rats, SHM at 
60 mg/kg demonstrated the safety. SHM had an anti-inflammatory effect through a 
synergistic combination of active phytochemicals to attenuate pain and cartilage 
degeneration by inhibiting TLR-4 and NF-κB activation. This study provided the 
experimental foundation for the development of SHM into a more effective dosage

all efforts and advances in the treatment of sepsis, it is still considered one 
of the leading causes of death in hospitalized patients. Today, we have to use 
novel therapies and one of the most important is cell-free therapy. Exosomes 
have been shown to contain the contents of their parent cells and that they do 
not generate an immune response between different individuals which makes them a 
good candidate for transplantation. Unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC), also 
known as mesenchymal stem cell progenitors due to their high proliferative 
capacity and low immune response, may be a novel therapy for sepsis. In this 
study, the effect of USSC-derived exosomes on sepsis was investigated using a 
mouse model. USSCs were isolated from human cord blood and characterized by flow 
cytometry and multi-lineage differentiation. The exosomes were then harvested 
from USSCs and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Western 
blotting, and dynamic light scattering. The harvested exosomes were injected 
into the mouse model of sepsis. Biochemical, histological, molecular, and 
survival studies were performed in different groups. Our observations showed 
that USSC-derived exosomes can reduce inflammation in septic mice. 
Histopathologic and biochemical findings in the sham group showed multiorgan 
involvement, but these changes disappeared after 7 days of exosome 
administration. Moreover, the expression of IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 (main adapter 
molecules in signaling pathways of inflammation) was decreased through negative 
regulation by miR-146a after 72 h of exosome administration. A 2-fold increase 
in the level of IL-10 and a 2-fold decrease in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α was 
observed. In conclusion, we showed that direct injection of USSC-derived 
exosomes can be one of the important methods for the treatment of various 
aspects of sepsis due to their immunomodulatory properties.","© 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000520639

signaling pathways are a hallmark of development and progression of hematologic 
malignancies. The interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are a family 
of related signaling intermediates (IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK3, IRAK4) that operate at 
the nexus of multiple inflammatory pathways implicated in the hematologic 
malignancies. In this review, we explicate the oncogenic role of these kinases 
and review recent therapeutic advances in the dawning era of IRAK-targeted 
therapy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging evidence places IRAK signaling at the confluence of 
adaptive resistance and oncogenesis in the hematologic malignancies and solid 
tissue tumors. Preclinical investigations nominate the IRAK kinases as 
targetable molecular dependencies in diverse cancers.
SUMMARY: IRAK-targeted therapies that have matriculated to early phase trials 
are yielding promising preliminary results. However, studies of IRAK kinase 
signaling continue to defy conventional signaling models and raise questions as 
to the design of optimal treatment strategies. Efforts to refine IRAK signaling 
mechanisms in the malignant context will inspire deliberate IRAK-targeted drug 
development and informed combination therapy.","Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000693

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVES: In the premature newborn, perinatal inflammation mediated by 
microglia contributes significantly to neurodevelopmental injuries including 
white matter injury (WMI). Brain inflammation alters development through 
neuroinflammatory processes mediated by activation of homeostatic microglia 
toward a pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype. Investigating immune 
regulators of microglial activation is crucial to find effective strategies to 
prevent and treat WMI.
METHODS: Ex vivo microglial cultures and a mouse model of WMI induced by 
perinatal inflammation (interleukin-1-beta [IL-1β] and postnatal days 1-5) were 
used to uncover and elucidate the role of microRNA-146b-5p in microglial 
activation and WMI.
RESULTS: A specific reduction in vivo in microglia of Dicer, a protein required 
for microRNAs maturation, reduces pro-inflammatory activation of microglia and 
prevents hypomyelination in our model of WMI. Microglial miRNome analysis in the 
WMI model identified miRNA-146b-5p as a candidate modulator of microglial 
activation. Ex vivo microglial cell culture treated with the pro-inflammatory 
stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to overexpression of immunomodulatory 
miRNA-146b-5p but its drastic reduction in the microglial extracellular vesicles 
(EVs). To increase miRNA-146b-5p expression, we used a 3DNA nanocarrier to 
deliver synthetic miRNA-146b-5p specifically to microglia. Enhancing microglial 
miRNA-146b-5p overexpression significantly decreased LPS-induced activation, 
downregulated IRAK1, and restored miRNA-146b-5p levels in EVs. In our WMI model, 
3DNA miRNA-146b-5p treatment significantly prevented microglial activation, 
hypomyelination, and cognitive defect induced by perinatal inflammation.
INTERPRETATIONS: These findings support that miRNA-146b-5p is a major regulator 
of microglia phenotype and could be targeted to reduce the incidence and the 
severity of perinatal brain injuries and their long-term consequences. ANN

endothelial inflammation and dysfunction, which characterizes the early stages 
of atherosclerosis. The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 
3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been reported to contribute to the endothelial 
inflammatory response that promotes atherosclerosis development and progression. 
This study sought to investigate the effects of miR-146a-5p on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome injury and pro-inflammatory 
cytokine production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
METHODS: HUVECs were transfected with a miR-146a-5p mimic, small-interfering RNA 
(siRNA) (si-TRAF6, and si-IRAK1), and were then stimulated with LPS for 24 h. 
The messenger (mRNA) and the protein levels of p-NF-κB/NF-κB, NLRP3, Caspase-1, 
pro-inflammatory cytokine [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-α)] in the HUVECs were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reactions (PCRs) and western blot assays, respectively. The secretion of 
IL-6 from the cells was detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). 
Bioinformatic and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to identify the 
targets of miR-146a-5p.
RESULTS: LPS promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in a dose-dependent 
manner and significantly increased the expression levels of p-NF-κB/NF-κB p65, 
NLRP3, and Caspase-1. After transfection with a miR-146a-5p mimic, or si-TRAF6 
or si-IRAK1, we observed that the mRNA and protein levels of NF-κB/p-NF-κB, 
NLRP3, Caspase-1, and pro-inflammatory cytokine in the HUVECs were all 
down-regulated, and the secretion of IL-6 from cells declined significantly. 
After transfection with a miR-146-5p mimic, the expression of TRAF6 and IRAK1 in 
HUVECs were both down-regulated. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that 
miR-146-5p directly targets the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of TRAF6 and 
IRAK1 to regulate their expression.
CONCLUSIONS: As a modulator of TRAF6 and IRAK1, miR-146a-5p negatively regulated 
LPS-induced NF-κB activation and the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway in 
HUVECs. Thus, miRNA-146a-5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for

neurodegenerative diseases exhibit demyelination concomitantly with neurological 
deficit and cognitive impairment. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are 
present in the adult central nervous system (CNS), and they can proliferate, 
differentiate, and remyelinate axons after damage. However, remyelination 
therapies are not in clinical use. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major 
demyelinating disease in the CNS. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have 
demonstrated therapeutic promise in animal models and in clinical trials of MS. 
Exosomes are nanoparticles generated by nearly all cells and they mediate 
cell-cell communication by transferring cargo biomaterials. Here, we hypothesize 
that exosomes harvested from MSCs have a similar therapeutic effect on 
enhancement of remyelination as that of MSCs. In the present study we employed 
exosomes derived from rhesus monkey MSCs (MSC-Exo). Two mouse models of 
demyelination were employed: 1) experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 
an animal model of MS; and 2) cuprizone (CPZ) diet model, a toxic demyelination 
model. MSC-Exo or PBS were intravenously injected twice a week for 4 weeks, 
starting on day 10 post immunization in EAE mice, or once a week for 2 weeks 
starting on the day of CPZ diet withdrawal. Neurological and cognitive function 
were tested, OPC differentiation and remyelination, neuroinflammation and the 
potential underlying mechanisms were investigated using immunofluorescent 
staining, transmission electron microscopy and Western blot. Data generated from 
the EAE model revealed that MSC-Exo cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and 
target neural cells. Compared with the controls (p < 0.05), treatment with 
MSC-Exo: 1) significantly improved neurological outcome; 2) significantly 
increased the numbers of newly generated OLs (BrdU+/APC+) and mature OLs (APC+), 
and the level of myelin basic protein (MBP); 3) decreased amyloid-β precursor 
protein (APP)+ density; 4) decreased neuroinflammation by increasing the M2 
phenotype and decreasing the M1 phenotype of microglia, as well as their related 
cytokines; 5) inhibited the TLR2/IRAK1/NFκB pathway. Furthermore, we confirmed 
that the MSC-Exo treatment significantly improved cognitive function, promoted 
remyelination, increased polarization of M2 phenotype and blocked TLR2 signaling 
in the CPZ model. Collectively, MSC-Exo treatment promotes remyelination by both 
directly acting on OPCs and indirectly by acting on microglia in the 
demyelinating CNS. This study provides the cellular and molecular basis for this 
cell-free exosome therapy on remyelination and modulation of neuroinflammation 
in the CNS, with great potential for treatment of demyelinating and

degrading mRNAs encoding cytokines and inflammatory mediators in mammals. 
However, it is unclear how Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay is controlled in 
interleukin (IL)-1β- or Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-stimulated cells. Here, 
by analyzing the Regnase-1 interactome, we found that IL-1β or TLR stimulus 
dynamically induced the formation of Regnase-1-β-transducin repeat-containing 
protein (βTRCP) complex. Importantly, we also uncovered a novel interaction 
between Regnase-1 and 14-3-3 in both mouse and human cells. In 
IL-1R/TLR-stimulated cells, the Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction is mediated by 
IRAK1 through a previously uncharacterized C-terminal structural domain. 
Phosphorylation of Regnase-1 at S494 and S513 is critical for Regnase-1-14-3-3 
interaction, while a different set of phosphorylation sites of Regnase-1 is 
known to be required for the recognition by βTRCP and proteasome-mediated 
degradation. We found that Regnase-1-14-3-3 and Regnase-1-βTRCP interactions are 
not sequential events. Rather, 14-3-3 protects Regnase-1 from βTRCP-mediated 
degradation. On the other hand, 14-3-3 abolishes Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay 
by inhibiting Regnase-1-mRNA association. In addition, nuclear-cytoplasmic 
shuttling of Regnase-1 is abrogated by 14-3-3 interaction. Taken together, the 
results suggest that a novel inflammation-induced interaction of 14-3-3 with 
Regnase-1 stabilizes inflammatory mRNAs by sequestering Regnase-1 in the 
cytoplasm to prevent mRNA recognition.","© 2021, Akaki et al.","DOI: 10.7554/eLife.71966

nature and have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
anticancerous activities. However, the molecular mechanisms/signaling by which 
these molecules exert their effect are still not fully understood. In this 
study, a group of quinone-derived compounds were examined for their potential 
inhibitory effect against human IRAK1 and IRAK4 kinases in vitro. We have 
identified five compounds: 1,4-naphthoquinone, emodin, shikonin, plumbagin, and 
menadione (vitamin K3) as active and selective inhibitors of human IRAK1 enzyme 
in vitro. The biochemical binding and molecular interactions between the active 
compounds and IRAK1's catalytic site were demonstrated in silico using 
structural-based docking and dynamic simulation analysis. Also, 
1,4-naphthoquinone was found to effectively inhibit the growth of cancer cell 
lines overexpressing IRAK1. Furthermore, 1,4-naphthoquinone potently suppressed 
the production and secretion of key proinflammatory cytokine proteins IL-8, 
IL-1β, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated PMA-induced human THP-1

receptor (TLR) signaling pathway in the pathogenesis and therapeutic regimens of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, a prognostic TLR-based gene signature 
was conducted for HCC. Methods: HCC-specific TLRs were screened in the TCGA 
cohort. A LASSO model was constructed based on prognosis-related HCC-specific 
TLRs. The predictive efficacy, sensitivity, and independency of this signature 
was then evaluated and externally verified in the ICGC, GSE14520, and GSE76427 
cohorts. The associations between this signature and tumor microenvironment 
(stromal/immune score, immune checkpoint expression, and immune cell 
infiltrations) and chemotherapy response were assessed in HCC specimens. The 
expression of TLRs in this signature was verified in HCC and normal liver 
tissues by Western blot. Following si-MAP2K2 transfection, colony formation and 
apoptosis of Huh7 and HepG2 cells were examined. Results: Herein, we identified 
60 HCC-specific TLRs. A TLR-based gene signature (MAP2K2, IRAK1, RAC1, TRAF3, 
MAP3K7, and SPP1) was conducted for HCC prognosis. High-risk patients exhibited 
undesirable outcomes. ROC curves confirmed the well prediction performance of 
this signature. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the 
signature was an independent prognostic indicator. Also, high-risk HCC was 
characterized by an increased immune score, immune checkpoint expression, and 
immune cell infiltration. Meanwhile, high-risk patients displayed higher 
sensitivity to gemcitabine and cisplatin. The dysregulation of TLRs in the 
signature was confirmed in HCC. MAP2K2 knockdown weakened colony formation and 
elevated apoptosis of Huh7 and HepG2 cells. Conclusion: Collectively, this 
TLR-based gene signature might assist clinicians to select personalized therapy 
programs for HCC patients.","Copyright © 2021 Liu, Liu, Yu, Zhang, Shi and Liang.","DOI: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.729789

metastasis. Some previous studies have indicated CXCR4 as a therapeutic target 
in cancer. CXCR4 is known as a direct target of miR-146a. The present study 
aimed to investigate how exogenous induction of miR-146a affects CXCR4 gene and 
protein expression and also proliferation, apoptosis and migration of CRC cells. 
Transfection of Caco-2 and SW480 cells by a synthetic miR-146a mimic led to 
downregulation of CXCR4 expression at both gene and protein levels. It also 
downregulated expression of several miR-146a targets, including GSK3B, IRAK1, 
TRAF6, AKT2, SMAD4, EGFR and NFKB1, mostly in SW480 cells. Overexpression of 
miR-146a resulted in a partial cell cycle arrest in the both cell lines, while 
the apoptotic rate was also decreased. In regards to epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition factors, VIM was downregulated in the both cell lines, but SNAI1 was 
upregulated in Caco-2 cells. The wound closure assay showed a reduction in cell 
migration in SW480 cells, but an opposite effect was detected in Caco-2 cells 
following transfection with miR-146a mimic. Therefore, our results are 
indicating that overexpression of miR-146a, despite downregulation of oncogenic 
CXCR4, may not lead to a universal tumor suppressive effect in all CRC cells, 
and this is possibly due to differences in miR-146a effects on signaling 
pathways in each cell type. Selection of miR-146a for tumor suppression requires 
enough details regarding the signaling profile of cancer cells otherwise it may 
produce unexpected outcome.",Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.tice.2021.101654

modifications regulating physiological and pathological processes. MAPK

show that the lack of MKP-1 modulates the landscape of ubiquitin ligases and 
deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs). MKP-1-/- showed an aberrant regulation of several 
DUBs and increased expression of proteins and genes involved in IL-1/TLR

of A20. Among abundant DUBs, ubiquitin-specific protease-13 (USP13), which 
cleaves polyubiquitin-chains on client proteins, was substantially enhanced in 
murine MKP-1-deficient BMDMs. An inhibitor of USP13 decreased the K63 
polyubiquitination on TRAF6, TAK1 phosphorylation, IL-1β, and TNF-α induction in

(CRC), we have created a new microRNA (miRNA) expression signature based on 
RNA-sequencing. Analysis of the signature showed that 84 miRNAs were 
upregulated, and 70 were downregulated in CRC tissues. Interestingly, our 
signature indicated that both guide and passenger strands of some miRNAs were 
significantly dysregulated in CRC tissues. These findings support our earlier 
data demonstrating the involvement of miRNA passenger strands in cancer 
pathogenesis. Our study focused on downregulated miR-490-3p and investigated its 
tumor-suppressive function in CRC cells. We successfully identified a total of 
38 putative oncogenic targets regulated by miR-490-3p in CRC cells. Among these 
targets, the expression of three genes (IRAK1: p = 0.0427, FUT1: p = 0.0468, and 
GPRIN2: p = 0.0080) significantly predicted 5-year overall survival of CRC 
patients. Moreover, we analyzed the direct regulation of IRAK1 by miR-490-3p, 
and its resultant oncogenic function in CRC cells. Thus, we have clarified a 
part of the molecular pathway of CRC based on the action of tumor-suppressive 
miR-490-3p. This new miRNA expression signature of CRC will be a useful tool for 
elucidating new molecular pathogenesis in this disease.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms22189876

is a major inhibitor of Toll-like receptor signaling. Our laboratory identified 
a novel SIGIRR stop mutation (p.Y168X) in an infant who died of severe 
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Herein, we investigated the mechanisms by which 
SIGIRR mutations induce Toll-like receptor hyper-responsiveness in the neonatal 
gut, disrupting postnatal intestinal adaptation.
METHODS: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 
was used to generate transgenic mice encoding the SIGIRR p.Y168X mutation. Ileal 
lysates, mouse intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lysates, and intestinal sections 
were used to assess inflammation, signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, microRNA (miRNA), and 
interleukin-1-related-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression. Western blot, 
quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR), and 
luciferase assays were performed to investigate SIGIRR-STAT3 signaling in human 
intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC) expressing wild-type or SIGIRR (p.Y168X) 
plasmids.
RESULTS: SigirrTg mice showed increased intestinal inflammation and nuclear 
factor-κB activation concomitant with decreased IEC expression of miR-146a and 
miR-155. Mechanistic studies in HIECs showed that although SIGIRR induced 
STAT3-mediated expression of miR-146a and miR-155, the p.Y168X mutation 
disrupted SIGIRR-mediated STAT3-dependent miRNA expression. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays showed that SIGIRR activation of 
STAT3-induced miRNA expression is dependent on IRAK1. Both in HIECs and in the 
mouse intestine, decreased expression of miR-146a observed with the p.Y168X 
mutation increased expression of IRAK1, a protein whose down-regulation is 
important for postnatal gut adaptation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results uncover a novel pathway (SIGIRR-STAT3-miRNA-IRAK1 
repression) by which SIGIRR regulates postnatal intestine adaptation, which is 
disrupted by a SIGIRR mutation identified in human NEC. These data provide new 
insights into how human genetic mutations in SIGIRR identified in NEC result in 
loss of postnatal intestinal immune tolerance.",Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jcmgh.2021.09.009

reported a truncated GATA4 protein lacking C-terminus induced by p.S335X 
mutation in cardiomyocyte from ventricular septal defect (VSD) patients. 
However, it is still unclear whether GATA4 p.S335X mutation could influence the

clinical manifestations in genetically susceptible individuals with an 
insufficient or balanced Th1 immune response to eliminate the parasite. MiRNAs 
play important regulatory role in numerous biological processes including 
essential cellular functions. miR146-a acts as an inhibitor of interleukin 1 
receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 
associated factor 6 (TRAF6) present in the toll-like receptors pathway while 
miR499a modulates TGF-β and TNF signalling pathways. Here, we investigated 
whether MIRNA146A rs2910164 and MIRNA499 rs3746444 variants are associated with 
the development of L. guyanensis (Lg)-cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The variants 
MIR146A rs2910164 and MIR499A rs3746444 were assessed in 850 patients with Lg-CL 
and 891 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment 
length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Plasma cytokines were measured using the BioPlex 
assay. Carriers of rs2910164 CC genotype have 30% higher odds of developing CL 
(ORadjage/sex = 1.3 [95%CI 0.9-1.8]; Padjage/sex 0.14) compared to individuals 
with the genotype GG (ORadjage/sex = 0.77 [95%CI 0.56-1.0]; Padjage/sex 0.14) if 
exposed to Lg-infection. Heterozygous GC individuals also showed lower odds of 
developing CL (ORadjage/sex = 0.77 [95%CI 0.5-1.1]; Padjage/sex 0.09). 
Homozygosity for the allele C is suggestive of an association with the 
development of Lg-CL among exposed individuals to Lg-infection. However, the 
odds of developing CL associated with the CC genotype was evident only in male 
individuals (ORadjage = 1.3 [95% CI = 0.9-2.0]; Padjage = 0.06). Individuals 
homozygous for the G allele tend to have higher plasma IL-8 and CCL5. Similarly, 
for the MIR499A rs3746444, an association with the G allele was only observed 
among male individuals (OR = 1.4 [1.0-1.9]; P = 0.009). In a dominant model, 
individuals with the G allele (GG-GA) when compared to the AA genotype reveals 
that carriers of the G allele have 40% elevated odds of developing Lg-CL 
(ORadjage = 1.4 [1.1-1.9]). Individuals with the GG genotype have higher odds of 
developing Lg-CL (ORadjage/sex = 2.0 [95%CI 0.83-5.0]; Padjage = 0.01. 
Individuals homozygous for the G allele have higher plasma IL-8. Genetic 
combinations of both variants revealed that male individuals exposed to Lg 
bearing three or four susceptible alleles have higher odds of developing Lg-CL 
(OR = 2.3 [95% CI 1.0-4.7]; p = 0.017). Both MIR146A rs2910164 and MIR499A 
rs3746444 are associated with the development of Lg-CL and this association is

loci of IRAK1 gene (rs1059702, rs7061789, rs1059703, and rs3027898) were 
genotyped using multiplex SNaPshot technique in 102 NMOSD patients and 213 
healthy subjects. Allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies were compared. 
Stratified analyses were conducted by age, sex, AQP4 status, and age of onset. 
IRAK1 mRNA levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 30 NMOSD patients 
(of active phase) and 15 healthy control subjects were detected using qPCR. The 
correlations between the SNP polymorphisms and mRNA expression levels of genes 
were tested using non-parametric tests. Results: The minor allele frequencies 
(MAF) of these four locis were significantly lower in NMOSD cases than that of 
the controls. The frequencies of rs1059703G/G genotype, rs1059702A/A genotype, 
rs3027898 C/C genotype, and rs7061789G/G genotype were higher in the case group 
than that of the control group. Haplotype analysis revealed that the major 
haplotype ""G-A-C-G"" (alleles in the order of SNPs rs1059703, rs1059702, 
rs3027898, and rs7061789), containing the risk alleles, conferred an adverse 
effect on NMOSD. The level of IRAK1mRNA was markedly higher in NMOSD when 
compared to the healthy control groups. The IRAK1mRNA levels of female patients 
with the major haplotype were significantly higher compared to those with other 
haplotypes and to the male patients with the same genotype. Conclusion: IRAK1 
polymorphisms were highly correlated with NMOSD susceptibility. Its haplotype 
G-A-C-G (rs1059703-rs1059702-rs3027898-rs7061789) confers increasing the risk of 
NMOSD in female patients. The IRAK1 risk haplotype G-A-C-G upregulated IRAK1 
mRNA expression in female NMOSD patients. Our study provides a novel insight 
into the molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis of NMOSD and reveals that IRAK1 
is the potential mechanism-specific druggable target in NMOSD disease.","Copyright © 2021 Yan, Guo, Chen, Xi, Wang, Ma and Li.","DOI: 10.3389/fneur.2021.661791

advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) in the pathophysiology of various acute 
and chronic inflammatory diseases, continuous efforts have been made to discover 
novel therapeutic inhibitors of TLRs and RAGE to treat inflammatory disorders. A 
recent study by our group has demonstrated that trimebutine, a spasmolytic drug, 
suppresses the high mobility group box 1‒RAGE signaling that is associated with 
triggering proinflammatory signaling pathways in macrophages. Our present work 
showed that trimebutine suppresses interleukin-6 (IL-6) production in 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a stimulant of TLR4)-stimulated macrophages of 
RAGE-knockout mice. In addition, trimebutine suppresses the LPS-induced 
production of various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mouse 
macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells. Importantly, trimebutine suppresses IL-6 
production induced by TLR2-and TLR7/8/9 stimulants. Furthermore, trimebutine 
greatly reduces mortality in a mouse model of LPS-induced sepsis. Studies 
exploring the action mechanism of trimebutine revealed that it inhibits the 
LPS-induced activation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and the 
subsequent activations of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). These findings 
suggest that trimebutine exerts anti-inflammatory effects on TLR signaling by 
downregulating IRAK1‒ERK1/2‒JNK pathway and NF-κB activity, thereby indicating 
the therapeutic potential of trimebutine in inflammatory diseases. Therefore, 
trimebutine can be a novel anti-inflammatory drug-repositioning candidate and 
may provide an important scaffold for designing more effective dual 
anti-inflammatory drugs that target TLR/RAGE signaling.",Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.abb.2021.109029

following parturition. It is clear that genetic factors are involved in the 
etiology of endometritis, however, the molecular pathogenesis of endometritis is 
not entirely understood. In this study, a system biology approach was used to 
better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of 
endometritis. Forty transcriptomic datasets comprising of 20 RNA-Seq (GSE66825) 
and 20 miRNA-Seq (GSE66826) were obtained from the GEO database. Next, the 
co-expressed modules were constructed based on RNA-Seq (Rb-modules) and 
miRNA-Seq (mb-modules) data, separately, using a weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) approach. Preservation analysis was used to find the 
non-preserved Rb-modules in endometritis samples. Afterward, the non-preserved 
Rb-modules were assigned to the mb-modules to construct the integrated 
regulatory networks. Just highly connected genes (hubs) in the networks were 
considered and functional enrichment analysis was used to identify the 
biological pathways associated with the development of the disease. Furthermore, 
additional bioinformatic analysis including protein-protein interactions network 
and miRNA target prediction were applied to enhance the reliability of the 
results. Thirty-five Rb-modules and 10 mb-modules were identified and 19 and 10 
modules were non-preserved, respectively, which were enriched in biological 
pathways related to endometritis like inflammation and ciliogenesis. Two 
non-preserved Rb-modules were significantly assigned to three mb-modules and 
three and two important sub-networks in the Rb-modules were identified, 
respectively, including important mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs genes like IRAK1,

cause a series of diseases. In this study, to investigate the immunosuppressive 
mechanisms in fish, tilapia were intrapleural injected cyclophosphamide (CTX) at 
the doses of 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg·kg-1 to induce immunosuppression. We 
determined the viability of immune cells, the content of lysozyme (LZM) and 
immunoglobulin M (IgM), the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and antioxidant 
parameters. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of complement C3 (c3), igm and the genes 
associated with the TLR-NF-κB signaling pathway in the head kidney (HK) and 
spleen were also determined. The results showed that CTX had a significant 
cytotoxic effect on peripheral blood leukocytes, HK macrophages and spleen cells 
in a dose-dependent manner. The protein and mRNA levels of C3 and IgM were 
down-regulated with the increase of CTX concentrations in serum, HK and/or 
spleen. The NO and LZM contents decreased significantly in HK and spleen after 
CTX treatments with 75 and 100 mg·kg-1. CTX treatments with 50, 75 and/or 100 
mg·kg-1 markedly decreased the antioxidant ability and enhanced lipid 
peroxidation in HK and spleen. Furthermore, qPCR data showed that CTX treatments 
with 50-100 mg·kg-1 clearly down-regulated the mRNA levels of tlr2, myd88, 
irak1, traf6, nfκb1, nfκb2, il-6, il-10 and tnf-α in the HK and/or spleen.

massive cytokine production, cellular triggers of this process and strategies to 
target them remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain 
(NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein substantially induces multiple 
inflammatory molecules in myeloid cells and human PBMCs. Using a combination of 
phenotypic screening with machine learning-based modeling, we identified and 
experimentally validated several protein kinases, including JAK1, EPHA7, IRAK1, 
MAPK12, and MAP3K8, as essential downstream mediators of NTD-induced cytokine 
production, implicating the role of multiple signaling pathways in cytokine 
release. Further, we found several FDA-approved drugs, including ponatinib, and 
cobimetinib as potent inhibitors of the NTD-mediated cytokine release. Treatment 
with ponatinib outperforms other drugs, including dexamethasone and baricitinib, 
inhibiting all cytokines in response to the NTD from SARS-CoV-2 and emerging 
variants. Finally, ponatinib treatment inhibits lipopolysaccharide-mediated 
cytokine release in myeloid cells in vitro and lung inflammation mouse model. 
Together, we propose that agents targeting multiple kinases required for 
SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release, such as ponatinib, may represent an 
attractive therapeutic option for treating moderate to severe COVID-19.",©2021 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.,"DOI: 10.15252/msb.202110426

factors have been identified that regulate transplant immunopathology by 
modulating the function of DCs. Among these, microRNAs (miRNAs), small 
non-coding RNA molecules, have received much attention. The miRNA miR-223 is 
very highly expressed and tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells. It plays an 
important role in modulating the immune response by regulating neutrophils and 
macrophages, and its dysregulation contributes to multiple types of immune 
diseases. However, the role of miR-223 in immune rejection is unclear. Here, we 
observed expression of miR-223 in patients and mice who had undergone heart 
transplantation and found that it increased in the serum of both, and also in 
DCs from the spleens of recipient mice, although it was unchanged in splenic T 
cells. We also found that miR-223 expression decreased in 
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated DCs. Increasing the level of miR-223 in DCs 
promoted polarization of DCs toward a tolerogenic phenotype, which indicates 
that miR-223 can attenuate activation and maturation of DCs. MiR-223 effectively 
induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) by inhibiting the function of 
antigen-presenting DCs. In addition, we identified Irak1 as a miR-223 target 
gene and an essential regulator of DC maturation. In mouse allogeneic 
heterotopic heart transplantation models, grafts survived longer and suffered 
less immune cell infiltration in mice with miR-223-overexpressing immature 
(im)DCs. In the miR-223-overexpressing imDC recipients, T cells from spleen 
differentiated into Tregs, and the level of IL-10 in heart grafts was markedly 
higher than that in the control group. In conclusion, miR-223 regulates the 
function of DCs via Irak1, differentiation of T cells into Tregs, and secretion 
of IL-10, thereby suppressing allogeneic heart graft rejection.","Copyright © 2021 Yuan, Chen, Zhang, Wang, Hu, Ruan, Ren and Shi.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.676337

peri-implantitis in diabetic patients remains unclear. We hypothesized that 
glycemic fluctuation has greater adverse effect on experimental 
peri-implantitis, compared with sustained high blood glucose in diabetes.
RESULTS: Maxillary left first and second molars of diabetic db/db mice were 
extracted and were replaced with one dental implant in the healed edentulous 
space. Glycemic control or fluctuation were managed by constant or interrupted 
oral administration of rosiglitazone to these mice. Meanwhile, experimental 
peri-implantitis was induced by ligation around implants. After 14 weeks, 
inflammatory responses, and peri-implant bone loss, together with oral 
microbiota profile were analyzed. Diabetic mice with glycemic fluctuation showed 
greater peri-implant bone loss, inflammatory cell infiltration, and 
osteoclastogenesis, compared with mice with sustained hyperglycemia. Compared to 
sustained hyperglycemia, glycemic fluctuation led to further increase in IL-1β, 
TNFα, RANKL, TLR2/4, IRAK1, and TRAF6 mRNA expression in peri-implant gingival 
tissues. Both rosiglitazone-induced glycemic control and glycemic fluctuation 
caused microbiota profile change in diabetic mice compared to that in 
uncontrolled hyperglycemic mice.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that glycemic fluctuation may aggravate 
peri-implantitis inflammation and bone loss, which may be associated with a 
shift in peri-implant microbial profile towards dysbiotic changes and the 
activation of TLR2/4-IRAK1-TRAF6 signaling.",© 2021. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40729-021-00360-9

osteoarthritis (OA) progression, but the molecular mechanism for that protective 
affect remains unclear.
METHODS: Here, OA model rats were intraperitoneally injected with quercetin, and 
the severity of cartilage damage in the rats was evaluated by H&E, Safranin O, 
and Toluidine blue, as well as by using the Osteoarthritis Research Society 
International (OARSI) Scoring System. Additionally, rat chondrocytes were 
treated with quercetin and then stimulated with IL-1β. The levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α) were detected by ELISA.Cell 
apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry and Hoechst staining. ROS levels were 
measured using a DCFH-DA probe. Protein expression was evaluated by Western 
blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Our data showed that quercetin attenuated the degeneration and erosion 
of articular cartilage, suppressed inflammation and apoptosis, and downregulated 
the levels of IRAK1, NLRP3, and caspase-3 expression. In vitro data showed that 
overexpression of NLRP3 could reverse the suppressive effect of quercetin on 
IL-1β-induced rat chondrocyte injuries. Importantly, rescue experiments 
confirmed that quercetin inhibited IL-1β-induced rat chondrocyte injuries in 
vitro by suppressing the IRAK1/NLRP3 signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that quercetin inhibits IL-1β-induced 
inflammation and cartilage degradation by suppressing the IRAK1/NLRP3 signaling 
pathway.",© 2021 Li et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/JIR.S311924

mutations in the activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC 
DLBCL). The published literature suggests that interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1) is an essential gene for ABC DLBCL harboring MyD88 mutation. 
Importantly, the scaffolding function of IRAK1, rather than its kinase activity, 
is required for tumor cell survival. Herein, we present our design, synthesis, 
and biological evaluation of a novel series of potent and selective IRAK1 
degraders. One of the most potent compounds, Degrader-3 (JNJ-1013), effectively 
degraded cellular IRAK1 protein with a DC50 of 3 nM in HBL-1 cells. Furthermore, 
JNJ-1013 potently inhibited IRAK1 downstream signaling pathways and demonstrated 
strong anti-proliferative effects in ABC DLBCL cells with MyD88 mutation. This

susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). In this study, 14 polymorphisms 
in 12 key genes involved in the immune response (VDR, MR1, TLR1, TLR2, TLR10, 
SLC11A1, IL1B, IL10, IFNG, TNF, IRAK1, and FOXP3) were tested for their 
association with pulmonary TB in 271 patients with TB and 251 community-matched 
controls from the Republic of Moldova. In addition, gene-gene interactions 
involved in TB susceptibility were analyzed for a total of 43 genetic loci. 
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed a nominal association 
between TNF rs1800629 and pulmonary TB (Fisher exact test P = 0.01843). In the 
pairwise interaction analysis, the combination of the genotypes TLR6 rs5743810 
GA and TLR10 rs11096957 GT was significantly associated with an increased 
genetic risk of pulmonary TB (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.62-3.85; Fisher exact test P 
value = 1.5 × 10-5, significant after Bonferroni correction). In conclusion, the 
TLR6 rs5743810 and TLR10 rs11096957 two-locus interaction confers a 
significantly higher risk for pulmonary TB; due to its high frequency in the

more than 200 bases, is involved in various biological functions, including the 
immune process, stress process, and cell development process. However, the 
function of lncRNA in abalone, especially in immunity, has been rarely studied. 
H. discus hannai and H. diversicolor are two main aquaculture abalone, and their 
growth is easily affected by the main pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Through 
rigorous screening procedures for transcripts in this study, we found that 
lncRNAs were 34,240, 23,022 in Haliotis diversicolor and H. discus hannai 
injected with V. parahaemolyticus, respectively. We also identified the unique 
and common lncRNAs and mRNAs of two abalone species for the first time; the 
shared lncRNAs and mRNAs in Haliotis diversicolor and H. discus hannai were 2352 
and 13,165, respectively. Then gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed 
target genes of common and unique lncRNAs has shown that common lncRNAs could be 
widely involved in the biological processes of stress and cell development in 
both abalone species. In contrast, unique lncRNAs are linked to the Toll-like 
receptor, NF-kappaB signaling pathway of H. diversicolor, and pattern 
recognition receptors and lectins immune-related pathways of H. discus hannai. 
The co-expression network shows that some immune-related genes, such as INFK1, 
INFK2, CASP2, CASP8, IRAK1, lectin C, were closely related to lncRNAs. Further, 
we identified the targeted relationship between some immune-related genes and 
lncRNAs by qRT-PCR, through which we showed that the expression trend between 
targeted genes, such as INFK1 and Lnc7057, lectin C and Lnc6943, Lnc5637, and 
PLCG1 and Lnc1692, were consistent. In general, our results showed that lncRNA

etiopathology. We aimed to evaluate the genetic profile of TLR pathway-related 
key genes; the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MYD88), IL1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), the nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NFKB1), and 
interleukin 6 (IL6) in the blood of neonates with sepsis at the time of 
admission and post-treatment for the available paired-samples. This case-control 
study included 124 infants with sepsis admitted to the neonatal intensive care 
unit and 17 controls. The relative gene expressions were quantified by TaqMan 
Real-Time qPCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. MYD88, NFKB1, and 
IL6 relative expressions were significantly higher in sepsis cases than 
controls. Higher levels of MYD88 and IL6 were found in male neonates and 
contributed to the sex-based separation of the cases by the principal component 
analysis. ROC analysis revealed MYD88 and NFKB1 transcripts to be good 
biomarkers for sepsis. Furthermore, patients with high circulatory MYD88 levels 
were associated with poor survival, as revealed by Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. 
MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 transcripts showed association with different poor-outcome 
manifestations. Clustering analysis split the patient cohort into three distinct 
groups according to their transcriptomic signature and CRP levels. In 
conclusion, the study TLR pathway-related transcripts have a gender-specific 
signature, diagnostic, and prognostic clinical utility in neonatal sepsis.","DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-92912-7

activity has been linked to inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases, 
while ABIN1 could attenuate NF-κB activation to maintain immune homeostasis by 
utilizing UBAN to recognize linear (M1)-linked polyubiquitinated NF-κB 
activation mediators, including NEMO, IRAK1 and RIP1. PolyUb-mediated UBAN 
recruitment remains undetermined, since the recognition studies focused mostly 
on di-ubiquitin (diUb). Here we report three crystal structures of human ABIN1 
UBAN (hABIN1UBAN) in complex with M1-linked diUb, triUb, and tetraUb, 
respectively. Notably, the hABIN1UBAN:diUb structure reveals that a diUb 
randomly binds one of the Ub-binding sites of the hABIN1UBAN dimer and leaves 
the other site vacant. Together with the ITC and gel-filtration analyses, we 
found that M1-triUb and M1-tetraUb adopt two unique conformations, instead of an 
elongated one, and they preferentially use the N-terminal two-Ub unit to bind 
the primary Ub-binding site of a hABIN1UBAN dimer and the C-terminal two-Ub unit 
to bind the secondary Ub-binding site of another hABIN1UBAN dimer. Especially, 
our results suggest that two ABIN1UBAN dimers cooperatively bind two 
UBAN-binding units of a tetraUb or vice versa. Since the UBAN family members 
share a conserved diUb-binding mode, our results suggest that M1-polyUb 
modification allows multiple copies of the two-tandem Ub unit to simultaneously 
coordinate multiple and/or different binding partners to increase their local 
concentrations and to facilitate the formation of a large signaling complex. Our 
study provides a structural-functional glimpse of M1-polyUb as a 
multiple-molecule binding platform to exert its intrinsic structural plasticity

granules that allow the cells to survive. Stress granules are also central to 
cellular responses to infections, in which they can act as platforms for viral 
sensing or modulate innate immune signaling through pattern recognition 
receptors. However, the effect of innate immune signaling on stress granules is 
poorly understood. In this study, we report that prior induction of innate 
immune signaling through TLRs inhibited stress granule assembly in a TLR ligand 
dose-dependent manner in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Time course 
analysis suggests that TLR stimulation can reverse stress granule assembly even 
after it has begun. Additionally, both MYD88- and TRIF-mediated TLR signaling 
inhibited stress granule assembly in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress in 
bone marrow-derived macrophages and the chemotherapeutic drug oxaliplatin in 
murine B16 melanoma cells. This inhibition was not due to a decrease in 
expression of the critical stress granule proteins G3BP1 and DDX3X and was 
independent of IRAK1/4, JNK, ERK and P38 kinase activity but dependent on IKK 
complex kinase activity. Overall, we have identified the TLR-IKK complex

the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. SWI/SNF complex genes are 
genetically altered in over 20% of human malignancies, but the aberrant 
regulation of the SWI/SNF subunit genes and subsequent dysfunction caused by 
abnormal expression of subunit gene in cancer, remain poorly understood. Among 
the SWI/SNF subunit genes, SMARCA4, SMARCC1, and SMARCA2 were identified to be 
overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Modulation of SMARCA4, 
SMARCC1, and SMARCA2 inhibited in vitro tumorigenesis of HCC cells. However, 
SMARCA4-targeting elicited remarkable inhibition in an in vivo Ras-transgenic 
mouse HCC model (Ras-Tg), and high expression levels of SMARCA4 significantly 
associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, most HCC patients 
(72-86%) showed SMARCA4 overexpression compared to healthy controls. To identify 
SMARCA4-specific active enhancers, mapping, and analysis of chromatin state in 
liver cancer cells were performed. Integrative analysis of SMARCA4-regulated 
genes and active chromatin enhancers suggested 37 genes that are strongly 
activated by SMARCA4 in HCC. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and 
luciferase assays, we demonstrated that SMARCA4 activates Interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression through IRAK1 active enhancer in 
HCC. We then showed that transcriptional activation of IRAK1 induces oncoprotein 
Gankyrin and aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) in HCC. The 
regulatory mechanism of the SMARCA4-IRAK1-Gankyrin, AKR1B10 axis was further 
demonstrated in HCC cells and in vivo Ras-Tg mice. Our results suggest that 
aberrant overexpression of SMARCA4 causes SWI/SNF to promote IRAK1 enhancer to 
activate oncoprotein Gankyrin and AKR1B10, thereby contributing to 
hepatocarcinogenesis.","© 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41388-021-01875-6

electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based cellular endogenous IRAK1 activation assay 
as the most proximal functional evaluation of IRAK4 engagement to support 
structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Since IRAK1 activation is 
dependent on both the IRAK4 scaffolding function in Myddosome formation and 
IRAK4 kinase activity for signal transduction, this assay potentially captures 
inhibitors with different mechanisms of action. Data from this IRAK1 assay with 
compounds representing different structural classes showed statistically 
significant correlations when compared with results from both IRAK4 biochemical 
kinase activity and functional peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived 
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) secretion assays, validating the biological 
relevancy of the IRAK1 target engagement as a biomarker of the IRAK4 activity. 
Plate uniformity and potency reproducibility evaluations demonstrated that this 
assay is amenable to high throughput. Using Bland-Altman assay agreement 
analysis, we demonstrated that incorporating such proximal pharmacological 
assessment of cellular target engagement to an in vitro screening funnel for SAR 
studies can prevent compound optimization toward off-target activity.","DOI: 10.1177/24725552211021074

venous thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity associated with the presence of 
""anti-phospholipid antibodies."" Thrombosis may be the result of a 
hypercoagulable state related to activation of endothelial cells and platelets 
by anti-β2-glycoprotein I (β2-GPI) antibodies. Anti-β2-GPI antibodies induce a 
proinflammatory and procoagulant phenotype in these cells that, after 
activation, express tissue factor (TF), the major initiator of the clotting 
cascade, playing a role in thrombotic manifestations. Moreover, TF expression 
may also be induced by heparanase, an endo-β-D-glucuronidase, that generates 
heparan sulfate fragments, regulating inflammatory responses.
OBJECTIVES: In this study we analyzed, in human platelets and endothelial cells, 
the effect of a new symmetrical 2-aminophenyl-benzazolyl-5-acetate derivative 
(RDS3337), able to inhibit heparanase activity, on signal transduction pathways 
leading to TF expression triggered by anti-β2-GPI.
METHODS: Platelets and endothelial cells were incubated with affinity purified 
anti-β2-GPI after pretreatment with RDS3337. Cell lysates were analyzed for 
phospho-interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), phospho-p65 nuclear 
factor kappa B (NF-κB) and TF by western blot. In addition, platelet activation 
and secretion by ATP release dosage were evaluated.
RESULTS: IRAK phosphorylation and consequent NF-κB activation, as well as TF 
expression triggered by anti-β2-GPI treatment were significantly prevented by 
previous pretreatment with RDS3337. In the same vein, pretreatment with RDS3337 
prevented platelet aggregation and ATP release triggered by anti-β2-GPI 
antibodies.
CONCLUSION: These findings support the view of heparanase involvement in a 
prothrombotic state related to APS syndrome, suggesting a novel target to 
regulate overexpression of procoagulant protein(s).",© 2021 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.,"DOI: 10.1111/jth.15417

(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and 
Research Mohali, Mohali, Manauli, Punjab, India.","Salmonella enterica Typhimurium is a rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium that 
mostly enters the human body through contaminated food. It causes a 
gastrointestinal disorder called salmonellosis in humans and typhoid-like 
systemic disease in mice. OmpV, an outer membrane protein of S. Typhimurium, 
helps in adhesion and invasion of bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells and 
thus plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium. In this study, we 
have shown that intraperitoneal immunization with OmpV is able to induce high 
IgG production and protection against systemic disease. Further, oral 
immunization with OmpV-incorporated proteoliposome (OmpV-proteoliposome [PL]) 
induces production of high IgA antibody levels and protection against 
gastrointestinal infection. Furthermore, we have shown that OmpV induces Th1 
bias in systemic immunization with purified OmpV, but both Th1 and Th2 
polarization in oral immunization with OmpV-proteoliposome (PL). Additionally, 
we have shown that OmpV activates innate immune cells, such as monocytes, 
macrophages, and intestinal epithelial cells, in a Toll-like receptor 2 
(TLR2)-dependent manner. Interestingly, OmpV is recognized by the TLR1/2 
heterodimer in monocytes, but by both TLR1/2 and TLR2/6 heterodimers in 
macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells. Further, downstream signaling 
involves MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1, 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (both p38 and Jun N-terminal protein 
kinase (JNK)), and transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. Due to its ability to 
efficiently activate both the innate and adaptive immune systems and protective 
efficacy, OmpV can be a potential vaccine candidate against S. Typhimurium 
infection. Further, the fact that OmpV can be recognized by both TLR1/2 and 
TLR2/6 heterodimers increases its potential to act as good adjuvant in other 
vaccine formulations.","DOI: 10.1128/IAI.00121-21

the activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway following ALI. ALI model 
was established by intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
to female BALB/c mice. In L. casei LC2W group, mice were intragastrically 
administrated L. casei LC2W for a week, before the ALI modeling. The serum of 
normal BALB/c mice after intragastric administration of L. casei LC2W was used 
for in vitro cell assays. The serum was pre-incubated with mouse macrophage cell 
line (RAW264.7) and human lung cell line (HLF-A), then LPS was added to 
co-incubate. Compared with ALI model group, L. casei LC2W pretreatment 
significantly reduced lung pathological damage, the number of neutrophils and 
total cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Besides, L. casei LC2W pretreatment 
could significantly reverse the abnormal expression of ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF-α and 
IL-10 in lung tissue and serum, plus, L. casei LC2W significantly reduced the 
phosphorylation levels of IRAK-1 and NF-κB p65. In vitro, the serum decreased 
the up-regulation of IL-6 and TNF-α in cell lines induced by LPS. In conclusion, 
L. casei LC2W intragastric administration pretreatment could significantly

for vascular diseases and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysregulation has 
been widely implicated in NIH. Neutrophil elastase is a potential therapeutic 
target for multiple diseases. We investigated the role of neutrophil elastase in 
VSMC functions and injury-induced NIH and explored the therapeutic potential of 
targeting neutrophil elastase in NIH.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: VSMCs were used to analyse the effects of neutrophil 
elastase. Proteomic analysis was used to identify potential neutrophil elastase 
targets. Artery injury model and neutrophil elastase inhibitor GW311616A were 
used to investigate the role of neutrophil elastase in NIH.
KEY RESULTS: TNF-α up-regulated neutrophil elastase in VSMCs through modulating 
GAPBα/Runx1/CEBPα/c-Myb signalling. Up-regulated neutrophil elastase promoted 
VSMC migration, proliferation and inflammation. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was 
identified as a target protein for neutrophil elastase in VSMCs and the 
TLR4/MyD88/IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB regulatory axis was shown to be the signalling 
pathway for neutrophil elastase in VSMC pathology. Importantly, TLR4 inhibition 
abolished neutrophil elastase-mediated VSMC dysregulation. Injury-induced NIH 
was significantly reduced in both neutrophil elastase-deficient mice and mice 
treated with GW311616A. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps was 
impaired in injured arteries from neutrophil elastase-deficient mice. Finally, a 
similar role for neutrophil elastase in human VSMC pathology was confirmed and 
we observed higher expression levels of neutrophil elastase but lower expression 
levels of TLR4 in human atherosclerotic lesions.

mechanisms underlying NIH and identify neutrophil elastase as a potential 
therapeutic target for vascular disease.",© 2021 The British Pharmacological Society.,"DOI: 10.1111/bph.15583

thrombocytopenia (ITP), the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. 
Here, we attempted to investigate whether BMSCs can regulate Th17/Treg imbalance 
in ITP through the exosome pathway. We first assessed the proportions of Th17 
cells and Tregs in ITP patients, showing that ITP patients exhibited an evident 
imbalance of Th17/Treg. BMSCs-exosomes' treatment significantly reduced 
Th17/Treg ratio in the CD4+ T cells of ITP patients. Moreover, miR-146a-5p was 
highly expressed in BMSCs-exosomes. The expression of miR-146a-5p was obviously 
increased in CD4+ T cells following the treatment of BMSCs-exosomes. 
BMSCs-exosomal miR-146a-5p silencing promoted the proportions of Th17 cells and 
repressed the proportions of Tregs in CD4+ T cells. In addition, miR-146a-5p 
directly interacted with IL-1R-associated kinase-1 (IRAK), and repressed IRAK1 
expression. IRAK1 overexpression promoted Th17/Treg ratio in CD4+ T cells, which 
was abolished by BMSCs-exosomal miR-146a-5p. In conclusion, these findings 
demonstrate that BMSC-derived exosomal miR-146a-5p regulates Th17/Treg imbalance

different cobalt sources [cobalt glucoheptonate (CoPro) or cobalt pectin 
(CoPectin)], folic acid (FOA), and rumen-protected methionine (RPM) were used to 
study neonatal immune responses after ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
challenge. Groups were (n = 12 calves/group) CoPro, FOA+CoPro, FOA+CoPectin, and 
FOA+CoPectin+RPM. Calves were weighed at birth and blood collected at birth 
(before colostrum), 21 d of age, and 42 d of age (at weaning). Growth 
performance was recorded once a week during the first 6 wk of age. Energy 
metabolism, inflammation, and antioxidant status were assessed at birth through 
various plasma biomarkers. Whole blood was challenged with 3 µg/mL of LPS or 
used for phagocytosis and oxidative burst assays. Target genes evaluated by 
real-time quantitative PCR in whole blood samples were associated with immune 
response, antioxidant function, and 1-carbon metabolism. The response in mRNA 
abundance in LPS challenged versus nonchallenged samples was assessed via Δ = 
LPS challenged - LPS nonchallenged samples. Phagocytosis capacity and oxidative 
burst activity were measured in neutrophils and monocytes, with data reported as 
ratio (percentage) of CD14 to CH138A-positive cells. Data including all time 
points were subjected to ANOVA using PROC MIXED in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.), 
with Treatment, Sex, Age, and Treatment × Age as fixed effects. A 1-way ANOVA 
was used to determine differences at birth, with Treatment and Sex as fixed 
effects. Calf birth body weight and other growth parameters did not differ 
between groups. At birth, plasma haptoglobin concentration was lower in 
FOA+CoPro compared with CoPro calves. We detected no effect for other plasma 
biomarkers or immune function due to maternal treatments at birth. Compared with 
CoPro, in response to LPS challenge, whole blood from FOA+CoPectin and 
FOA+CoPectin+RPM calves had greater mRNA abundance of intercellular adhesion 
molecule 1 (ICAM1). No effect for other genes was detectable. Regardless of 
maternal treatments, sex-specific responses were observed due to greater plasma 
concentrations of haptoglobin, paraoxonase, total reactive oxygen metabolites, 
nitrite, and β-carotene in female versus male calves at birth. In contrast, 
whole blood from male calves had greater mRNA abundance of IRAK1, CADM1, and 
ITGAM in response to LPS challenge at birth. The longitudinal analysis of d 0, 
21, and 42 data revealed greater bactericidal permeability-increasing protein 
(BPI) mRNA abundance in whole blood from FOA+CoPectin versus FOA+CoPro calves, 
coupled with greater abundance in FOA+CoPro compared with CoPro calves. 
Regardless of maternal treatments, most genes related to cytokines and cytokine 
receptors (IL1B, IL10, TNF, IRAK1, CXCR1), toll-like receptor pathway (TLR4, 
NFKB1), adhesion and migration (ICAM1, ITGAM), antimicrobial function (MPO), and 
antioxidant function (GPX1) were downregulated over time. Phagocytosis capacity 
and oxidative burst activity in both neutrophils and monocytes did not differ 
due to maternal treatment. Regardless of maternal treatments, we observed an 
increase in the percentage of neutrophils capable of phagocytosis and oxidative 
burst activity over time. Overall, these preliminary assessments suggested that 
maternal supplementation with FOA and Co combined with RPM had effects on a few 
plasma biomarkers of inflammation at birth and molecular responses associated 
with inflammatory mechanisms during the neonatal period.","The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. and Fass Inc. on behalf of the American

meningitis, and E. coli meningitis is associated with high mortality and 
morbidity throughout the world. Our previous study showed that E. coli can 
colonize the brain and cause neuroinflammation. Increasing evidence supports the 
involvement of miRNAs as key regulators of neuroinflammation. However, it is not 
clear whether these molecules participate in the regulation of meningitic E. 
coli-mediated neuroinflammation.
METHODS: The levels of miR-155 and miR-146a, as well as their precursors, in E. 
coli-infected astrocytes were measured using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). 
Overexpression and knockdown studies of miR-155 and miR-146a were performed to 
observe the effects on bacterial loads, cytokines, chemokines, and NF-κB 
signaling pathways. Bioinformatics methods were utilized to predict the target 
genes, and these target genes were validated using qPCR, Western blotting, and 
luciferase reporter system. In vivo knockdown of miR-155 and miR-146a was 
carried out to observe the effects on bacterial loads, inflammatory genes, 
astrocyte activation, microglia activation, and survival in a mouse model.
RESULTS: The levels of miR-155, miR-146a, and their precursors were 
significantly increased in astrocytes during E. coli infection. miR-155 and 
miR-146a were induced by the NF-κB-p65 signaling pathway upon infection. 
Overexpressing and inhibiting miR-155 and miR-146a in astrocytes did not affect 
the bacterial loads. Further, the in vitro overexpression of miR-155 and 
miR-146a suppressed the E. coli-induced inflammatory response, whereas the 
inhibition of miR-155 and miR-146a enhanced it. Mechanistically, miR-155 
inhibited TAB2, and miR-146a targeted IRAK1 and TRAF6; therefore, they 
functioned collaboratively to modulate TLR-mediated NF-κB signaling. In 
addition, both miR-155 and miR-146a could regulate the EGFR-NF-κB signaling 
pathway. Finally, the in vivo suppression of E. coli-induced miR-155 and 
miR-146a further promoted the production of inflammatory cytokines, aggravated 
astrocyte and microglia activation, and decreased mouse survival time, without 
affecting the bacterial loads in the blood and brain.
CONCLUSIONS: E. coli infection induced miR-155 and miR-146a, which collectively 
regulated bacteria-triggered neuroinflammatory responses through negative 
feedback regulation involving the TLR-mediated NF-κB and EGFR-NF-κB signaling 
pathways, thus protecting the central nervous system from further 
neuroinflammatory damage.","DOI: 10.1186/s12974-021-02165-4

signaling proteins into oligomeric complexes. The Myddosome is an oligomeric 
complex that is required to transmit inflammatory signals from TLR/IL1Rs and 
consists of MyD88 and IRAK family kinases. However, the molecular basis for how 
Myddosome proteins self-assemble and regulate intracellular signaling remains 
poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel assay to analyze the 
spatiotemporal dynamics of IL1R and Myddosome signaling in live cells. We found 
that MyD88 oligomerization is inducible and initially reversible. Moreover, the 
formation of larger, stable oligomers consisting of more than four MyD88s 
triggers the sequential recruitment of IRAK4 and IRAK1. Notably, genetic 
knockout of IRAK4 enhanced MyD88 oligomerization, indicating that IRAK4 controls 
MyD88 oligomer size and growth. MyD88 oligomer size thus functions as a physical 
threshold to trigger downstream signaling. These results provide a mechanistic

common genetic variants associate with infection susceptibility in Finnish 
diabetic individuals. We performed genome-wide association studies and pathway 
analysis for bacterial infection frequency in Finnish adult diabetic individuals 
(FinnDiane Study; N = 5092, Diabetes Registry Vaasa; N = 4247) using national 
register data on antibiotic prescription purchases. Replication analyses were 
performed in a Swedish diabetic population (ANDIS; N = 9602) and in a Finnish 
non-diabetic population (FinnGen; N = 159,166). Genome-wide data indicated 
moderate but significant narrow-sense heritability for infection susceptibility 
(h2 = 16%, P = 0.02). Variants on chromosome 2 were associated with reduced 
infection susceptibility (rs62192851, P = 2.23 × 10-7). Homozygotic carriers of 
the rs62192851 effect allele (N = 44) had a 37% lower median annual antibiotic 
purchase rate, compared to homozygotic carriers of the reference allele 
(N = 4231): 0.38 [IQR 0.22-0.90] and 0.60 [0.30-1.20] respectively, P = 0.01). 
Variants rs6727834 and rs10188087, in linkage disequilibrium with rs62192851, 
replicated in the FinnGen-cohort (P < 0.05), but no variants replicated in the 
ANDIS-cohort. Pathway analysis suggested the IRAK1 mediated NF-κB activation 
through IKK complex recruitment-pathway to be a mediator of the phenotype.

higher in the elderly patients undergoing surgery. Microglia activation-mediated 
neuroinflammation is one of the hallmarks of PND. Galectin-1 has been identified 
as a pivotal modulator in the central nervous system (CNS), while the role of 
galectin-1 in PND induced by microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is still 
undetermined.
METHODS: An exploratory laparotomy model anesthetized with isoflurane was 
employed to investigate the role of galectin-1 on PND in aged mice. Open field 
test and Morris water maze were used to test the cognitive function 3- or 7-days 
post-surgery. The activation of microglia in the hippocampus of aged mice was 
tested by immunohistochemistry. Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were 
employed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
RESULTS: Galectin-1 attenuated the cognitive dysfunction induced by surgery in 
aged mice and inhibited microglial activity. Moreover, galectin-1 decreased the 
expression level of inflammatory proteins (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and 
tumor necrosis factor-α), and prevented neuronal loss in the hippocampus. 
Galectin-1 inhibited the inflammation of BV2 microglial cells induced by 
lipopolysaccharide via decreasing the translocation of NF-κB p65 and c-Jun, 
while this kind of inhibition was rescued when overexpressing IRAK1.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that galectin-1 may inhibit IRAK1 
expression, thus suppressing inflammatory response, inhibiting 
neuroinflammation, and improving ensuing cognitive dysfunction. Collectively, 
these findings unveil that galectin-1 may elicit protective effects on 
surgery-induced neuroinflammation and neurocognitive disorders.","© 2021 The Authors. CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics published by John Wiley &

many diseases, especially inflammation. Therefore, we analyzed and explored the

expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in

kinase activity of IRAK1 and IRAK4, the most upstream factors of the AP-1

although its etiology remains to be elucidated. microRNA (miR)‑146a is suggested 
to regulate innate immune and inflammatory responses. However, it is unclear 
whether miR‑146a is involved in depression. Depression model mice were 
established using lipopolysaccharide‑induced depression and chronic 
unpredictable mild stress, separately. miR‑146a mimic and short interfering RNA 
were used to treat depressed mice. Depression‑like behaviors and levels of 
pro‑inflammatory cytokines were measured, while ionized calcium binding adapter 
molecule 1 (Iba‑1) expression in hippocampus was quantified by 
immunohistochemistry. Neuroinflammatory factor levels in hippocampus were 
measured by western blotting. BV‑2 cells were used to confirm that miR‑146a 
suppressed microglia activation. Compared with control mice, the two depressed 
mouse models showed clearly decreased sucrose preference and significantly 
increased immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test 
(P<0.05). miR‑146a overexpression significantly increased sucrose preference and 
reduced immobility time in depressed mice (P<0.05). However, total distance

characterized a purified polysaccharide from the aerial part of Tetrastigma 
hemsleyanum (SYQP) and found it having antipyretic and antitumor effects in 
mice. A preliminary mechanistic study suggests these effects may be related to 
the binding of toll-like receptor (TLR4). The objective of this study is to 
further explore the detailed stimulating characteristics of SYQP on TLR4 
signaling pathway and its in vivo immune regulating effect. We use HEK-BLUE 
hTLR4, mouse and human macrophage cell lines, as research tools. In vitro 
results show SYQP activated HEK-BLUE hTLR4 instead of HEK-BLUE Null cells. The 
secretion and the mRNA expression of cytokines related to TLR4 signaling 
significantly increased after SYQP treatment in both PMA-induced THP-1 and 
RAW264.7 macrophage cell lines. The TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 can almost 
completely abolish this activation. Furthermore, molecules such as IRAK1, NF-κB, 
MAPKs, and IRF3 in both the MyD88 and TRIF branches were all activated without 
pathway selection. In vivo results show SYQP enhanced antigen-specific spleen 
lymphocyte proliferation and serum IgG levels in OVA-immunized C57BL/6 mice. 
Orally administered 200 mg/kg SYQP induced obvious tumor regression, spleen 
weight increase, and the upregulation of the mRNA expression of TLR4-related

To construct in vitro and in vivo inflammatory lung models, cells from the human

weight (BW), tracheal lumen injection], respectively. The A549 cells were 
preincubated with lactoferrin (10 mg/mL), and the mice were intraperitoneally 
injected with lactoferrin (100 mg/kg of BW), followed by LPS treatment. The 
concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) in culture medium 
of A549 cells and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the mice were determined 
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The toll-like receptor 4-related 
pathway (TLR4/MyD88/IRAK1/TRAF6/NFκB) was determined at gene and protein 
expression levels in A549 cells and mouse lung tissue. Results showed that LPS 
treatment significantly elevated the concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α in the 
A549 cell culture medium and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the mice; it 
also elevated both the mRNA and protein expressions of TLR4 and the TLR4 
downstream factors in A549 cells and mouse lung tissue. Nevertheless, 
lactoferrin apparently depressed the releases of IL-1β and TNF-α from A549 cells 
and lung tissues stimulated by LPS, and significantly suppressed the TLR4 
signaling pathway. Lactoferrin also promoted the enhancement of miR-146a 
expression in A549 cells and mouse lung tissue. Moreover, 100°C heating for 3 
min caused total loss of the previously listed bioactivity of lactoferrin.

(25 mg/kg). We found that the tail vein injection of IRN (4 mg/kg) significantly

alleviated PQ-induced renal injury and renal dysfunction in rats, as evidenced 
by decreased apoptosis in renal cortex and reduced serum creatinine, serum BUN,

oxidative stress in renal cortex by increasing the levels of anti-oxidant 
indicators (SOD activity, GSH/GSSG ratio, levels of Nrf-2, NQO-1, and HO-1 in

negative regulator of interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) 
phosphorylation, was demonstrated to be increased by IRN injection in the renal 
cortex of PQ-intoxicated rats. In vitro experiments revealed that IRN protected 
renal tubular epithelial cells against PQ toxicity through suppressing oxidative 
stress and mitochondrial damage, and these protective effects were reversed by 
Tollip shRNA. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that IRN ameliorated

associated with an impairment of the epithelial barrier, in which tight 
junctions and/or filaggrin expression can be defective. Skin barrier assessment 
shows potential to be clinically useful for prediction of disease development, 
improved and earlier diagnosis, lesion follow-up, and therapy evaluation. This 
study aimed to establish a method to directly assess the in vivo status of 
epithelial barrier using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
METHODS: Thirty-six patients with AD were followed during their 3-week 
hospitalization and compared with 28 controls. EIS and transepidermal water loss 
(TEWL) were measured in lesional and non-lesional skin. Targeted proteomics by 
proximity extension assay in serum and whole-genome sequence were performed.
RESULTS: Electrical impedance spectroscopy was able to assess epithelial barrier 
integrity, differentiate between patients and controls without AD, and 
characterize lesional and non-lesional skin of patients. It showed a significant 
negative correlation with TEWL, but a higher sensitivity to discriminate 
non-lesional atopic skin from controls. During hospitalization, lesions reported 
a significant increase in EIS that correlated with healing, decreased SCORAD and 
itch scores. Additionally, EIS showed a significant inverse correlation with 
serum biomarkers associated with inflammatory pathways that may affect the 
epithelial barrier, particularly chemokines such as CCL13, CCL3, CCL7, and CXCL8 
and other cytokines, such as IRAK1, IRAK4, and FG2, which were significantly 
high at admission. Furthermore, filaggrin copy numbers significantly correlated 
with EIS on non-lesional skin of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Electrical impedance spectroscopy can be a useful tool to detect 
skin barrier dysfunction in vivo, valuable for the assessment of AD severity, 
progression, and therapy efficacy.","© 2021 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons

healing capacity, a typical feature that declines during aging and is negatively 
affected by the persistence of inflammation and oxidative stress. To this aim, 
first, PSF anti-inflammatory properties were tested on young and senescent 
LPS-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). As a result, PSF 
treatment increased miR-146a and decreased IRAK-1 and IL-6 expression levels. In 
addition, the PSF antioxidant effect was validated in vitro with DPPH assay and 
confirmed by in vivo treatments in C. elegans. Our findings showed beneficial 
effects on worms' lifespan and healthspan with positive outcomes on longevity 
markers (i.e., miR-124 upregulation and miR-39 downregulation) as well. The PSF 
effect on wound healing was tested using the same cells and experimental 
conditions employed to investigate PSF antioxidant and anti-inflammaging 
ability. PSF treatment resulted in a significant improvement of wound healing 
closure (ca. 70%), through cell migration, both in young and older cells, 
associated to a downregulation of inflammation markers. In conclusion, PSF 
extract antioxidant and anti-inflammaging abilities result in improved wound 
healing capacity, thus suggesting that PSF might be helpful to improve the

""Shenshu""(BL23) on synovitis, and expressions of miR-155, Toll-like receptor 4 
(TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interlukine（IL-1）

factor 6 (TRAF6), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor 
receptor (TNF)-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein of synovial membrane in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) rats, so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of 
RA.
METHODS: A total of 48 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal 
control, model, moxibustion and antagonist groups (n=12 rats in each group). The 
RA model was replicated by placing the rats in a wind, cold and wet environment 
and injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA, 0.5 mL) into the right 
hindlimb foot plantar. Moxibustion was applied to bilateral ST36 and BL23 for 30 
min, once daily for 21 consecutive days. Rats of the antagonist group was 
treated by injection of TLR4 antagonist (TAK-242, 1 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/kg) via tail 
vein, once per day for consecutive 21 d. The joint swelling degree (JSD) and 
arthritis index (AI, red swelling scale) were determined, and the expression 
levels of various indicators of miR-155, and TLR4, myeloid MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, 
NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein were assayed by quantitative real 
time-PCR and Western blot, separately.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the JSD and AI, and the 
expression levels of synovial miR-155, TLR4, MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, NF-κB, IL-1β, 
TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein were significantly increased in the model group 
(P<0.01). Compared with the model group, the increased levels of JSD and AI, and 
the expression levels of synovial miR-155, TLR4, MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, NF-κB, 
IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein were notably down-regulated in both 
moxibustion and antagonist groups (P<0.01). The effects of moxibustion were 
evidently superior to the antagonist in down-regulating the abovementioned 
indexes (P<0.01), except TLR4 mRNA and protein.
CONCLUSION: Moxibustion at ST36 and BL23 can reduce the synovitis of RA rats, 
which is related to its effects in suppressing the expressions of miR-155, TLR4, 
MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein (i.e.,

prescription derived from the Xianglian pill, which is a traditional Chinese 
medicine for treating chronic dysentery recorded in the Taiping Huimin Heji 
Bureau [1078-1085]. For many years, TCXYT has been used to treat ulcerative 
colitis, however, its therapeutic mechanism is still unclear. In the present 
study, we used colonic lamina propria macrophages (LPM) and mouse-derived 
macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells as the research objects, with the aim of 
exploring the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of TCXYT on colitis.
METHODS: We used 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce a rat model 
of chronic colitis, and normal rats as the control. The disease activity index 
(DAI) and colonic histopathological changes of rats were used to evaluate the 
severity of colitis. Rats were divided into the control group; model group; 
high, middle-, and low-dose TCXYT group; and the hydroxychloroquine sulfate 
group. TCXYT was administered by gavage on the 3rd day after model replication 
and lasted for 7 days. The doses used for the high-, middle-, and low-dose TCXYT 
groups were 0.8, 0.4 and 0.2 g/kg, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay was used to detect the serum concentration of cytokines. Western blot was 
used to detect the expressions of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), myeloid 
differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), interleukin (IL) 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1, and IRAK4 in colonic LPM and RAW264.7 
cells. Immunofluorescence was used to detect lysosomal activity. The chemical 
constituents of TCXYT were separated and identified based on Q-Orbitrap high 
resolution LC/MS data.
RESULTS: TCXYT promoted the repair of colonic mucosal injury, attenuated 
inflammation, increased lysosome activity in macrophages, and decreased the DAI 
in rats with colitis compared with those in the model group. TCXYT decreased the 
serum concentrations of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), increased 
those of IL-4 and IL-10, and decreased the TLR9, MyD88, IRAK1, and IRAK4 protein 
levels in LPM and RAW264.7 cells compared to the model group.
CONCLUSIONS: TCXYT could ameliorate colon inflammation and CD11c+ macrophage 
infiltration in rats with chronic colitis. This effect may be mediated by 
activating lysosomes in macrophages by inhibiting the TLR9/MyD88/IRAK signaling 
pathway.","DOI: 10.21037/apm-21-250

    J Thorac Dis. 2021 Jul;13(7):4623-4624.","BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis (MF) is thought to be associated with 
constrictive pericarditis (CP). miR-146a has been reported to be related to the 
survival of myocardial fibroblasts and related signal transduction pathways. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the expression of miR-146a in CP with MF 
and the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) signaling pathway, to 
understand the molecular mechanism of MF involvement in CP.
METHODS: Thirty rats with different disease duration were randomly divided into 
three groups: an 8-week model group (CP-8W group), a 16-week model group (CP-16W 
group) model, and a normal control group (N group). After the CP model was 
established in the rats, the myocardial tissues were collected. The expression 
of miR-146a, the key factors of TLR-4 signaling pathway, including IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated 
factor 6 (TRAF6), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and p-NF-κB, and the MF indicator 
α-SMA in myocardial tissue were detected. After treatment with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), primary cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were 
transfected with miR-146a. RT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the 
expression of downstream effectors to further verify the function of miRNA-146a 
in regulating MF via the TLR-4 signaling pathway.
RESULTS: miR-146a was increased in the CP-8W group but not in the CP-16W group. 
IRAK1 and TRAF6 in the CP-16W group were found to be higher than in the N group 
and CP-8W group. α-SMA in the model groups was higher than in the N group. 
Compared with the CP-8W group, α-SMA in the CP-16W model group was further 
increased. In the experiments using CFs, the expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, p-NF-κB 
and α-SMA increased in the LPS-treated group compared with the N group. After 
transfection of CFs with the miR-146a mimics, the expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, 
p-NF-κB and α-SMA decreased compared with the LPS-treated group. Following 
transfection of CFs with miR-146a inhibitors, the expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, 
p-NF-κB and α-SMA increased compared with the LPS-treated group.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of miR-146a demonstrated a dynamic change in the CP 
model; it was increased at the early time point (CP-8W) and then decreased at 
the 16W time point. miR-146a suppressed MF by inhibiting the target genes TRAF6 
and IRAK1 via the TLR-4 signaling pathway.",2021 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-20-2716

severe febrile arthritis which may persist for months, or encephalitis which can 
lead to death or lifelong cognitive impairments. The non-assembly molecular 
role(s), functions, and protein-protein interactions of the alphavirus capsid 
proteins have been largely overlooked. Here we detail the use of a BioID2 biotin 
ligase system to identify the protein-protein interactions of the Sindbis virus 
capsid protein. These efforts led to the discovery of a series of novel 
host-pathogen interactions, including the identification of an interaction 
between the alphaviral capsid protein and the host IRAK1 protein. Importantly, 
this capsid-IRAK1 interaction is conserved across multiple alphavirus species, 
including arthritogenic alphaviruses SINV, Ross River virus, and Chikungunya 
virus; and encephalitic alphaviruses Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus, and 
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus. The impact of the capsid-IRAK1 interaction 
was evaluated using a robust set of cellular model systems, leading to the 
realization that the alphaviral capsid protein specifically inhibits 
IRAK1-dependent signaling. This inhibition represents a means by which 
alphaviruses may evade innate immune detection and activation prior to viral 
gene expression. Altogether, these data identify novel capsid protein-protein 
interactions, establish the capsid-IRAK1 interaction as a common alphavirus 
host-pathogen interface, and delineate the molecular consequences of the 
capsid-IRAK1 interaction on IRAK1-dependent signaling.","DOI: 10.3390/v13030377

Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.","The outcome of Leishmania donovani infection depends upon the dynamic 
interchanges between M1 and M2 macrophages. Information of the involvement of 
microRNAs (miRNAs) and epigenetic modifiers in regulating macrophage plasticity 
during L. donovani infection is still elusive. Differential expression analysis 
of polarization-regulating miRNAs, revealed significant enrichment of miR146a-5p 
during Leishmania donovani infection. A sustained enrichment of miR146a-5p was 
observed in both infected bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and BALB/c 
mice organs. We found involvement of miR146a-5p in phagocytosis and 
survivability of parasites. Moreover, miR146a-5pgot enriched in interleukin 4- 
stimulated BMDMs, indicating its possible involvement in M2 polarization. Upon 
transfecting BMDMs with miRVANA anti-146a oligos, M2 markers (CCR7, YM-1, 
FIZZ-1, arginase-1, IL10 and IL4) and transcription factors (p-STAT6 and c/EBPβ) 
got depleted with concomitant augmentation of M1-polarizing transcription 
factors (p-STAT1, AP1 and IRF-1), miR146a target genes (TRAF6 and IRAK1), M1 
cytokines (IL12 and TNFα), iNOS, nitric oxide, and nuclear translocation of 
phospho p-65 subunit. Neutralization of intracellular mature miR146a-5p pool in 
infected BALB/c mice lower organ parasite burden and expressions of M2 markers 
and IL10 with enrichment of M1 markers like iNOS and IL12. Additionally, we 
explored the novel role of super enhancer (SE), a cis-acting regulatory 
component, to enrich miR146a-5p expression during infection. Enhanced expression 
and nuclear retention of SE components like BET bromodomain 4 (BRD4) and p300 
were found in infected BMDMs. Upon silencing BRD4, expressions of miR146a-5p and 
M2 markers were down regulated and TRAF6, IRAK1 and iNOS levels increased. 
STRING V.11 based predication and immune precipitation confirmed the strong 
interaction amongst BRD4, p300 and RNA pol II (RpbI). Chromatin immune 
precipitation studies suggested the recruitment of BRD4 at the enhancer loci of 
miR146a-5p gene during infection. Altogether, our findings revealed a novel role 
of BRD4/p300-depdendent super-enhancer in regulating miR146a expression during 
L. donovani infection which in turn mediates M2 polarization and 
immune-suppression.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009343

in the β-cell destruction of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), but functional 
association remains poorly understood. Here, we aimed to verify the role of 
LncRNA SRA regulation in β-cells. LncRNA SRAs were highly expressed in plasma 
samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from T1D patients. LncRNA 
SRA was strongly upregulated by high-glucose treatment. LncRNA SRA acts as a 
microRNA (miR)-146b sponge through direct sequence-structure interactions. 
Silencing of lncRNA SRA increased the functional genes of Tregs, resulting in 
metabolic reprogramming, such as decreased lactate levels, repressed lactate 
dehydrogenase A (LDHA)/phosphorylated LDHA (pLDHA at Tyr10) expression, 
decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increased ATP production, 
and finally, decreased β-cell apoptosis in vitro. There was a positive 
association between lactate level and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level in the plasma 
from patients with T1D. Recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 treatment repressed 
lncRNA SRA expression and activity in β-cells. Higher levels of 
lncRNA-SRA/lactate in the plasma are associated with poor regulation in T1D 
patients. LncRNA SRA contributed to T1D pathogenesis through the inhibition of 
miR-146b in β-cells, with activating signaling transduction of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1)/LDHA/pLDHA. Taken together, LncRNA SRA 
plays a critical role in the function of β-cells.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms22041720

pathophysiology and etiology are still unknown. Recent findings suggest that 
aberrant inflammatory regulation and microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved. Here we 
performed a comparative analysis of the global miRNome of human induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-astrocytes, derived from SCZ patients and healthy 
controls (CTRLs), at baseline and following inflammatory modulation using IL-1β. 
We identified four differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-337-3p, miR-127-5p, 
miR-206, miR-1185-1-3p) in SCZ astrocytes that exhibited significantly lower 
baseline expression relative to CTRLs. Group-specific differential expression 
(DE) analyses exploring possible distinctions in the modulatory capacity of 
IL-1β on miRNA expression in SCZ versus CTRL astroglia revealed trends toward 
altered miRNA expressions. In addition, we analyzed peripheral blood samples 
from a large cohort of SCZ patients (n = 484) and CTRLs (n = 496) screening for 
the expression of specific gene targets of the four DE miRNAs that were 
identified in our baseline astrocyte setup. Three of these genes, LAMTOR4, 
IL23R, and ERBB3, had a significantly lower expression in the blood of SCZ 
patients compared to CTRLs after multiple testing correction. We also found 
nominally significant differences for ERBB2 and IRAK1, which similarly displayed 
lower expressions in SCZ versus CTRL. Furthermore, we found matching patterns

However, the mechanisms through which miRNAs regulate wound healing under normal 
and diabetic conditions are poorly understood. We aimed to determine the effects 
of miR-146a on the pathogenesis of wound healing in normal and streptozotocin 
(STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Approach: Wild-type (WT) and miR-146a knockout (KO) 
mice were induced to develop diabetes with STZ. Next, skin and corneal wounds 
were produced and measured. Percent wound closure and histology were evaluated. 
Inflammation at wound sites was analyzed using flow cytometry, 
reverse-transcription PCR, and western blot. Results: Healing of wounded skin 
was significantly delayed in miR-146a KO compared with WT mice. However, corneal 
epithelial wound healing did not differ significantly in the mice with normal 
blood glucose, whereas corneal and skin wound healing was significantly delayed 
in KO mice with diabetes. Neutrophil infiltration increased in skin wounds of KO 
compared with normal mice. The potential mechanisms were associated with 
dysregulated interleukin 1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IRAK1 
(interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1), TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated 
factor 6), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling induced by miR-146a KO. 
Innovation: Skin wound healing was delayed in miR-146a KO mice and enhanced 
inflammatory responses were mediated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. 
Conclusions: Deficiency in miR-146a delayed skin wound healing by enhancing 
inflammatory responses in normal and diabetic mice. Therefore, miR-146a may be a

phosphorylation of specific residues in their target substrate proteins. They 
play important role for regulation of life and death decisions. The complexity 
of the relationship between death receptors and protein kinases' cell death 
decision-making mechanisms create many difficulties in the treatment of various 
diseases. The most of fifteen different cell death pathways, which are reported 
by Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) are protein kinase signal 
transduction-mediated negative or positive selections. Tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) as a main player of death pathways is a dual-functioning molecule in that 
it can promote both cell survival or cell death. All apoptotic and necrotic 
signal transductions are conveyed through death domain-containing death 
receptors, which are expressed on the surface of nearly all human cells. In 
humans, eight members of the death receptor family have been identified. While 
the interaction of TNF with TNF Receptor 1 (TNFR1) activates various signal 
transduction pathways, different death receptors activate three main signal 
transduction pathways: nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB)-mediated differentiation 
or pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK)-mediated stress response and caspase-mediated apoptosis. The link between 
the NF-ĸB and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways comprise another 
check-point to regulate cell death. TNF-α also promotes the 
""receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1"" (RIPK1)/RIPK3/ mixed 
lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL)-dependent necrosis. Thus, 
necrosome is mainly comprised of MLKL, RIPK3 and, in some cases, RIPK1. In fact, 
RIPK1 is at the crossroad between life and death, downstream of various 
receptors as a regulator of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced death. TNFR1 
signaling complex (TNF-RSC), which contains multiple kinase activities, promotes 
phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), 
inhibitor of nuclear transcription factor κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) α/IKKβ, IκBα, 
and NF-κB. IKKs affect cell-survival pathways in NF-κB-independent manner. 
Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation triggers various signaling pathways 
dependent on myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88), Interleukin-1 receptor 
(IL-1R)-associated kinase (IRAK1), IRAK2 and IRAK4, lead to post-translational 
activation of nucleotide and oligomerization domain (NLRP3). Thereby, cell fate 
decisions following TLR signaling is parallel with death receptor signaling. 
Inhibition of IKKα/IKKβ or its upstream activators sensitize cells to death by 
inducing RIPK1-dependent apoptosis or necroptosis. During apoptosis, several 
kinases of the NF-κB pathway, including IKK1 and NF-κB essential modulator 
(NEMO), are cleaved by cellular caspases. This event can terminate the 
NF-κB-derived survival signals. In both canonical and non-canonical pathways, 
IKK is key to NF-κB activation. Whereas, the activation process of IKK, the 
functions of NEMO ubiquitination, IKK-related non-canonical pathway and the 
nuclear transportation of NEMO and functions of IKKα are still debated in cell 
death. In addition, cluster of differentiation 95 (CD95)-mediated non-apoptotic 
signaling and CD95- death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) interactions are 
waiting for clarification.","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-49844-3_1

polyangiitis (GPA) is a chronic systemic vasculitis distinguished by the 
presence of anti-proteinase-3 autoantibodies (anti-PR3). In this study we 
analyzed the molecular signature of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) 
in response to neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs were 
obtained from anti-PR3-activated neutrophils, purified and characterized by flow 
cytometry, nanoparticle tracking and miRNA screening. HUVECs were stimulated 
with EVs and miRNA/mRNA expression was measured. Cell culture media proteins 
were identified by antibody microarrays and selected cytokines were measured. 
Comparison of differentially expressed miRNAs/mRNAs between non-stimulated and 
EV-stimulated HUVECs revealed two regulatory patterns. Significant up-regulation 
of 14 mRNA transcripts (including CXCL8, DKK1, IL1RL1, ANGPT-2, THBS1 and 
VCAM-1) was accompanied by 11 miRNAs silencing (including miR-661, miR-664a-3p, 
miR-377-3p, miR-30d-5p). Significant down-regulation was observed for nine mRNA 
transcripts (including FASLG, CASP8, STAT3, GATA3, IRAK1 and IL6) and 
accompanied by up-regulation of 10 miRNAs (including miR-223-3p, miR-142-3p, 
miR-211-5p). Stimulated HUVECs released IL-8, Dickkopf-related protein 1 
(DKK-1), soluble interleukin (IL)-1 like receptor-1 (ST2), growth 
differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), angiopoietin-2, endoglin, thrombospondin-1 
and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Moreover, transfection of HUVECs with 
mimics of highly expressed in EVs miR-223-3p or miR-142-3p, stimulated 
production of IL-8, ST2 and endoglin. Cytokines released by HUVECs were also 
elevated in blood of patients with GPA. The most increased were IL-8, DKK-1, 
ST2, angiopoietin-2 and IL-33. In-vitro stimulation of HUVECs by 
neutrophil-derived EVs recapitulates contribution of endothelium in autoimmune 
vasculitis. Proinflammatory phenotype of released cytokines corresponds with the 
regulatory network of miRNAs/mRNAs comprising both EVs miRNA and endothelial 
cell transcripts.",© 2021 British Society for Immunology.,"DOI: 10.1111/cei.13581

that severely impairs patients' life quality. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been 
reported to exhibit potential therapeutic effects in the management of UC. With 
the aim to investigate the regulatory effects of miR-330 on UC-related colon 
tissue damage and inflammation, a rat model of experimental colitis was 
established by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). DSS-treated 
rats showed mucosal damage, colonic inflammation, and elevated myeloperoxidase 
activity compared with the healthy controls. Dual-luciferase reporter assay 
confirmed the binding of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and 
miR-330. Subsequently, rats were intracolonically injected with miR-330 argomir 
with/without administration of IRAK1 during DSS treatment. The miR-330 
overexpression reduced DSS-induced colonic injury and the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines. The level of IRAK1 was negatively regulated by the 
expression of miR-330. IRAK1 overexpression abolished the protective effect of 
miR-330 on DSS-induced colonic inflammation and mucosal injury in rats. In 
conclusion, we clarify the role of miR-330 in pathogenesis of UC, suggesting 
miR-330 alleviated DSS-induced colitis by downregulating IRAK1, shedding lights 
on miR-330 as a therapeutic candidate for UC treatment.","© 2021 The Authors. The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences published by John

gastrointestinal diseases. The release of inflammatory cytokines mediated by 
TLR4/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling-induced immunoinflammatory activation may 
represent a common pathogenic process underlying the development of 
gastrointestinal diseases and depression. Clinical studies have indicated that 
Xiaoyaosan (XYS) can relieve depressive behavior by improving gastrointestinal 
symptoms. We previously demonstrated that XYS can reduce colonic inflammation in 
a rat model of chronic unpredictable mild stress; however, the precise 
anti-inflammatory mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we investigated 
whether XYS can ameliorate depressive behavior through regulating the TLR4/NLRP3 
inflammasome signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting immunoinflammatory activation 
and reducing colonic proinflammatory cytokine levels. Fifty-two healthy male 
Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (control, model, XYS, 
and fluoxetine). The latter three groups were subjected to 21 days of chronic 
restraint stress to generate a model of stress-induced depression. XYS and 
fluoxetine were administered intragastrically. Behavioral changes in the rats 
were assessed after 21 days. Serum and colon samples were collected, and the 
relative levels of the inflammation indicators IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were 
determined by ELISA. Pathological changes in colon tissue were assessed by 
hematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB-p65, TAK1, 
IRAK1, and TRAF6 were detected by immunohistochemistry, while the gene and 
protein expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB-p65, TAK1, IRAK1, TRAF6, NLRP3,

depressive-like behavior and the weight loss of rats with stress-induced 
depression. Furthermore, depressed rats treated with XYS exhibited decreased 
expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB-p65, TAK1, IRAK1, TRAF6, NLRP3, ASC, and

influences the productivity of small ruminants worldwide. PPRV has evolved 
several mechanisms to evade IFN-I responses. We report that a novel microRNA in 
goat PBMCs, novel miR-3, was upregulated by PPRV to facilitate virus infection. 
Furthermore, PPRV V protein alone was sufficient to induce novel miR-3 
expression, and NF-κB and p38 pathway may involved in the induction of novel 
miR-3 during PPRV infection. Importantly, we demonstrated that novel miR-3 was a 
potent negative regulator of IFN-α production by targeting IRAK1, which resulted 
in the enhancement of PPRV infection. In addition, we found that PPRV infection 
can activated ISGs through IFN independent and IRF3 dependent pathway. Moreover, 
our data revealed that novel miR-3 mediated regulation of IFN-α production may 
involve in the differential susceptibility between goat and sheep to PPRV. Taken 
together, our findings identified a new strategy taken by PPRV to escape 
IFN-I-mediated antiviral immune responses by engaging cellular microRNA and,

susceptible wildlife populations in many countries. Despite extensive research 
has been explored, the mechanism underlying PPRV immune system evasion remains 
elusive. Our data provided the first direct evidence that novel microRNA-3 
(novel miR-3) feedback inhibits type I IFN signaling when goat PBMCs are 
infected with PPRV vaccine strain N75/1, thus promoting the infection. In this 
study, the target of novel miR-3, IRAK1, which are important for PPRV-induced 
type I IFN production, have also been found. Moreover, we identified NF-κB and

effect of exosomes (Exos) produced by human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem

Our results found that injected hUMSC-Exos were able to access the site of 
ischemic damage and could be internalized by cells both in vivo and in vitro. In 
vitro, treatment with hUMSC-Exos attenuated microglia-mediated inflammation 
after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). In vivo results demonstrated that 
treatment with hUMSC-Exos significantly reduced infarct volume, attenuated 
behavioral deficits, and ameliorated microglia activation, as measured three

IL-12b expression after Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in colonic 
macrophages, as part of the innate immunity Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)-NF-κB 
activation system. This homeostatic mechanism limits excess inflammation in the 
intestinal mucosa, as it constantly interacts with the gut flora. This effect is 
reversed with Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a class I HDAC, siRNA, suggesting 
it is mediated through HDAC3. Given alveolar macrophages' prominent role in 
Acute Lung Injury (ALI), we aim to determine whether a similar regulatory 
mechanism exists in the typically sterile pulmonary microenvironment.
METHODS: Levels of mRNA and protein for IL-10, and IL-12b were determined by 
qPCR and ELISA/Western Blot respectively in naïve and LPS-stimulated alveolar 
macrophages. Expression of the NF-κB intermediaries was also similarly assessed. 
Experiments were repeated with AS101 (an IL-10 protein synthesis inhibitor), 
MS-275 (a selective class 1 HDAC inhibitor), or both.
RESULTS: LPS stimulation upregulated all proinflammatory mediators assayed in 
this study. In the presence of LPS, inhibition of IL-10 and/or class 1 HDACs 
resulted in both synergistic and independent effects on these signaling 
molecules. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR on key components of the TLR4 
signaling cascade demonstrated significant diversity in IL-10 and related gene 
expression in the presence of LPS. Inhibition of IL-10 secretion and/or class 1 
HDACs in the presence of LPS independently affected the transcription of MyD88, 
IRAK1, Rela and the NF-κB p50 subunit. Interestingly, by quantitative ELISA 
inhibition of IL-10 secretion and/or class 1 HDACs in the presence of LPS 
independently affected the secretion of not only IL-10, IL-12b, and TNFα, but 
also proinflammatory mediators CXCL2, IL-6, and MIF. These results suggest that 
IL-10 and class 1 HDAC activity regulate both independent and synergistic 
mechanisms of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Alveolar macrophages after inflammatory stimulation upregulate both 
IL-10 and IL-12b production, in a highly class 1 HDAC-dependent manner. Class 1 
HDACs appear to help maintain the balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory 
IL-12b and IL-10 respectively. Class 1 HDACs may be considered as targets for 
the macrophage-initiated pulmonary inflammation in ALI in a preclinical setting.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0245169

neonatal ALI. Initially, LPS (10 mg/kg body weight) was injected to 3-8 day old 
neonatal SD rats to induce ALI, and LPS (100 ng/ml) was used to treat lung 
epithelial cells to construct an ALI model in vitro. Next, miR-490-3p, 
pro-inflammatory factors (that included IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα), interleukin 1 
receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor associated factor 6 
(TRAF6) mRNA expression levels in lung tissues and epithelial cells were 
assessed via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. In addition, miR-490-3p 
mimics were adopted to construct its overexpressed cell model, and Cell Counting 
Kit-8 and BrdU assays were conducted to assess cell viability. Furthermore, the 
miR-490-3p target, IRAK was predicted by bioinformatics analysis and verified 
via Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The results revealed that miR-490-3p 
was markedly downregulated in an LPS-induced rat ALI model, while IL-1β, IL-6, 
TNFα, IRAK1 and TRAF6 were all upregulated and negatively correlated with 
miR-490-3p expression. Moreover, overexpressed miR-490-3p significantly 
inhibited LPS-induced lung epithelial cell injury and inflammatory response. 
Mechanistically, miR-490-3p targeted and attenuated IRAK1 expression, which thus 
inactivated the LPS-mediated TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. Overall, the present study 
indicated that miR-490-3p overexpression significantly inhibited LPS-induced ALI

effective ingredient in a decoction for the treatment of diarrhoea. However, 
there was no report on its modulatory role in inflammation.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates anti-inflammatory effect of S. brevipes in 
various inflammation models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aerial part of S. brevipes was extracted with 95% 
ethanol to produce Sb-EE. RAW264.7 cells pre-treated with Sb-EE were stimulated 
by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and Griess assay and PCR were performed. 
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, luciferase assay, 
Western blotting and kinase assay were employed. C57BL/6 mice (10 mice/group) 
were orally administered with Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) once a day for five days, and 
peritonitis was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg). ICR 
mice (four mice/group) were orally administered with Sb-EE (20 or 200 mg/kg) or 
ranitidine (positive control) twice a day for two days, and EtOH/HCl was orally 
injected to induce gastritis.
RESULTS: Sb-EE suppressed nitric oxide (NO) release (IC50=34 µg/mL) without 
cytotoxicity and contained flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol). 
Sb-EE (200 µg/mL) reduced the mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). 
Sb-EE blocked the activities of Syk and Src, while inhibiting interleukin-1 
receptor associated kinases (IRAK1) by 68%. Similarly, orally administered Sb-EE 
(200 mg/kg) suppressed NO production by 78% and phosphorylation of Src and Syk 
in peritonitis mice. Sb-EE also decreased inflammatory lesions in gastritis 
mice.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of 
Sb-EE on the inflammatory response, suggesting that Sb-EE can be developed as a

distinguished by the presence of specific U1-RNP antibodies. Information about 
its etiopathology and diagnostics is still unclear. miRNAs such as miR-146, 
miR-155, and miR-143 emerged as key regulators of the immune system, known to be 
involved in the development of autoimmune diseases and cancers. We performed an 
association study between immune-related miRNAs and MCTD severity and 
susceptibility.
METHODS: A total of 169 MCTD patients and 575 healthy subjects were recruited to 
the case-control study. The miRNA polymorphisms were genotyped using TaqMan SNP 
genotyping assay. TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ levels in serum were determined using 
ELISA. qRT-PCR of TRAF6, IRAK1, and microRNAs was performed using Taqman miRNA 
assays and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays.
RESULTS: miR-146a rs2910164 G allele and GG genotype as well as miR-143 rs713147 
A allele were more frequent in healthy subjects than in MCTD patients. miR-146a 
rs2910164 CC genotype and miR-143 T-rs353299*T-rs353291*T-rs713147*G-rs353298 
and C-rs353299*C-rs353291*T-rs713147*A-rs353298 haplotypes were associated with 
MCTD susceptibility. miR-146a rs2910164 C/T was associated with scleroderma and 
lymphadenopathy. miR-143 rs353299 C/T was associated with swollen fingers or 
hands, the presence of enlarged lymph nodes, and pericarditis/pleuritis. miR-143 
rs353298 A/G was associated with the occurrence of pericarditis/pleuritis and 
scleroderma. miR-143 rs353291 T/C showed association with 
pericarditis/pleuritis. The serum TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 levels were 
significantly higher in MCTD patients compared to healthy subjects. miR-143 SNPs 
were associated with higher proinflammatory cytokine concentration in serum only 
in healthy controls. IRAK1 and TRAF6 expression were higher in the MCTD patients 
compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our case-control study indicate the possible 
significance of miR-146a and miR-143/145 in the susceptibility and clinical 
picture of MCTD.","DOI: 10.1186/s13075-020-02403-9

affects multiple joints of the body. Currently, there is no permanent cure to 
the disease, but it can be managed with several potent drugs that cause serious 
side effects on prolonged use. Traditional remedies are considered promising for 
the treatment of several diseases, particularly chronic conditions, because they 
have lower side effects compared to synthetic drugs. In folklore, the rhizome of 
Alpinia calcarata Roscoe (Zingiberaceae) is used as a major ingredient of herbal 
formulations to treat RA. Phytoconstituents reported in A. calcarata rhizomes 
are diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoid, flavonoids, phytosterol, and volatile oils. 
The present study is intended to understand the molecular-level interaction of 
phytoconstituents present in A. calcarata rhizomes with RA molecular targets 
using computational approaches. A total of 30 phytoconstituents reported from 
the plant were used to carry out docking with 36 known targets of RA. Based on 
the docking results, 4 flavonoids were found to be strongly interacting with the 
RA targets. Further, molecular dynamics simulation confirmed stable interaction 
of quercetin with 6 targets (JAK3, SYK, MMP2, TLR8, IRAK1, and JAK1), galangin 
with 2 targets (IRAK1 and JAK1), and kaempferol (IRAK1) with one target of RA. 
Moreover, the presence of these three flavonoids was confirmed in the A. 
calcarata rhizome extract using LC-MS analysis. The computational study suggests 
that flavonoids present in A. calcarata rhizome may be responsible for RA 
modulatory activity. Particularly, quercetin and galangin could be potential 
development candidates for the treatment of RA. Investigation of Alpinia

(#)Contributed equally","Novel strategies to treat late-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma that often develop 
resistance to chemotherapy remains an unmet clinical demand. In this study, we 
identify the multi-kinase inhibitor pacritinib as capable of resensitizing the 
response to paclitaxel in an acquired resistance model. Transcriptome analysis 
of paclitaxel-sensitive and -resistant cell lines, as well as chemorefractory 
clinical samples, identified S100A9 as the top candidate gene suppressed by 
pacritinib and whose overexpression was significantly associated with paclitaxel 
resistance and poor clinical outcome. Moreover, both paclitaxel-resistant 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and relapsed/metastatic clinical samples 
exhibited increased IRAK1 phosphorylation and demonstrated that pacritinib could 
abolish the IRAK1 phosphorylation to suppress S100A9 expression. Functional 
studies in both in vitro and in vivo models showed that genetic or pharmacologic 
blockade of IRAK1 overcame the resistance to paclitaxel, and combined treatment 
of pacritinib with paclitaxel exhibited superior antitumor effect. Together, 
these findings demonstrate an important role for the IRAK1-S100A9 axis in 
mediating resistance to paclitaxel. Furthermore, targeting of IRAK1 by 
pacritinib may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance 
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. SIGNIFICANCE: Deregulation of the IRAK1-S100A9 axis 
correlates with poor prognosis, contributes to chemoresistance in nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma, and can be targeted by pacritinib to overcome chemoresistance in 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2125

undergone spinal nerve ligation (SNL), with the hypothesis that massage could be 
used as an analgesic. Forty female SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: 
the control group, sham-operated group, model group, sham massage group, and 
massage group. There were 8 rats in each group. SNL rat models were established 
in the model group, sham massage group, and massage group. Rats in the 
sham-operated group underwent surgery to expose the vertebral nerves, but no 
further procedures were performed. The control group consisted of intact 
animals. The rats in the massage group underwent massage using a massage 
simulation machine once a day for 14 d in succession; the hind limbs of the rats 
in the sham massage group were gently touched with a cloth bag once a day for 14 
continuous days. The rats in the control group, the sham-operated group, and the 
model group did not receive any intervention and were observed for 14 d. Paw 
withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) and paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) 
of rats in each group were detected 1 d before modelling and at 1, 3, 7, and 
14 d after modelling. Fourteen days after modelling, the expression levels of 
TLR4, IRAK1, TRAF6, TNF-α, and IL-6 were detected in all rats. The PWTL and PWMT 
of SNL rats were decreased, while these parameters were elevated after massage. 
SNL rats showed higher levels of TLR4, IRAK1, TRAF6, IL-6, and TNF-α, and 
massage effectively lowered the expression levels of these molecules. Inhibiting 
activation of the TLR4 signalling pathway, which can reduce the release of 
inflammatory factors, may be one mechanism by which massage treats neuropathic

coding RNA 960 (LINC00960) in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still unknown. The goal of this study is to investigate 
the role of LINC00960 in PDAC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) was used to examine the expression levels of LINC00960 in PDAC tissues 
and cell lines. After transfection, the loss-of-function models of LINC00960 or 
interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) were established with BxPC-3 
cells and Colo357 cells, and the malignant phenotypes of BxPC-3 cells and 
Colo357 cells were detected by CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay and Transwell assay, 
respectively. The interactions among LINC00960, miR-146a-5p and IRAK1 were 
predicted by bioinformatics analysis, and verified by luciferase reporter assay, 
RNA immunoprecipitation assay and RNA pull-down assay. The regulatory functions 
of LINC00960 and miR-146a-5p on IRAK1 were detected by Western blot. We 
demonstrated that the LINC00960 expression was increased in PDAC tissues and 
cell lines. Knocking down LINC00960 or IRAK1 could repress the viability, 
migration, and invasion of BxPC-3 and Colo357 cells. LINC00960 functioned as a 
molecular sponge for miR-146a-5p, and IRAK1 was verified as a target gene of 
miR-146a-5p. Additionally, LINC00960 could up-regulate IRAK1 expression via 
repressing miR-146a-5p, and the oncogenic properties of LINC00960 were partly 
reversed by miR-146a-5p. Our findings reveal that LINC00960 is a promoter of

contribute to a variety of cancer-related processes. However, the function of 
IRAK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis has not been investigated 
in detail.
METHODS: IRAK1 expression in HCC was examined by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, 
and Western blot assays. In addition, Huh7 and Hep3B cells were transfected with 
IRAK1 siRNAs and/or a NOD-like receptor family pyrindomain containing 3 (NLRP3) 
plasmid. Western blot, EdU staining, and Transwell assays were performed to 
determine changes of apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC 
cells. Moreover, changes in the expression of proteins involved in the 
MAPKs/NLRP3/IL-1β pathway were confirmed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: IRAK1 was found to be highly upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. 
Knockdown of IRAK1 signaling prevented the proliferation, invasion, migration, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found 
that activation of the MAPKs/NLRP3/IL-1β pathway could be markedly suppressed by 
IRAK1 knockdown in HCC cells. Furthermore, our data showed that NLRP3 could 
partially reverse the reduced aggressive biological behaviors of HCC cells which 
were caused by RAK1 knockdown.
CONCLUSION: Knockdown of IRAK1 prevented HCC progression by inhibiting the 
ability of NLRP3 to block the MAPKs/IL-1β pathway, suggesting that approach as a

contributes to the highest percentage of mortality due to cancer-related deaths 
in women. Paclitaxel (PTX) is heavily relied on as a frontline chemotherapy drug 
in breast cancer treatment, especially in advanced metastatic cancer. Generation 
of resistance to PTX often derails clinical management and adversely affects 
patient outcomes. Understanding the molecular mechanism of PTX resistance is 
necessary to device methods to aid in overcoming the resistance. Recent studies 
exploring the mechanism of development of PTX resistance have led to unveiling 
of a range novel therapeutic targets. PTX resistance pathways that involve major 
regulatory proteins/RNAs like RNF8/Twist/ROR1, TLR, ErbB3/ErbB2, BRCA1- IRIS, 
MENA, LIN9, MiRNA, FoxM1 and IRAK1 have expanded the complexity of resistance 
mechanisms, and brought newer insights into the development of drug targets. 
These resistance-related targets can be dealt with synthetic/natural 
therapeutics in combination with PTX. The present review encompasses the recent 
understanding of PTX resistance mechanisms in breast cancer and possible

brain but still most of the developing nations survive on these diets to 
compensate for the fast-paced lifestyle. The aim of the study is to infer the 
protein-connections behind the liver-brain axis and identify the role of these 
proteins in causing neurodegenerative disorders.
BACKGROUND: Chronic consumption of fructose and fat-rich food works as a toxin 
in the body and has the ability to cause a negative metabolic shift. Recently a 
study was published in Annals of Internal Medicine (2019) citing the loss of 
vision and hearing in a 14-year-old boy whose diet was strictly restricted to 
fries and junk-food for almost a decade. This puts the entire body on insulin 
resistance and related co-morbidities and causes simultaneous damaging effects 
on the liver as well as the brain. This work provides insights into the 
liver-brain axis and explains how the liver is involved in brain related 
disorders.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, transcriptomic data related to chronic eating of 
junk-food was analyzed and simultaneous damage that happens in the liver and the 
brain was assessed at the molecular level.
METHODS: Transcriptomic study was taken from the GEO database and analysed to 
find out the genes dysregulated in both the liver and the brain during this 
metabolic stress. Cytoscapev3.7 was used to decipher the signalling between the 
liver and the brain. This connection between both is called as the liver-brain 
axis.
RESULT: The results obtained from our study indicate the role of 
TUBB5-HYOU1-SDF2L1-DECR1- CDH1-EGFR-SKP2-SOD1-IRAK1-FOXO1 gene signature in the 
decline of concurrent liver and brain health. Dysregulated levels of these genes 
are linked to molecular processes like cellular senescence, hypoxia, glutathione 
synthesis, amino acid modification, increased nitrogen content, synthesis of 
BCAAs, cholesterol biosynthesis, steroid hormone signalling and VEGF pathway.
CONCLUSION: We strongly advocate that prolonged consumption of junk food is a 
major culprit in brain related disorders like Alzheimer's disease and propose 
that receptors for brain diseases lie outside the brain and aiming them for drug 
discovery and design may be beneficial in future clinical studies. This study 
also discusses the connection between NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) 
and sAD (sporadic Alzheimer's disease) owing to liver-brain axis.","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at

cancer cells to paclitaxel (PTX). Materials and Methods: The mRNA expressions of 
miR-146a in normal breast cancer cells, MCF-7, and PTX-resistant breast cancer 
cells, MCF-7/PTX, were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR). MTS was used to analyze the cytotoxicity treated with 
different concentrations of PTX. Overexpressed and silenced cell lines of 
miR-146a and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) were 
constructed, respectively. Cells were treated with PTX and observed the changes 
of cell morphology. Proliferation was detected by clone formation assay. 
Invasion and migration were measured by transwell. RT-PCR was applied to detect 
the expression of IRAK1 gene. Dual luciferase report was performed to validate 
the target relationship between miR-146a and IRAK1. Salvage experiments were 
used to further verify the relationship between miR-146a and IRAK1. Results: PTX 
reduces the viability of MCF-7 and MCF-7/PTX cells in a dose-dependent manner. 
The IC50 of PTX in MCF-7 cells was significantly lower compared with MCF-7/PTX 
cells (p < 0.05). Compared with MCF-7/PTX cells, the expression of miR-146a gene 
in MCF-7 cells was significantly increased, while the expression of IRAK1 gene 
was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Cell proliferation, invasion, and 
migration were decreased after miR-146a overexpression or IRAK1 silencing. 
Whereas, miR-146a silencing and IRAK1 overexpression can increase cell 
proliferation, invasion, and migration ability. Salvage experiments further 
verify that IRAK1 can weaken the role of miR-146a. Conclusion: miR-146a can 
enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to PTX; the mechanism may be 
related to the downregulation of IRAK1.","DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2020.3873

proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle of esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma cells. Methods: The expressions of miR-146a in 3 
esophageal squamous carcinoma cell lines (Eca109, KYSE140, KYSE150) were 
detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). MiR-146a 
mimics was transfected into Eca109 to up-regulate the expression of miR-146a. 
Effects of miR-146a on cell proliferation, invasion and migration were evaluated 
by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), Transwell assay and wound-healing assay, 
respectively. The cell apoptosis and cycle were assessed by flow cytometry 
(FCM). Finally, relevant bioinformatics techniques were used to predict the 
target gene of miR-146a. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the 
interaction of 3' terminal untranslated region (3' UTR) of miR-146a and its 
target gene, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1). RT-qPCR and 
western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expressions of IRAK1, 
respectively. Results: The relative expressions of miR-146a in 3 esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma cells (Eca109, KYSE140, KYSE150) were 0.36±0.05, 
0.16±0.06 and 0.09±0.02, respectively, all of which were significantly lower 
than 1±0.05 of normal esophageal epithelial cells (HEEC) (P<0.01). The model of 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells was constructed by transfecting 
miR-146a mimics into Eca109 cells. The results showed that the ability of 
absorbance value, the number of transmembrane cells (52±18), the reduced scratch 
distances at 48 hours and 72 hours after transfection [(25.29±0.77) μm, 
(30.66±0.91) μm] were significantly lower than those of the negative control 
group and blank control group (all P<0.01). The early apoptosis rate was 
(6.13±0.91)%, higher than (2.50±0.68)% of the negative control group (P<0.01) 
and (1.70±0.20)% of blank control group (P<0.01). The percentage of cells in 
G(1) phase [(44.74±6.76)%] was decreased while the G(2)/M phase [(41.88±2.88)%] 
was increased when compared with the negative control group and the blank 
control group (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). The results of dual luciferase 
reporter gene assay showed that luciferase activity in the group co-transfected 
with IRAK1-wild-type and miR-146a mimics was significantly lower than that in 
the control groups (P<0.01). The results of RT-qPCR and western blot showed that 
the mRNA and protein expressions of IRAK1 in the co-transfected group were 
1.02±0.28 and 1.00±0.05, respectively, both lower than those in the negative 
control group and the blank control group (P<0.01). Conclusions: The expressions 
of miR-146a are decreased in the esophageal squamous cell lines, which plays a 
role as tumor suppressor gene. MiR-146a can inhibit the proliferation, invasion 
and migration of esophageal squamous cell cells, promote apoptosis, and block 
the cell cycle at G(2)/M stage. MiR-146a may mediate the malignant biological 
behavior of esophageal cancer cells through the regulation of IRAK1.","Publisher: 目的： 探讨miR-146a对食管鳞癌细胞增殖、侵袭、迁移、凋亡及细胞周期等生物学行为的影响及其机制。 方法： 
应用实时荧光定量聚合酶链反应(RT-qPCR)技术检测miR-146a在食管鳞癌细胞株Eca109、KYSE140和KYSE150中的表达。将miR-146a模拟物转染Eca109细胞，上调miR-146a的表达，采用细胞增殖实验检测细胞的增殖能力，Transwell实验检测细胞的侵袭能力，划痕实验检测细胞的迁移能力，流式细胞术检测细胞的凋亡和细胞周期。运用相关生物信息学技术预测miR-146a的靶基因，采用双荧光素酶报告基因实验检测miR-146a与靶基因白介素1受体相关激酶1(IRAK1)3′端非翻译区(3′UTR)的结合情况，RT-qPCR技术和Western

by transmission electron microscopy, particle size analysis and protein marker 
detection, and co-cultured with NR8383 cells. The ALI/ARDS model of SD rats was 
established by LPS (10 mg/kg) intratracheal instillation. Following a four-hour 
intratracheal instillation of LPS, 50 μl of RLE-6TN exosomes were injected 
through the tail vein. After that, SAL and miR-146a antagomir were injected into 
the tail vein for 72 h, respectively. As the changes of HE stain, body weight 
and ALI score are observed. The expression of miR-146a, TLR4, NF-kB, IRAK1, 
TRAF6 and their related proteins were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, 
respectively. TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1 β inflammatory factors were detected by 
ELISA. The expression of miR-146a, NF-kB, IRAK, TRAF6 and related inflammatory 
factors in LPS-induced NR8383 was significantly higher than that in the control 
group, while SAL has greatly reduced the expression of TLR4 mediated NF-kB 
inflammatory pathway and related inflammatory factors. SAL can significantly 
improve the LPS-induced lung morphological abnormalities, slowed down the rate 
of weight loss in rats, and reducing the ALI score. The expression trend of 
NF-kB, IRAK, TRAF6 and related inflammatory factors in rats' lung tissues was 
consistent with that in NR8383 cells. SAL has a protective effect on ALI/ARDS 
caused by sepsis, which is likely to be developed to a potential treatment for 
the disease. To sum up, this study provides a new theoretical basis for the 
treatment of ALI/ARDS with SAL.","DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-77448-6

availability of nutrients to the fetus during the final growth stages in utero. 
We investigated how maternal body condition score (BCS) in late pregnancy 
affected calf whole-blood mRNA abundance and IL-1β concentrations after ex vivo 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Thirty-eight multiparous Holstein cows and 
their calves from a larger cohort were retrospectively grouped by prepartal BCS 
as normal BCS (≤3.25; n = 22; NormBCS) and high BCS (≥3.75; n = 16; HighBCS). 
Calf blood samples collected at birth (before receiving colostrum, d 0) and at 
ages 21 and 42 d (at weaning) were used for ex vivo whole-blood challenge with 3 
µg/mL of LPS before mRNA isolation. Target genes evaluated by real-time 
quantitative PCR were associated with immune response, antioxidant function, and 
1-carbon metabolism. Plasma IL-1β concentrations were also measured. Responses 
in plasma IL-1β and mRNA abundance were compared between LPS-challenged and 
nonchallenged samples. Statistical analyses were performed at all time points 
using a MIXED model in SAS 9.4. Neither birth body weight (NormBCS = 43.8 ± 1.01 
kg; HighBCS = 43.9 ± 1.2 kg) nor colostrum IgG concentration (NormBCS = 70 ± 5.4 
mg/mL; HighBCS = 62 ± 6.5 mg/mL) differed between groups. At birth, whole blood 
from calves born to HighBCS cows had greater mRNA abundance of IL1B, NFKB1, and 
GSR and lower GPX1 and CBS abundance after LPS challenge. The longitudinal 
analysis of d 0, 21, and 42 data revealed a BCS × age effect for SOD2 and NOS2 
due to lower mRNA abundance at 42 d in the HighBCS calves. Regardless of 
maternal BCS, mRNA abundance decreased over time for genes encoding cytokines 
(IL1B, IL6, IL10, TNF), cytokine receptors (IRAK1, CXCR1), toll-like receptor 
pathway (TLR4, NFKB1), adhesion and migration (CADM1, ICAM1, ITGAM), and 
antimicrobial function (MPO). Concentration of IL-1β after LPS challenge was 
also markedly lower at 21 d regardless of maternal BCS. Overall, results 
suggested that maternal BCS in late prepartum influences the calf immune system 
response to an inflammation challenge after birth. Although few genes among 
those studied were altered due to maternal BCS, the fact that genes related to 
oxidative stress and 1-carbon metabolism responded to LPS challenge in HighBCS 
calves underscores the potential role of methyl donors (e.g., methionine, 
choline, and folic acid) in the early-life innate immune response.","Copyright © 2021 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

milestone, being considered the main native species produced in South American 
continental waters. Despite the importance of this fish, its immunity is not 
well understood. In this study we established some patterns of innate immunity 
for the species via two experiments. Both studies evaluated the fish in the 
absence (intraperitoneal saline) or presence (intraperitoneal, 3 x 107 CFU/mL of 
Aeromonas hydrophila at 0.1 mL/10 g of living weight) of infection at 5 points 
over time-course of 14 days (0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 7 d, 14 d). In the first 
experiment, the partial gene sequences and gene expression of IL-1β, IRAK-1, C3, 
C4, lysozyme, IL-10, HSP70 and β-actin were determined in the main secondary 
lymphoid organs of fish: the spleen and head kidney. The second study was 
performed to analyse the alternative complement pathway ACH50 in serum to 
support the elucidation of C3 gene expression. Results of the gene expression 
assays showed a tendency towards up-regulation of immune genes in infected fish 
in early phases of infection (mostly around 6 h and 24 h) and in the chronic 
phase (7 d and 14 d), with the exception of HSP70 which showed a down-regulation 
in infected fish. Our results also suggested that lysozyme was evolved in both 
pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. For genes of the complement system, it 
was demonstrated that C4 regulation followed the tendency of pro-inflammatory 
genes. However, the C3 gene was, surprisingly, not expressed in most fish and 
this corroborated with the results of the complement system activity in serum 
that also did not show activity in most fish. The possible reasons for the 
regulation of gene expression and association with fish disease are addressed in

immune signaling that mediate the host response to pathogens. In contrast to the 
active kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4, IRAK2 and IRAK3 are pseudokinases lacking 
catalytic activity and their functions are poorly understood. IRAK3 is thought 
to be a negative regulator of innate immune signaling and mutations in IRAK3 are 
associated with asthma and cancer. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 
human IRAK3 pseudokinase domain in a closed, pseudoactive conformation. IRAK3 
dimerizes in a unique way through a head-to-head arrangement not observed in any 
other kinases. Multiple conserved cysteine residues imply a potential redox 
control of IRAK3 conformation and dimerization. By analyzing asthma-associated 
mutations, we identify an evolutionarily conserved surface on IRAK3 that could 
form an interaction interface with IRAK4, suggesting a model for the negative

inhibitor, in patients with advanced myelofibrosis who are intolerant of or 
resistant to ruxolitinib. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to pacritinib 100 mg 
once per day, 100 mg twice per day, or 200 mg twice per day. Enhanced 
eligibility criteria, monitoring, and dose modifications were implemented to 
mitigate risk of cardiac and hemorrhagic events. Efficacy was based on ≥35% 
spleen volume response (SVR) and ≥50% reduction in the 7-component total symptom 
score (TSS) through week 24. Of 161 patients, 73% were intolerant of and 76% had 
become resistant to ruxolitinib; 50% met criteria for both. Severe 
thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 × 103/μL) was present in 44%. SVR rates 
were highest with 200 mg twice per day (100 mg once per day, 0%; 100 mg twice 
per day, 1.8%; 200 mg twice per day, 9.3%), particularly among patients with 
baseline platelet counts <50 × 103/μL (17%; 4 of 24). Although TSS response rate 
was similar across doses (100 mg once per day, 7.7%; 100 mg twice per day, 7.3%; 
200 mg twice per day, 7.4%), median percent reduction in TSS suggested a 
dose-response relationship (-3%, -16%, and -27%, respectively). Pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic modeling based on all available data showed greatest SVR and 
TSS reduction at 200 mg twice per day compared with lower doses. Common adverse 
events were gastrointestinal events, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. There was no 
excess of grade ≥3 hemorrhagic or cardiac events at 200 mg twice per day. 
Pacritinib 200 mg twice per day demonstrated clinical activity and an acceptable

in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) show good clinical response to 
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), patients eventually develop acquired 
resistance. Previous studies have shown that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are 
involved in EGFR TKI resistance. Here, we aimed to investigate whether 
miR-146b-5p sensitizes the EGFR TKI-resistant lung cancer cells. Clinical 
analysis showed that miR-146b-5p expression in lung cancer cells isolated from 
pleural effusions of treatment-naive patients was significantly higher than that 
after acquiring resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. Ectopic expression of 
miR-146b-5p in EGFR TKI-resistant cells enhanced EGFR TKI-induced apoptosis. The 
same results were observed in EGFR-dependent and -independent 
osimertinib-resistant primary cancer cells (PE3479 and PE2988). Mechanically, 
miR-146b-5p suppressed nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity and NF-κB-related IL-6 
and IL-8 production by targeting IRAK1. A negative correlation was observed 
between miR-146b-5p and IRAK1 in clinical specimens. In rescue experiments, 
restoration of IRAK1 expression reversed the effects of miR-146b-5p on EGFR TKI 
sensitivity and recovered NF-κB-regulated IL-6 and IL-8 production. In 
conclusion, miR-146b-5p/IRAK1/NF-κB signaling is important in promoting EGFR TKI

mortality. Cardiac miR-146a is emerging as a potent regulator of myocardial 
function. Dexmedetomidine preconditioning provides cardioprotective effects, of 
which mechanisms related to miR-146a-3p are unclear.
METHODS: A myocardial I/R model in rats and a cellular anoxia/reoxygenation 
(A/R) model in H9C2 cells were established and preconditioned with 
dexmedetomidine or not. H9C2 cells were transfected with mimics, inhibitor, or 
negative controls of miR-146a-3p, and siRNAs of IRAK1 or TRAF6. Relative 
expressions of miR-146a-3p were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction. The apoptosis rates and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in 
H9C2 cells were examined by flow cytometry. Protein expressions of IRAK1, TRAF6, 
cleaved Caspase-3, BAX, BCL-2, NF-κB p65, phosphorylated NF-κB p65 (p-NF-κB 
p65), IκBα, and phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα) in H9C2 cells were detected by 
Western blot.
RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine decreased myocardial infarction size and apoptosis 
rates of H9C2 cells. Dexmedetomidine upregulated expression of miR-146a-3p. 
Dexmedetomidine significantly decreased protein expressions of IRAK1, TRAF6, 
cleaved Caspase-3, BAX, and NF-κB p65, but increased expressions of BCL-2 in 
H9C2 cells. miR-146a-3p overexpression strengthened the anti-apoptotic effect 
induced by dexmedetomidine in H9C2 cells via decreasing protein levels of IRAK1, 
TRAF6, cleaved Caspase-3, BAX, NF-κB p65, p-NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα and increasing 
protein level of BCL-2. Downregulation of miR-146a-3p reversed the changes in 
these proteins in H9C2 cells. Expressions of NF-κB p65 and p-NF-κB p65 were 
further decreased following knockdown of IRAK1 or TRAF6. ROS emission was 
significantly increased after A/R, while significantly decreased following 
dexmedetomidine preconditioning in H9C2 cells transfected with siIRAK1 or 
siTRAF6.
CONCLUSION: miR-146a-3p targeting IRAK1 and TRAF6 through inhibition of NF-κB 
signaling pathway and ROS emission is involved in cardioprotection induced by 
dexmedetomidine pretreatment.","Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.. All rights

mediators in the signaling pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)/IL1Rs. 
Targeting the IRAK4/IRAK1/TRAF6 axis and its associated pathway has therapeutic 
benefits in liver fibrosis. However, the function of IRAK1 itself in the 
development of liver fibrosis remains unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS Irak1 global 
knockout (KO) mice were generated to study the functional role of Irak1 in liver 
fibrosis. Male Irak1 knockout and control mice were challenged with chronic 
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or fed a methionine- and choline-deficient diet 
(MCDD) to generate models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Liver 
inflammation and collagen deposition were assessed by histological examination, 
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting of hepatic tissues. 
RESULTS The mRNA expression of the downstream inflammatory gene Il1b was 
significantly lower in Irak1-KO than in control mice. Irak1 ablation had little 
effect on inflammatory cell infiltration into livers of mice with NASH. Collagen 
deposition and the expression of genes related to fibrogenesis were similar in 
the livers of Irak1-KO and control mice exposed to CCl4 and MCDD. The loss of 
Irak1 did not affect lipid or glucose metabolism in these experimental models of 
steatohepatitis. CONCLUSIONS Irak1 knockout reduced the expression of 
inflammatory genes but had no effect on hepatic fibrogenesis. The Irak1-related 
pathway may regulate liver fibrosis via other pathways or be compensated for by 
other factors.","DOI: 10.12659/MSM.926187

recruitment of new host cells for population expansion, and delayed apoptosis 
are associated with prolonged nuclear presence of NF-κB. We investigated NF-κB 
signaling and transcriptional activity with A. phagocytophilum infection using 
inhibitors of NF-κB signaling pathways, and through silencing of signaling 
pathway genes. How inhibitors or silencing affected A. phagocytophilum growth, 
inflammatory response (transcription of the κB-enhanced genes CXCL8 and MMP9), 
and NF-κB signaling pathway gene expression were tested. Among A. 
phagocytophilum-infected HL-60 cells, nuclear NF-κB p50, p65, and p52 were 
detected by immunoblots or iTRAQ proteomics. A. phagocytophilum growth was 
affected most by the IKKαβ inhibitor wedelolactone (reductions of 96 to 99%) as 
compared with SC-514 that selectively inhibits IKKβ, illustrating a role for the 
non-canonical pathway. Wedelolactone inhibited transcription of both CXCL8 (p = 
0.001) and MMP9 (p = 0.002) in infected cells. Compared to uninfected THP-1 
cells, A. phagocytophilum infection led to >2-fold down regulation of 64 of 92 
NF-κB signaling pathway genes, and >2-fold increased expression in only 4. 
Wedelolactone and SC-514 reversed downregulation in all 64 and 45, respectively, 
of the genes down-regulated by infection, but decreased expression in 1 gene 
with SC-514 only. Silencing of 20 NF-κB signal pathway genes increased bacterial 
growth in 12 (IRAK1, MAP3K1, NFKB1B, MAP3K7, TICAM2, TLR3, TRADD, TRAF3, CHUK, 
IRAK2, LTBR, and MALT1). Most findings support canonical pathway activation; 
however, the presence of NFKB2 in infected cell nuclei, selective non-canonical 
pathway inhibitors that dampen CXCL8 and MMP9 transcription with infection, 
upregulation of non-canonical pathway target genes CCL13 and CCL19, enhanced 
bacterial growth with TRAF3 and LTBR silencing provide evidence for 
non-canonical pathway signaling. Whether this impacts distinct inflammatory 
processes that underlie disease, and whether and how A. phagocytophilum subverts 
NF-κB signaling via these pathways, need to be investigated.","Copyright © 2020 Dumler, Lichay, Chen, Rennoll-Bankert and Park.","DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2020.558283

microRNAs (miRs), which may play important roles in mediating inflammatory 
responses. The present study attempts to investigate the roles of miR-146a-5p in 
regulating cytokine expression in a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). 
Four types of PM2.5 extracts obtained from Beijing, China, were subjected to 
cytotoxic tests in THP-1 cells. These four PM2.5 extracts included two water 
extracts collected from non-heating and heating season (WN and WH), and two 
organic extracts from non-heating and heating season (DN and DH). Firstly, the 
four PM2.5 extracts caused cytotoxicity, oxidative stress responses, cytokine 
gene expressions and interleukin 8 (IL-8) release in THP-1 cells, with WH 
showing the highest cytotoxicity, WN showing the highest oxidative stress and 
inflammatory responses. Additionally, we observed expression of miR-146a-5p was 
significantly increased, with the maximal response of six folds in WN group. 
Cellular autophagy was initiated by PM2.5 indicated by related protein and gene 
expressions. Both RNA interference and autophagy inhibitor were applied to 
interrupt autophagy process in THP-1 cells. Autophagy dysfunction could 
alleviate IL-8 expression, suggesting autophagy process regulated cytokine 
expression and inflammatory response caused by PM2.5. A chemical inhibitor was 
applied to inhibit the function of miR-146a-5p, and then the expressions of IL-8 
and autophagic genes were significantly aggravated. Meanwhile, two target genes 
of miR-146a-5p, interleukin-1 associated-kinase-1 (IRAK1) and tumor-necrosis 
factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) were increased dramatically, which 
also played important roles in regulation of autophagy. These data suggested 
miR-146a-5p negatively modulated cytokine expression caused by PM2.5 via 
autophagy process through the target genes of IRAK1 and TRAF6. Our findings 
raised the concerns of the changes of miR expression profile and following

melanomagenesis. Genomewide studies showed that the expression of Aurora -A and 
-B significantly has been upregulated in melanoma. However, there is no FDA 
approved drug targeting aurora kinases in the treatment of melanoma. In 
addition, the development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in the 
treatment of melanoma and, as a result, the relapse due to heterogeneous cell 
groups in patients is a second phenomenon that causes treatment failure. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for therapeutic alternatives targeting both 
melanoma and Melanoma Cancer Stem Cells (MCSCs) in treatments. At this stage, 
cell cycle regulators become promising targets.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to identify the effects of Aurora kinase 
inhibitor CCT137690 on the cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and 
colony formation and expression changes of genes related to proliferation, cell 
death and cell cycle in melanoma and melanoma cancer stem cell. In addition, we 
investigated the apoptotic and cytostatic effects of CCT137690 in normal 
fibroblast cells.
METHODS: We evaluated the cytotoxic effect of CCT137690 in MCSCs, NM2C5 
referring as melanoma model cells and WI-38 cells by using the WST-1 test. The 
effect of CCT137690 on apoptosis was detected via Annexin V and JC-1 method; on 
cell cycle progression by cell cycle test; on gene expression by using RT-PCR, 
on migration activity by wound healing assay and clonal growth by clonogenic 
assay in NM2C5 cells and MCSCs. The effects of CCT137690 in WI-38, referring as 
healthy fibroblast cell, were assessed through Annexin V and cell cycle method.
RESULTS: CCT137690 was determined to have a cytotoxic and apoptotic effect in 
MCSCs and melanoma. It caused polyploidy and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase 
in MCSCs and melanoma cells. The significant decrease in the expression of MMP2, 
MMP7, MMP10, CCNB1, IRAK1, PLK2 genes, and the increase in the expression of 
PTEN, CASP7, p53 genes were detected.
CONCLUSION: Aurora kinases inhibitor CCT137690 displays promising anticancer 
activity in melanoma and especially melanoma cancer stem cells. The effect of 
CCT137690 on melanoma and MCSC may provide a new approach to treatment 
protocols.","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at

killing more people than any other single infectious agent and causing 
uncontrollable inflammation in the host. Poorly controlled inflammatory 
processes can be deleterious and result in immune exhaustion. The current 
tuberculosis (TB) control is facing the challenge of drugs deficiency, 
especially in the context of increasingly multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. Under 
this circumstance, alternative host-directed therapy (HDT) emerges timely which 
can be exploited to improve the efficacy of TB treatment and disease prognosis 
by targeting the host. Here, we established the in vitro infection model of Mtb 
macrophages with H37Ra strain to seek effective anti-TB active agent. The 
present study showed that Guttiferone K, isolated from Garcinia yunnanensis, 
could significantly inhibit Mtb-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 and primary 
peritoneal macrophages. It was evidenced by the decreased production of 
inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), 
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Further studies with immunoblotting and 
immunofluorescence revealed that Guttiferone K obviously inhibits the nuclear 
factor-kappa B (NF-κB) both in RAW264.7 and primary peritoneal macrophages 
relying on the TLR/IRAK-1 pathway. Guttiferone K could also suppress the NLRP3 
inflammasome activity and induce autophagy by inhibiting the protein kinase B 
(p-Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation at Ser473 and 
Ser2448 in both cell lines. Thus, Guttiferone K possesses significant 
anti-inflammatory effect, alleviating Mtb-induced inflammation with an 
underlying mechanism that targeting on the TLR/IRAK-1 pathway and inhibiting the 
downstream NF-κB and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Together, Guttiferone K can be 
an anti-inflammatory agent candidate for the design of new adjunct HDT drugs

well-documented, and hence, several synthetic ligands of TLR3 are being used for 
adjuvant therapy, but there are reports showing a contradictory effect of TLR3 
signaling, which include our previous report that had shown cell proliferation 
following surface localization of TLR 3. However, the underlying mechanism of 
cell surface localization of TLR3 and subsequent cell proliferation lacks 
clarity. This study addresses the TLR3 ligand-mediated signaling cascade that 
regulates a proliferative effect in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and T47D) 
challenged with TLR3 ligand in the presence of myeloid differentiation primary 
response 88 (MyD88) inhibitor. Evidences were obtained using immunoblotting, 
coimmunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, and flow 
cytometry. Results had revealed that TLR3 ligand treatment significantly 
enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation marked by an upregulated expression of 
cyclinD1, but the same was suppressed by the addition of MyD88 inhibitor. Also, 
expression of interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1)-TNF 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-transforming growth factor beta-activated 
kinase 1 (TAK1) was altered in the given TLR3-signaling pathway. Inhibition of 
MyD88 disrupted the downstream adaptor complex and mediated signaling through 
the TLR3-MyD88-NF-κB (p65)-IL-6-cyclin D1 pathway. TLR3-mediated alternative 
signaling of the TLR3-MyD88-IRAK1-TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-NF-κB axis leads to 
upregulation of IL6 and cyclin D1. This response is hypothesized to be via the 
MyD88 gateway that culminates in the proliferation of breast cancer cells. 
Overall, this study provides first comprehensive evidence on the involvement of 
canonical signaling of TLR3 using MyD88-cyclin D1-mediated breast cancer cell 
proliferation. The findings elucidated herein will provide valuable insights 
into understanding the TLR3-mediated adjuvant therapy in cancer.","Copyright © 2020 Singh, Devkar and Basu.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01780

squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being the most frequent histological type around 
the world. Growing evidence has shown that the abnormal expression of microRNAs 
(miRNAs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is closely related to the 
pathogenesis of cancers. MiR-146a is a crucial regulator of inflammatory 
cascades. There is currently no data available regarding the possible role of 
miR-146a in PBMCs of ESCC patients. We evaluated the expression of miR-146a, as 
well as its target genes (IRAK1 and TRAF6) and its associated immune effectors 
(NF-κB1, IL1B, and IL6) in PBMCs of 40 ESCC patients and 50 control subjects. 
The geometric mean expression of five transcripts was used for normalizing 
expressions. The PBMC level of miR-146a, as measured by RT-qPCR, was 
upregulated, whereas levels of its target genes, IRAK1 and TRAF6, were 
downregulated in ESCC patients. NF-κB1 and IL6 was downregulated in PBMCs of 
ESCC patients. There was no difference in terms of the IL1B level between 
patients and the control group. Logistic regression and receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis suggested that a model with PBMC levels of either 
NF-κB1+ IL6 or NF-κB1+ miR-146a as predictors may discriminate ESCC patients 
from subjects of the control group. Our findings, in the context of the current 
literature, may suggest a possible downregulatory mechanism of immune responses 
in PBMCs of ESCC patients.","DOI: 10.1080/08820139.2020.1828454

post-transcriptional gene expression and contribute to all aspects of cellular 
function. We previously reported that the activities of several 
mitochondria-enriched miRNAs regulating inflammation (i.e., miR-142-3p, 
miR-142-5p, and miR-146a) are altered in the hippocampus at 3-12 hours following 
a severe traumatic brain injury. In the present study, we investigated the 
temporal expression profile of these inflammatory miRNAs in mitochondria and 
cytosol fractions at more chronic post-injury times following severe controlled 
cortical impact injury in rats. In addition, several inflammatory genes were 
analyzed in the cytosol fractions. The analysis showed that while elevated 
levels were observed in cytoplasm, the mitochondria-enriched miRNAs, miR-142-3p 
and miR-142-5p continued to be significantly reduced in mitochondria from 
injured hippocampi for at least 3 days and returned to near normal levels at 7 
days post-injury. Although not statistically significant, miR-146a also remained 
at reduced levels for up to 3 days following controlled cortical impact injury, 
and recovered by 7 days. In contrast, miRNAs that are not enriched in 
mitochondria, including miR-124a, miR-150, miR-19b, miR-155, and miR-223 were 
either increased or demonstrated no change in their levels in mitochondrial 
fractions for 7 days. The one exception was that miR-223 levels were reduced in 
mitochondria at 1 day following injury. No major alterations were observed in 
sham operated animals. This temporal pattern was unique to mitochondria-enriched 
miRNAs and correlated with injury-induced changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics 
as well as expression levels of several inflammatory markers. These observations 
suggested a potential compartmental re-distribution of the mitochondria-enriched 
inflammatory miRNAs and may reflect an intracellular mechanism by which specific 
miRNAs regulate injury-induced inflammatory signaling. To test this, we utilized 
a novel peptide-based nanoparticle strategy for in vitro and in vivo delivery of 
a miR-146a mimic as a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting nuclear 
factor-kappaB inflammatory modulators in the injured brain. Nanoparticle 
delivery of miR-146a to BV-2 or SH-SY5Y cells significantly reduced expression 
of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), two important modulators of the nuclear 
factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pro-inflammatory pathway. Moreover, injections of miR-146a 
containing nanoparticles into the brain immediately following controlled 
cortical impact injury significantly reduced hippocampal TNF receptor-associated 
factor 6 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 levels. Taken together, 
our studies demonstrate the subcellular alteration of inflammatory miRNAs after 
traumatic brain injury and establish proof of principle that nanoparticle 
delivery of miR-146a has therapeutic potential for modulating pro-inflammatory 
effectors in the injured brain. All of the studies performed were approved by

heat stress (HS). Methyl donor supply-methionine (Met) and choline 
(Chol)-positively modulates innate immune function, particularly antioxidant 
systems of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The objective of this study was 
to investigate the effect of Met and Chol supply in vitro on mRNA abundance of 
genes related to 1-carbon metabolism, inflammation, and immune function in 
short-term cultures of PMN isolated from mid-lactating Holstein cows in response 
to heat challenge. Blood PMN were isolated from 5 Holstein cows (153 ± 5 d 
postpartum, 34.63 ± 2.73 kg/d of milk production; mean ± SD). The PMN were 
incubated for 2 h at thermal-neutral (37°C; TN) or heat stress (42°C; HS) 
temperatures with 3 levels of Chol (0, 400, or 800 μg/mL) or 3 ratios of Lys:Met 
(Met; 3.6:1, 2.9:1, or 2.4:1). Supernatant concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, and 
tumor necrosis factor-α were measured via bovine-specific ELISA. Fold-changes in 
mRNA abundance were calculated separately for Chol and Met treatments to obtain 
the fold-change response at 42°C (HS) relative to 37°C (TN). Data were subjected 
to ANOVA using PROC MIXED in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Orthogonal 
contrasts were used to determine the linear or quadratic effect of Met and Chol 
for mRNA fold-change and supernatant cytokine concentrations. Compared with PMN 
receiving 0 μg of Chol/mL, heat-stressed PMN supplemented with Chol at 400 or 
800 μg/mL had greater fold-change in abundance of CBS, CSAD, GSS, GSR, and GPX1. 
Among genes associated with inflammation and immune function, fold-change in 
abundance of TLR2, TLR4, IRAK1, IL1B, and IL10 increased with 400 and 800 μg of 
Chol/mL compared with PMN receiving 0 μg of Chol/mL. Fold-change in abundance of 
SAHH decreased linearly at increasing levels of Met supply. A linear effect was 
detected for MPO, NFKB1, and SOD1 due to greater fold-change in abundance when 
Met was increased to reach Lys:Met ratios of 2.9:1 and 2.4:1. Although 
increasing Chol supply upregulated BAX, BCL2, and HSP70, increased Met supply 
only upregulated BAX. Under HS conditions, enhancing PMN supply of Chol to 400 
μg/mL effectively increased fold-change in abundance of genes involved in 
antioxidant production (conferring cellular processes protection from free 
radicals and reactive oxygen species), inflammatory signaling, and innate 
immunity. Although similar outcomes were obtained with Met supply at Lys:Met 
ratios of 2.9:1 and 2.4:1, the response was less pronounced. Both Chol and Met 
supply enhanced the cytoprotective characteristics of PMN through upregulation 
of heat shock proteins. Overall, the modulatory effects detected in the present 
experiment highlight an opportunity to use Met and particularly Chol 
supplementation during thermal stress.","The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. and Fass Inc. on behalf of the American

messengers with key roles in normal and pathological processes. Our previous 
work had demonstrated that Dsg2 expression in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
cells enhanced both sEV secretion and loading of pro-mitogenic cargo. In this 
study, using wild-type Dsg2 and a mutant form that is unable to be palmitoylated 
(Dsg2cacs), we investigated the mechanism by which Dsg2 modulates SCC tumour 
development and progression through sEVs. We demonstrate that palmitoylation was 
required for Dsg2 to regulate sub-cellular localisation of lipid raft and 
endosomal proteins necessary for sEV biogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of 
the endosomal pathway abrogated Dsg2-mediated sEV release. In murine xenograft 
models, Dsg2-expressing cells generated larger xenograft tumours as compared to 
cells expressing GFP or Dsg2cacs. Co-treatment with sEVs derived from 
Dsg2-over-expressing cells increased xenograft size. Cytokine profiling 
revealed, Dsg2 enhanced both soluble and sEV-associated IL-8 and miRNA profiling 
revealed, Dsg2 down-regulated both cellular and sEV-loaded miR-146a. miR-146a 
targets IRAK1, a serine-threonine kinase involved in IL-8 signalling. Treatment 
with a miR-146a inhibitor up-regulated both IRAK1 and IL-8 expression. RNAseq 
analysis of HNSCC tumours revealed a correlation between Dsg2 and IL-8. Finally, 
elevated IL-8 plasma levels were detected in a subset of HNSCC patients who did 
not respond to immune checkpoint therapy, suggesting that these patients may 
benefit from prior anti-IL-8 treatment. In summary, these results suggest that 
intercellular communication through cell-cell adhesion, cytokine release and 
secretion of EVs are coordinated, and critical for tumour growth and 
development, and may serve as potential prognostic markers to inform treatment 
options.

cell-derived neoplasm with an unfavorable prognosis. The oncocytic variant of 
PDTC may be associated with even more adverse outcome than classical PDTC cases, 
but its specific molecular features are largely unknown. Our aim was to explore 
the immune-related gene expression profile of oncocytic and classical PDTC, in 
correlation with clinical and pathological characteristics (including programmed 
death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression) and outcome, and in comparison with a control 
group of well-differentiated follicular carcinomas (WDFCs), including 
conventional follicular carcinomas (FTCs) and Hürthle cell carcinomas (HCCs).
METHODS: A retrospective series of 48 PDTCs and 24 WDFCs was analyzed by means 
of NanoString technology employing the nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling 
panel. Gene expression data were validated using quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Oncocytic PDTCs showed a specific immune-related gene expression 
profile, with higher expression of LAIR2, CD274, DEFB1, IRAK1, CAMP, LCN2, LY96, 
and APOE, and lower expression of NOD1, as compared to conventional PDTCs. This 
molecular signature was associated with increased intratumoral lymphocytic 
infiltration, PD-L1 expression, and adverse outcome. Three of these genes, 
CD274, DEFB1, and IRAK1, as well as PD-L1 expression, were also the hallmarks of 
HCCs as compared to FTCs. By contrast, the panel of genes differentially 
regulated in PDTCs as compared to WDFCs was unrelated to the oncocytic 
phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed a distinctive immune-related gene expression 
profile of oncocytic PDTC and confirmed a more aggressive outcome in this cancer 
subtype. These findings may provide guidance when exploring novel 
immunotherapeutic options for oncocytic PDTC patients.","© Endocrine Society 2020. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail:

Tianjin, China.","OBJECTIVE: Dry eye syndrome in which tear fluid quality or abnormality, or 
kinetic abnormality is caused by various reasons, resulting in decreased tear 
film stability. In recent years, more and more results from the studies indicate 
that miRNA alterations are involved in dry eye syndrome. And miRNA-146a-5p is a 
key regulator to regulate the inflammatory response. In this paper, we 
demonstrated whether miRNA-146a-5p could cure dry eye syndrome by regulating 
target genes based on network analysis.
METHODS: In current study, we collected the blood of patients with dry eye 
disease served as a model group; the blood of healthy people was served as 
control group. The expression of miRNA-146a-5p in the patients was detected by 
RT-PCR, the genes controlled by miRNA-146a-5p were predicted by TargetScan, 
miRDB, miRWalk, and PicTar databases, and the genes regulated by miRNA-146a-5p 
which relative with dry eye disease were selected by drawing Venn diagram.
RESULTS: The comparison of the general information between patients and healthy 
people was no significant difference, and it indicated that the two groups were 
comparable. The results of databases showed that IRAK1 was one of the target 
genes regulated by miRNA-146a-5p, and it is related to dry eye disease. The 
expression of miRNA-146a-5p was negatively related to IRAK1 mRNA and protein, 
while IRAK1 had a positive correlation with IL-6, TNF-α, and CBP proteins.
CONCLUSION: These results emphasized that miRNA-146a-5p could inhibit the 
expression of IRAK1, IL-6, TNF-α, and CBP to help reduce the inflammatory 
response in dry eye syndrome.","© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis Published by Wiley

and one of their main functions is to regulate the immune responses. 
Gram-positive bacterium, Streptococcus parauberis is the main causative agent of 
""Streptococcosis"" in wide range of fish species. In this study, we performed 
high throughput sequencing analysis to identify the miRNA profile against S. 
parauberis infection in the spleen of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Overall, 349 
known and 151 novel miRNAs were discovered. Among them, 12 known miRNAs 
(dre-miR-34b, dre-miR-135a, dre-miR-200b-5p, dre-miR-146b, dre-miR-31, 
dre-miR-17a-3p, dre-miR-222a-3p, dre-miR-731, dre-miR-301b-3p and 
dre-miR-30a-3p) and 9 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) in the 
spleen of S. parauberis challenged zebrafish. The identified 12 DE miRNAs were 
predicted to regulate 721 target genes. We confirmed the miRNA expression 
results by validating selected known and novel DE miRNAs using qRT-PCR. Gene 
Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) pathway analysis and 
miRNA-mRNA interactions implies that specific target genes of DE miRNAs are 
associated with immune responses. The enriched pathways included Toll-like 
receptor (TLR), C-type lectin, NOD-like receptor, and RIG-I-like receptor

is to evaluate the contribution of TLR-related gene expression and miRNA

injury (AKI) that is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and for which 
specific treatments are lacking. In this study, we investigated the protective 
effect of human urine-derived stem cells (USCs) and their exosomes against 
IRI-induced AKI to explore the potential of these cells as a new therapeutic 
strategy. Methods: USCs were derived from fresh human urine. Cell surface marker 
expression was analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the characteristics of 
the stem cells. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to generate a lethal 
renal IRI model. One dose of USCs (2×106 cells/ml) or exosomes (20 µg/1 ml) in 
the experimental groups or saline (1 ml) in the control group was administered 
intravenously immediately after blood reperfusion. Blood was drawn every other 
day for measurement of serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 
levels. The kidneys were harvested for RNA and protein extraction to examine the 
levels of apoptosis and tubule injury. In vitro, the hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) 
model in human kidney cortex/proximal tubule cells (HK2) was used to analyze the 
protective ability of USC-derived exosomes (USC-Exo). Quantitative 
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting, 
superoxide dismutase activity, and malonaldehyde content analyses were used to 
evaluate oxidative stress in HK2 cells treated with USC-Exo after H/R. Exosomal 
microRNA sequencing techniques and bioinformatics analysis were used to search 
for enriched miRNAs in the exosomes and interacting genes. The interaction 
between miRNAs and the 3' untranslated region of the target gene was detected 
using a dual luciferase reporting system. The miRNA mimic and inhibitor were 
used to regulate the miRNA level in HK2 cells. Results: Treatment with USCs led 
to reductions in the levels of sCr, BUN, and renal tubular cell apoptosis; 
inhibited the infiltration of inflammatory cells; and protected renal function 
in the rat IRI model. Additionally, USC-derived exosomes protected against 
IRI-induced renal damage. miR-146a-5p was the most abundant miRNA in exosomes 
obtained from the conditioned medium (CM) of USCs. miR-146a-5p targeted and 
degraded the 3'UTR of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) mRNA, 
subsequently inhibited the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling, and 
protected HK2 cells from H/R injury. USC transplantation also upregulated 
miR-146a-5p expression, downregulated IRAK1 expression and inhibited nuclear 
translocation of NF-κB p65 in the kidney of the rat IRI model. Conclusions: 
According to our experimental results, USCs could protect against renal IRI via 
exosomal miR-146a-5p, which could target the 3'UTR of IRAK1 and subsequently 
inhibit the activation of NF-κB signaling and infiltration of inflammatory cells 
to protect renal function. As a novel cell source, USCs represent a promising 
non-invasive approach for the treatment of IRI.",© The author(s).,"DOI: 10.7150/thno.42153

(#)Contributed equally","Fibrotic remodeling is an adverse consequence of immune response-driven 
phenotypic modulation of cardiac cells following myocardial infarction (MI). 
MicroRNA-146b (miR-146b) is an active regulator of immunomodulation, but its 
function in the cardiac inflammatory cascade and its clinical implication in 
fibrotic remodeling following MI remain largely unknown. Herein, miR-146b-5p was 
found to be upregulated in the infarcted myocardium of mice and the serum of 
myocardial ischemia patients. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments 
demonstrated that miR-146b-5p was a hypoxia-induced regulator that governed the 
pro-fibrotic phenotype transition of cardiac cells. Overexpression of 
miR-146b-5p activated fibroblast proliferation, migration, and 
fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, impaired endothelial cell function and 
stress survival, and disturbed macrophage paracrine signaling. Interestingly, 
the opposite effects were observed when miR-146b-5p expression was inhibited. 
Luciferase assays and rescue studies demonstrated that the miR-146b-5p target 
genes mediating the above phenotypic modulations included interleukin 1 receptor 
associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion 
molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Local delivery of a miR-146b-5p antagomir significantly 
reduced fibrosis and cell death, and upregulated capillary and reparative 
macrophages in the infarcted myocardium to restore cardiac remodeling and 
function in both mouse and porcine MI models. Local inhibition of miR-146b-5p 
may represent a novel therapeutic approach to treat cardiac fibrotic remodeling

with high mortality, and the effective therapies for ICH remain to be explored. 
Exosomes (Exos) have been found to play important roles in cell communication by 
transferring molecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs). MiRNAs are critical 
regulators of genes involved in many various biological processes and have been 
demonstrated to aggravate or alleviate brain damages induced by ICH. The aim of 
the present study was to investigate the effect of Exos derived from 
miR-146a-5p-enriched bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs-miR-146a-5p-Exos) 
on experimental ICH.
METHODS: ICH was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by an intrastriatal 
injection of collagenase type IV. At 24 h after surgery, Exos were 
administrated. For detecting apoptotic cells, TUNEL staining was performed using 
an in situ Cell Death Detection Kit. Fluoro-Jade B staining was performed to 
detect degenerating neurons. Immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect 
the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and OX-42. The binding of miR-146a-5p 
and its target genes was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: At 24 h after surgery, BMSCs-miR-146a-5p-Exos administration 
significantly improved neurological function, reduced apoptotic and degenerative 
neurons, and inhibited inflammatory response. Furthermore, miR-146a-5p-enriched 
Exos obviously inhibited the M1 polarization of microglia after ICH in rats, 
accompanied by the reduced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators releasing by 
M1 microglia including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Finally, we observed 
that miR-146a-5p directly targeted interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase1 
(IRAK1) and nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5), which contributed to 
the inflammation response and the polarization of M1 microglia/macrophages.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that miR-146a-5p-riched BMSCs-Exos could offer 
neuroprotection and functional improvements after ICH through reducing neuronal 
apoptosis, and inflammation associated with the inhibition of microglial M1 
polarization by downregulating the expression of IRAK1 and NFAT5.",© 2020 Duan et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S255828

1% of world population. Three polymorphisms of Interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase (IRAK1) gene, rs3027898, rs1059702 and rs1059703, are studied to 
associate with RA risk. However, the findings are inconclusive. Therefore, we 
performed a meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the impact of 
the 3 polymorphisms on RA risk.
METHOD: The strength of association between 3 polymorphisms and RA risk was 
assessed by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Overall, for rs3027898 polymorphism, no association was observed in 
pooled analysis, but the stratified analysis suggested that rs3027898 CA 
genotype was associated with a reduced risk of RA in an Asian population 
(heterozygous model: OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66-0.96, P = .018). Rs1059702 
polymorphism was related with an increased RA risk (homozygous model: OR = 1.59, 
95% CI = 1.19-2.13, P = .002, heterozygous model: OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.17-1.88, 
P = .001, and allele comparison model: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.20-1.53, P < .001). 
Moreover, rs1059703 was also associated with an increased RA risk (dominant 
model: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.07-1.49, P = .006), especially in Caucasian 
populations.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that all 3 Interleukin-1 receptor-associated

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Urinary exosomes, especially microRNAs (miRNAs) packaged within, are 
ideal sources of renal damage markers. We investigated the association between 
exosomal miR-146a, (anti-inflammatory regulator) and disease activity, 
proteinuria and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares over a 36-month 
follow-up period.
METHODS: We isolated urinary exosomes from 41 SLE patients, 27 with lupus 
nephritis (LN) and 20 healthy controls, and exosomal miR-146a, quantified by the 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), was correlated with 
histological features in 13 renal biopsies. We also analysed the association 
between the exosomal miR-146a and TRAF6 axis.
RESULTS: Exosomal miR-146a showed an inverse association with circulating C3 and 
C4 complement components, proteinuria, and with histological features such as 
chronicity index. This marker was able to identify LN with an AUC of 0.82 
(p = 0.001). Basal exosomal miR-146a was associated with disease activity and 
proteinuria changes and was an independent marker of 36-month follow-up flares 
(OR 7.08, p = 0.02). Pathway analysis identified IRAK1 and TRAF6 as miR-146a 
target genes. Finally, in vitro experiments suggested that miR-146a exerts a 
protective effect through negative regulation of inflammation by suppressing 
IRAK1 and TRAF6.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary exosomal miR-146a levels are correlated with lupus 
activity, proteinuria and histological features, discriminating patients with LN 
and being a good baseline marker of SLE flares. We have identified a relevant 
biological miR-146a-TRAF6 axis association in LN renal fibrosis progression.",© 2020. Italian Society of Nephrology.,"DOI: 10.1007/s40620-020-00832-y

affecting the prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Many pathologies are 
involved in EBI, with inflammation and neuronal death being crucial to this 
process. Resolvin D1 (RvD1) has shown superior anti-inflammatory properties by 
interacting with lipoxin A4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2) in 
various diseases. However, it remains not well described about its role in the 
central nervous system (CNS). Thus, the goal of the present study was to 
elucidate the potential functions of the RvD1-ALX/FPR2 interaction in the brain 
after SAH.
METHODS: We used an in vivo model of endovascular perforation and an in vitro 
model of hemoglobin (Hb) exposure as SAH models in the current study. RvD1 was 
used at a concentration of 25 nM in our experiments. Western blotting, 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), immunofluorescence, and other 
chemical-based assays were performed to assess the cellular localizations and 
time course fluctuations in ALX/FPR2 expression, evaluate the effects of RvD1 on 
Hb-induced primary microglial activation and neuronal damage, and confirm the 
role of ALX/FPR2 in the function of RvD1.
RESULTS: ALX/FPR2 was expressed on both microglia and neurons, but not 
astrocytes. RvD1 exerted a good inhibitory effect in the microglial 
pro-inflammatory response induced by Hb, possibly by regulating the 
IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB or MAPK signaling pathways. RvD1 could also potentially 
attenuate Hb-induced neuronal oxidative damage and apoptosis. Finally, the mRNA 
expression of IRAK1/TRAF6 in microglia and GPx1/bcl-xL in neurons was reversed 
by the ALX/FPR2-specific antagonist Trp-Arg-Trp-Trp-Trp-Trp-NH2 (WRW4), 
indicating that ALX/FPR2 could mediate the neuroprotective effects of RvD1.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicated that the RvD1-ALX/FPR2 
interaction could potentially play dual roles in the CNS, as inhibiting Hb 
promoted microglial pro-inflammatory polarization and ameliorating Hb induced 
neuronal oxidant damage and death. These results shed light on a good 
therapeutic target (ALX/FPR2) and a potential effective drug (RvD1) for the 
treatment of SAH and other inflammation-associated brain diseases.","DOI: 10.1186/s12974-020-01918-x

receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) mediates downstream signalling cascades in 
immune response. In the present study, an IRAK1 orthologue was characterized 
from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), with a 2115 bp open reading frame 
(ORF), encoding a protein of 704 amino acids (aa). Multiple alignments showed 
that IRAK1 contains highly conserved features among different species, with a 
conservative N-terminal death domain (DD) and a C-terminal conserved 
serine/threonine protein kinase (STKc) domain. Expression analysis indicated 
that IRAK1 was widely expressed in examined organs/tissues, with the highest 
level observed in muscle and lowest in stomach. In RTG-2 cell line, the induced

disrupted the growth of testicular Sertoli cells (SCs). In the present study, we 
aimed to investigate the potential mechanism by which DBP promotes juvenile SC 
proliferation in vivo and in vitro.
METHODS: Timed pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to vehicle, or DBP (50, 250, 
and 500 mg/kg/day) from 12.5 days of gestation until delivery. In vitro, CCK-8 
and EdU incorporation assays were performed to determine the effect of monobutyl 
phthalate (MBP), the active metabolite of DBP, on the proliferation of TM4 
cells, which are a juvenile testicular SC cell line. Western blotting analysis, 
quantitative PCR (q-PCR), and flow cytometry were performed to analyse the 
expression of genes and proteins related to the proliferation and apoptosis of 
TM4 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation was used to determine the relationship between 
the ubiquitination of interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and the 
effect of MBP on promoting the proliferation of TM4 cells.
RESULTS: In the 50 mg/kg/day DBP-exposed male mice offspring, the number of SCs 
was significantly increased. Consistent with the in vivo results, in vitro 
experiments revealed that 0.1 mM MBP treatment promoted the proliferation of TM4 
cells. Furthermore, the data showed that 0.1 mM MBP-mediated downregulation of 
the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 2 (Peli2) increased ubiquitination of IRAK1 by 
K63, which activated MAPK/JNK signalling, leading to the proliferation of TM4 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to DBP led to abnormal proliferation of SCs in

underlying neonatal death and disability. This study sought to explore the role 
of miR-146b-5p in regulating neonatal HIE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro and in vivo HIE models were established in PC12 
cells and 10-day neonatal Sprague Dawley rats, respectively. Quantitative 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to assess 
miR-146b-5p expression and inflammatory factors [interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α] in brain lesions and PC12 cells, while enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay was employed to detect the expression of oxidative stress 
factors (SOD and GSH-Px). Gain- and loss-assays of miR-146b-5p were conducted to 
verify its role in modulating the viability and apoptosis of PC12 cells under 
oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment. Expression of TLR4, IRAK1, TRAF6, 
TAK1, and NF-κB were examined by qRT-PCR and/or Western blot. Dual luciferase 
activity assay was conducted to identify relationships between miR-146b-5p and 
IRAK1.
RESULTS: In the HIE models, significant oxidative stress and inflammatory 
responses emerged upon upregulation of TLR4/IRAK1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF-κB signaling. 
Overexpression of miR-146b-5p greatly inhibited OGD-induced PC12 cell injury, 
inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. Inhibiting miR-146b-5p, however, 
had the opposite effects. IRAK1 was found to be a target of miR-146b-5p, and 
miR-146b-5p overexpression suppressed the activation of IRAK1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF-κB

chronic liver disease worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Interleukin-1 
receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), the master kinase of Toll-like receptor 
(TLR)/IL-1R-mediated signalling activation, is considered a novel therapeutic 
target in inflammatory diseases, but has not been investigated in the context of 
ALD.
METHODS: IRAK4 phosphorylation and IRAK1 protein were analysed in liver from 
alcohol-related hepatitis patients and healthy controls. IRAK4 kinase 
activity-inactive knock-in (Irak4 KI) mice and bone marrow chimeric mice were 
exposed to chronic ethanol-induced liver injury. IL-1β-induced IRAK4-mediated 
signalling and acute phase response were investigated in cultured hepatocytes. 
IRAK1/4 inhibitor was used to test the therapeutic potential for ethanol-induced 
liver injury in mice.
RESULTS: Increased IRAK4 phosphorylation and reduced IRAK1 protein were found in 
livers of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In the chronic ethanol-induced 
liver injury mouse model, hepatic inflammation and hepatocellular damage were 
attenuated in Irak4 KI mice. IRAK4 kinase activity promotes expression of acute 
phase proteins in response to ethanol exposure, including C-reactive protein and 
serum amyloid A1 (SAA1). SAA1 and IL-1β synergistically exacerbate 
ethanol-induced cell death ex vivo. Pharmacological blockage of IRAK4 kinase 
abrogated ethanol-induced liver injury, inflammation, steatosis, as well as 
acute phase gene expression and protein production in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data elucidate the critical role of IRAK4 kinase activity in 
the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced liver injury in mice and provide preclinical 
validation for use of an IRAK1/4 inhibitor as a new potential therapeutic 
strategy for the treatment of ALD.
LAY SUMMARY: Herein, we have identified the role of IRAK4 kinase activity in the 
development of alcohol-induced liver injury in mice. Hepatocyte-specific IRAK4 
is associated with an acute phase response and release of proinflammatory 
cytokines/chemokines, which synergistically exacerbate alcohol-induced 
hepatocyte cell death ex vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of IRAK4 kinase 
activity effectively attenuates alcohol-induced liver injury in mice and could 
have therapeutic implications.","Copyright © 2020 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by

264.7 macrophages. Prostaglandin E2 production was alleviated by MCA via the 
downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2. MCA treatment also reduced pro-inflammatory 
tumor necrosis factor-[Formula: see text] and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. 
LPS/D-GalN-induced acute hepatitis in mouse was alleviated by MCA treatment. In 
addition, MCA decreased the phosphorylation of inhibitory [Formula: see 
text]B[Formula: see text] (I[Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text]) at Ser32/36 
and thereby blocked I[Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text] degradation. TXY 
motif phosphorylation in the activation loops of mitogen-activated protein 
kinases (MAPKs) was also suppressed by MCA treatment. Further investigation 
revealed that MCA inhibited transforming growth factor-[Formula: see 
text]-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) phosphorylation and IL-1 receptor-associated 
kinase (IRAK1) degradation, the upstream kinases activating nuclear factor 
[Formula: see text]B and MAPKs. Taken together, MCA exhibited anti-inflammatory 
properties via the downregulation of IRAK1-TAK1 signaling pathways.","DOI: 10.1142/S0192415X20500548

role in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis (VM). Our previous 
study demonstrated that long noncoding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) AK085865 
ablation confers susceptibility to VM by regulating macrophage polarization. 
However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which AK085865 regulates 
macrophage polarization remain to be explored. In this study, we found that 
AK085865 specifically interacts with interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 
(ILF2) and facilitates M2 macrophage polarization by functioning as a negative 
regulator in the ILF2-ILF3 complex-mediated microRNA (miRNA or miR) processing 
pathway. miR-192 was downregulated, whereas the levels of pri-miR-192 were 
significantly increased in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from 
AK085865-/- mice compared with the BMDMs from wild-type (WT) mice. Conversely, 
knockdown of ILF2 resulted in elevated levels of mature miR-192 and decreased 
expression of pri-miR-192 in BMDMs from AK085865-/- mice. Moreover, miR-192 
overexpression promoted macrophage M2 polarization in vitro, and interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) was identified as a direct target. miR-192 
overexpression effectively rescued mice from lethal myocarditis caused by CVB3 
infection and switched myocardial-infiltrating macrophages to a predominant M2

and its regulatory role on microRNA (miR-146a) and the downstream genes in 
treating rheumatoid arthritis-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) and 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model.
METHODS: RA-FLS was isolated from knee synovial tissue of an active RA patient. 
In vitro, the effect of miR-146a mimic/inhibition on RA-FLS functions was 
investigated. Then the effect of Iguratimod on cell viability, proliferation, 
apoptosis, migration, invasion, inflammatory cytokines, miR-146a and its 
downstream gene/pathway in RA-FLS was evaluated. In vivo, the collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA) rat model was constructed, then the effects of iguratimod, 
miR-146a inhibition and their combination on treating CIA rat were assessed.
RESULTS: Iguratimod treatment increased miR-146a while decreased cell 
proliferation, IRAK1 and TRAF6/JNK1 pathway in RA-FLS in a dose-dependent 
manner. Notably, iguratimod treatment repressed cell proliferation, migration, 
invasion, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IRAK1 and TRAF6/JNK1 pathway in RA-FLS, 
while miR-146a inhibition alleviated the abovementioned effects of Iguratimod on 
RA-FLS. The in vivo experiments disclosed that iguratimod reduced systemic

Existing antiviral drugs cannot eradicate HBV from our body, and the main reason 
is unclear on the molecular mechanism of HBV replication. Flap endonuclease 1 
(FEN1) can repair relaxed circular DNA (HBV rcDNA) to covalently closed circular 
DNA (HBV cccDNA) that promotes HBV DNA replication, while its specific 
regulatory detail remains unclear. In addition, miR-146a is close related to 
regulation in HBV replication. This study aims to explore whether miR-146a 
regulates HBV cccDNA formation through FEN1.
MAIN METHODS: We investigated the expression of miR-146a, FEN1 and HBV copies in 
HBV stable replication cell line HepG2.2.15 and its parent cell line HepG2 
transfected miR-146a and FEN1 plasmid by qRT-PCR and western blot, to identify 
the cooperation of Argonaute-2 (Ago2) and miR-146a by Ago2 siRNA and Ago2 RNA 
Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP).
KEY FINDINGS: Compared with the control group, we found that the expression of 
miR-146a was significantly up-regulated in HepG2.2.15, and the expression of 
FEN1 and HBV copies were also significantly up-regulated. On contrary, the 
expression of target gene of miR-146a, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 
1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), was 
significantly decreased in HepG2.2.15. With the use of Ago2 siRNA and then Ago2 
RIP, we found that Ago2 performed as a carrier for miR-146a to promote HBV 
replication.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest a novel miR-146a → FEN1 → HBV DNA regulatory 
axis in HBV replication life. Ago2 cooperates with miR-146a to regulate the 
transcription and expression level of FEN1 protein through the downstream target 
gene IRAK1/TRAF6, and to promote HBV replication.",Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118089

nanoparticles (M-NPs) on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/RI) caused by 
orthotopic liver transplantation. In addition, the advantages of TLR4+/M-NPs 
compared to M-NPs are discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prepared biomimetic M-NPs and identified their 
characteristics. M-NPs were injected into an SD rat model of orthotopic liver 
transplantation, and the anti-inflammatory and anti-I/RI activities of M-NPs 
were studied in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we overexpressed macrophage

assessed the characteristics and advantages of TLR4+/M-NPs.
RESULTS: The M-NPs neutralized endotoxin, inhibited the overactivation of 
Kupffer cells (KCs) and suppressed the secretion of inflammatory factors by 
inhibiting the endotoxin-mediated TLR4/MyD88/IRAK1/NF-κB signaling pathway. In 
an orthotopic liver transplantation model in SD rats, M-NPs showed significant 
therapeutic efficacy by neutralizing endotoxin and suppressing the secretion of 
inflammatory factors. Moreover, overexpression of TLR4 on the macrophage 
membrane by using a TLR4+-plasmid in vitro effectively reduced the amount of 
M-NPs needed to neutralize an equivalent dose of endotoxin, reducing the 
potential risks of NP overuse.

hospital were enrolled in the disease group. The diagnosis of ankylosing 
spondylitis was in accordance with the 1984 New York Revised Criteria for 
Ankylosing Spondylitis. Meanwhile, 200 healthy people were taken as the control 
group. Peripheral blood was collected from patients in both disease group and

RESULTS: The allele distribution of miR-146a rs7702165 (p=0.008) and that of 
IRAK1 rs3027898 (p=0.004) in disease group were significantly different from 
those in control group. Besides, the allele T frequency of miR-146a rs7702165

group. It was discovered that the genotype of miR-146a rs2910164 was correlated 
with the expressions of miR-146a (p=0.024) and IRAK1 (p=0.002). Similarly, IRAK1 
gene polymorphism rs763737 was related to the expression of IRAK1 (p=0.023), 
Furthermore, miR-146a gene polymorphism rs7702165 was associated with the level 
of human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) (p<0.05), and patients with genotype GG

(#)Contributed equally","Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique head and neck cancer with highly 
aggressive and metastatic potential in which distant metastasis is the main 
reason for treatment failure. Till present, the underlying molecular mechanisms 
of NPC metastasis remains poorly understood. Here, we identified S100 
calcium-binding protein A14 (S100A14) as a functional regulator suppressing NPC 
metastasis by inhibiting the NF-kB signaling pathway and reversing the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). S100A14 was found to be downregulated 
in highly metastatic NPC cells and tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of 202 
NPC samples revealed that lower S100A14 expression was significantly correlated 
with shorter patient overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival 
(DMFS). S100A14 was also found as an independent prognostic factor for favorable 
survival. Gain- and loss-of-function studies confirmed that S100A14 suppressed 
the in vitro and in vivo motility of NPC cells. Mechanistically, S100A14 
promoted the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) to suppress NPC cellular migration. 
Moreover, S100A14 and IRAK1 established a feedback loop that could be disrupted

triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Previously, we have reported that 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and its downstream pathways 
are associated with PTX resistance in TNBC cells. In this study, we sought to 
investigate the combination treatment of ginsenoside panaxatriol (GPT), one of 
the main active components in Panax ginseng, with PTX on viability and apoptosis 
of TNBC PTX resistant cells, and explore the role of IRAK1 mediated signaling 
pathways in the therapeutic effects.
METHODS: CellTiter-Glo and colony formation assays were used to assess cell 
viability. Flow cytometry was used to analyze subG1 and apoptosis. Western blot 
was used to detect expressions of proteins involved in apoptosis and the 
IRAK1/NF-κB and ERK pathways. The mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, 
S100A7/8/9 and cancer stem cell (CSC)-related genes were examined by qPCR. Stem 
cells were identified by tumor sphere assay. Cell invasion ability was examined 
by transwell assay.
RESULTS: We show that GPT inhibits MDA-MB-231 PTX resistant (MB231-PR) cell 
viability in a dose-dependent manner. When combined with PTX, GPT 
synergistically causes more cell death, induces subG1 accumulation and cell 
apoptosis. Besides, up-regulation of BAX/BCL-2 ratio, and down-regulation of 
MCL-1 are also observed. Moreover, this combination inhibits IRAK1, NF-κB and 
ERK1/2 activation, and leads to down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines (IL6, 
IL8, CXCL1, CCL2), S100A7/9 and CSC-related genes (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, ALDH1, 
CD44) expression. In addition, the combination treatment suppresses MB231-PR 
cell invasion ability, and impairs tumor sphere growth both in MB231-PR and 
SUM159 PTX resistant (SUM159-PR) cells.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that GPT can resensitize TNBC PTX resistant 
cells to PTX by inhibiting the IRAK1/NF-κB and ERK pathways and reducing stem 
cell characteristics.",© 2020 Wang et al.,"DOI: 10.7717/peerj.9281

receptor (TLR) signaling is a key aspect of the innate immune response, and 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) plays a vital role in the TLR 
signaling cascade. Each TLR recognizes a distinct set of pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs) that encompass conserved microbial components such as 
lipopolysaccharides and flagellin. Upon binding of PAMPs and TLR activation, TLR 
intracellular domains initiate the oligomerization of the myeloid 
differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), IRAK1, IRAK2, and IRAK4 signaling 
platform known as the Myddosome complex while also triggering the Toll/IL-1R 
domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF)-dependent pathway. The Myddosome 
complex initiates signal transduction pathways enabling the activation of NF-κB 
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) transcription factors and the 
subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines. Human IRAK4 deficiency is an 
autosomal recessive inborn error of immunity that classically presents with 
blunted or delayed inflammatory response to infection and susceptibility to a 
narrow spectrum of pyogenic bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae,

disease. The present study intends to specify rs1059703, rs4810485, and 
rs1883832 gene polymorphisms of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) 
and cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) in RA. IRAK1 is a serine/threonine 
kinase and CD40 is a tumor necrosis factor receptor, both of which are involved 
in RA. There are conflicting results on functional effects of these 
polymorphisms, so we performed this research for a more accurate estimation on 
rheumatoid arthritis risk. Methods: Two-hundred RA patients diagnosed according 
to ACR criteria and 200 normal controls participated in this case-control study. 
DNA Purification kit (Gene Transfer Pioneers, GTP) was used for genomic DNA 
extraction and three SNPs, including IRAK1 rs1059703 (C/T), CD40 rs1883832 (C/T) 
and rs4810485 (G/T), were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. The genotypes and allele 
frequencies of SNPs were analyzed by chi-square test to detect their 
contribution to RA. Results: A significant correlation was found between 
rs1059703 T allele (OR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.7-3.1, p = .0001) and TT and CT 
genotypes (TT genotype, OR = 2.54, 95%CI = 1.2-3.3, P = .0078, CT genotype; 
OR = 2.18 95%CI = 1.4-3.2P = .0002) of rs1059703 C/T polymorphism in terms of 
susceptibility to RA in recessive and over-dominant models. Alleles and 
genotypes of CD40 SNPs were not significantly different between RA cases and 
controls. The findings showed significant differences in rs1059703 IRAK1 
genotypes with medical and laboratory features of patients. Conclusion: Our 
results showed that the rs1059703 T allele (risk allele) of IRAK1 gene increases 
the risk of RA and the severity of disease, affecting the onset age of RA in 
Iranian patients.","DOI: 10.1080/08820139.2020.1764028

on the sexual diploid in immune response. The IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1) gene on the X chromosome was recently suggested as strong autoimmune 
disease-susceptible loci, second to the major histocompatibility complex region. 
We investigated the frequency of IRAK1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
children with AITD. In this study, we observed that SNPs of IRAK1 including 
rs3027898, rs1059703, and rs1059702 in 115 Korean AITD pediatric patients 
(Graves' disease = 74 [females = 52/males = 22]; Hashimoto disease [HD] = 41 
[females = 38/males = 3]; thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy [TAO] = 40 (females 
= 27/males = 13); without TAO = 75 (females = 63/males = 12); total males = 25, 
total females = 90; mean age = 11.9 years) and 204 healthy Korean individuals 
(males = 104/females = 100). The data from cases and controls were analyzed from 
separate sex-stratified or all combined by χ 2 test for categorical variables 
and Student t test for numerical variables. Our study revealed that SNPs of 
IRAK1-associated HD and without TAO but Graves' disease and TAO were not found 
significant. When cases and controls were analyzed by separate sex, we found 
that rs3027898 AA, rs1059703 AA, and rs1059702 GG showed disease susceptibility 
in female AITD, HD, and without TAO. Also, all rs3027898, rs1059703, and 
rs1059702 were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.96-0.98, r2 
= 0.83-0.97). The haplotype of 3 SNPs was higher in AITD than in controls (CGA, 
r2 = 5.42, P = 0.019). Our results suggest that IRAK1 polymorphisms may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of HD, AITD, and without thyroid-associated

pathways and is a key player in the pathological mechanisms involved in the 
development of endometritis. This study aimed to investigate LPS-induced DNA 
methylation changes in bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs), which may 
affect endometrial function. Following in vitro culture, bEECs from three cows 
were either untreated (0) or exposed to 2 and 8 μg/mL LPS for 24 h.
RESULTS: DNA samples extracted at 0 h and 24 h were sequenced using reduced 
representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). When comparing DNA methylation 
results at 24 h to time 0 h, a larger proportion of hypomethylated regions were 
identified in the LPS-treated groups, whereas the trend was opposite in 
controls. When comparing LPS groups to controls at 24 h, a total of 1291 
differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified (55% hypomethylated and 
45% hypermethylated). Integration of DNA methylation data obtained here with our 
previously published gene expression data obtained from the same samples showed 
a negative correlation (r = - 0.41 for gene promoter, r = - 0.22 for gene body 
regions, p < 0.05). Differential methylation analysis revealed that effects of 
LPS treatment were associated with methylation changes for genes involved in 
regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, and external 
stimuli. Gene ontology and pathway analyses showed that most of the 
differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were associated with cell proliferation 
and apoptotic processes; and pathways such as calcium-, oxytocin- and 
MAPK-signaling pathways with recognized roles in innate immunity. Several DMGs 
were related to systemic inflammation and tissue re-modelling including HDAC4, 
IRAK1, AKT1, MAP3K6, Wnt7A and ADAMTS17.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that LPS altered the DNA methylation 
patterns of bovine endometrial epithelial cells. This information, combined with 
our previously reported changes in gene expression related to endometrial 
function, confirm that LPS activates pro-inflammatory mechanisms leading to 
perturbed immune balance and cell adhesion processes in the endometrium.","DOI: 10.1186/s12864-020-06777-7

of the main methods of breast cancer treatment, but this method is increasingly 
affected due to drug resistance. One of the newly discovered factors associated 
with drug resistance in cancer cells is interleukin receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IRAK1 
inhibition and sensitivity to methotrexate (MTX). Effects of various 
concentrations of MTX and constant concentration (1μg/ml) of IRAK1/4 inhibitor 
was examined on MCF-7, BT-20, BT-549, MB-468 cell lines. Cell viability was 
examined by water soluble tetrazole -1, and cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. 
The expression of IRAK1 and BCRP genes was also assessed by real-time PCR 
method. IRAK1 inhibitor decreased IC50 in all examined cell lines, but the most 
prominent effect was observed in MB-468. 72 h incubation of cell lines with IRAK 
inhibitor and MTX, significantly increased the annexin-V and annexin-V/7AAD 
positive cells, suggesting an apoptotic effect of IRAK on all examined breast 
cancer cell lines. RT-qPCR test results showed that the IRAK inhibitor had no 
effect on the expression of BCRP at any time. Our results showed that IRAK 
inhibitor can increase the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cell lines without 
effect on BCRP mRNA expression. IRAK inhibitor in combination with MTX can 
induce apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines.","DOI: 10.22088/IJMCM.BUMS.8.3.200

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation, which contributes 
to cardiovascular diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported to be involved in 
vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. Abelmoschus esculentus (AE) and 
metformin have been suggested to improve inflammation in vascular system. The 
aim of this study is to evaluate whether miRNAs are involved in high fat induced 
endothelial inflammation, and whether AE and metformin improve endothelial 
inflammation by regulating miRNAs.
METHODS: We established high fat treated rats and human aortic endothelial cells 
(HAECs). AE and metformin were added to explore their effects on endothelial 
inflammation induced by high fat and the possible mechanism.
RESULTS: The vascular inflammatory genes were increased in rats treated with 
high fat diet. The decreased miR-146a and miR-155 were involved in endothelial 
inflammation induced by high fat through targeting IL-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and nuclear factor-κB 
p65 (NF-κB p65), respectively. While AE and metformin could ameliorate the 
endothelial inflammation by increasing miR-146a and miR-155.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that miR-146a and miR-155 play roles in the 
high fat induced endothelial inflammation, which could be potential therapeutic 
targets. AE and metformin can attenuate endothelial inflammation through 
regulating miR-146a and miR-155.",© The Author(s) 2020.,"DOI: 10.1186/s12986-020-00459-7

disease caused by feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and has led to severe 
consequences on pets, economically important animals, and the wildlife industry. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play significant roles in the host-pathogen interaction by 
modulating cellular factors expression which are essential for viral replication 
or host innate immune response to infection. However, the role of host miRNA 
response in FPV infection remains to be discovered. In this study, we screened 
nine host miRNAs associated with FPV infection that were previously implicated 
in innate immunity or antiviral functions. We found that miR-1343-5p 
overexpression strongly promoted FPV-BJ04 genomic DNA. Subsequently, the 
expression of host miR-1343-5p was upregulated by FPV-BJ04 infection in vitro 
and in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-1343-5p was a negative 
regulator of the IFN-I signaling pathway, thereby promoting FPV infection. 
Bioinformatic analysis combined with molecular biological assay indicated that 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a putative target of

established the role of treating inflammation in atherosclerosis, our 
understanding of endothelial activation at atherosclerosis-prone sites remains 
limited. Disturbed flow at atheroprone regions primes plaque inflammation by 
enhancing endothelial NF-κB signaling. Herein, we demonstrate a role for the Nck 
adaptor proteins in disturbed flow-induced endothelial activation. Although 
highly similar, only Nck1 deletion, but not Nck2 deletion, limited flow-induced 
NF-κB activation and proinflammatory gene expression. Nck1-knockout mice showed 
reduced endothelial activation and inflammation in both models, disturbed flow-

marrow chimeras confirmed that vascular Nck1, but not hematopoietic Nck1, 
mediated this effect. Domain-swap experiments and point mutations identified the 
Nck1 SH2 domain and the first SH3 domain as critical for flow-induced 
endothelial activation. We further characterized Nck1's proinflammatory role by 
identifying interleukin 1 type I receptor kinase-1 (IRAK-1) as a Nck1-selective 
binding partner, demonstrating that IRAK-1 activation by disturbed flow required 
Nck1 in vitro and in vivo, showing endothelial Nck1 and IRAK-1 staining in early

are important in transducing signal from Toll-like receptor 4. We interrogated 
if a selective inhibition of IRAK1 could alleviate lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced sepsis. In this study, we tested the impact of a novel selective 
IRAK1 inhibitor Jh-X-119-01 on LPS-induced sepsis in mice. Survival at day 5 was 
13.3% in control group where septic mice were treated by vehicle, while the 
values were 37.5% (p = 0.046, vs. control) and 56.3% (p = 0.003, vs. control) 
for 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Jh-X-119-01-treated mice. Jh-X-119-01 alleviated lung 
injury and reduced production of TNFα and IFNγ in peritoneal macrophages. 
Jh-X-119-01 decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB and mRNA levels of IL-6 and TNFα 
in LPS-treated macrophages in vitro. Jh-X-119-01 selectively inhibited IRAK1 
phosphorylation comparing with a non-selective IRAK1/4 inhibitor which 
simultaneously inhibited phosphorylation of IRAK1 and IRAK4. Both Jh-X-119-01

innate immune system of TLR (Toll-like receptor) signaling pathway. In this 
paper, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-b (designated as McIRAK-b) and 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-a (named as McIRAK-a) were obtained 
based on the transcriptome data, the full length of McIRAK-b was 1815 bp and 
McIRAK-a was 3168bp, encoding 532 and 978 amino acids, respectively. BLASTp 
analysis and phylogenetic relationship strongly suggested that the deduced amino 
acid sequence of McIRAK-b had high homology with IRAK-4 and McIRAK-a was similar 
to IRAK-1 of other mollusks, especially at their function domains. The 
expressions of McIRAK-b and McIRAK-a were detected in six tissues including 
adductor muscle, hemocyte, gills, gonad and hepatopancreas, and the highest 
expressions appeared both in gills. The expressions of McIRAK-b and McIRAK-a in 
gills were observed with time-dependent manners after bacterial infections. 
After being challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, McIRAK-b expressed 
significantly and got the peak at 8 h (9.47 times compared with the control 
group), but the peak appeared at 4 h by being infected with Vibrio 
parahaemolyticus (12.02 times compared with the control group). The highest 
point of McIRAK-a mRNA appeared at 12 h (5.16 times) after being challenged with 
V.alginolyticus and 8 h (4.21 times) for V.parahaemolyticus challenge. The 
results suggested that IRAK-b and IRAK-a might be important in immune signaling 
pathway of mussels. The kinase functional domain sequences (S_TKc) of McIRAK-b 
and McIRAK-a expressed in BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni-NAT Superflow resin

(miR-146a) in human lung adenocarcinoma cells, its effect on cellular behaviors, 
and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR 
(RT-qPCR) was used to measure miR-146a expression in the human normal lung 
epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, and human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549, 
PC-9 and H1299, to determine whether miR-146a acts as an oncogene or 
anti-oncogene. miR-146a mimics were transfected into target cells to observe the 
proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of human lung adenocarcinoma 
cells. The target genes of miR-146a were predicted using bioinformatics 
analysis, and binding sites were validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. 
Target gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels was measured by RT-qPCR 
and western blot analysis, respectively. The expression levels of miR-146a in 
human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were lower than its expression in BEAS-2B 
(P<0.01). A549 cell line is a EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma cell line, 
which is also the most widely studied in NSCLC, and therefore this was chosen as 
the target cell line for further investigation. Overexpression of miR-146a in 
A549 cells can inhibit cell proliferation (P<0.05), promote apoptosis (P<0.05), 
and reduce the cells' migratory ability (P<0.01). Bioinformatics prediction 
indicated that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF 
receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) are the target genes of miR-146a. 
Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-146a could specifically bind to 
3'-untranslated regions of IRAK1 and TRAF6. The protein and mRNA levels of IRAK1 
and TRAF6 were significantly downregulated after miR-146a overexpression in A549 
cells (P<0.01). The results of this study demonstrated that the expression of 
miR-146a in human lung adenocarcinoma cells was significantly lower than in 
normal lung epithelial cells, indicating that miR-146a acts as an anti-oncogene.

response. The Myddosome, which mainly contains TLR4, TIRAP, MyD88, IRAK1/4 and 
TRAF6 proteins, is regarded as a major complex of TLR4. Although the Myddosome 
has been well studied, a quantitative description of the Myddosome assembly 
dynamics is still lacking. Furthermore, whether some unknown TLR4 complexes 
exist remains unclear. In this study, we constructed a SWATH-MS data-based 
mathematical model that describes the component assembly dynamics of TLR4 
complexes. In addition to Myddosome, we suggest that a TIRAP-independent MyD88 
activation complex is formed upon LPS stimulation, in which TRAF6 is not 
included. Furthermore, quantitative analysis reveals that the distribution of 
components in TIRAP-dependent and -independent MyD88 activation complexes are 
LPS stimulation-dependent. The two complexes compete for recruiting IRAK1/4 
proteins. MyD88 forms higher-order assembly in the Myddosome and we show that 
the strategy to form higher-order assembly is also LPS stimulation-dependent. 
MyD88 forms a long chain upon weak stimulation, but forms a short chain upon 
strong stimulation. Higher-order assembly of MyD88 is directly determined by the 
level of TIRAP in the Myddosome, providing a formation mechanism for efficient 
signaling transduction. Taken together, our study provides an enhanced 
understanding of component assembly dynamics and strategies in TLR4 complexes.","DOI: 10.3390/ijms21093061

athletes, comparing gene modulation before, after and in the absence of an 
8-week nutritional intervention with multivitamin/mineral supplements.
METHODS: Thirteen elite handball athletes (aged 22.9 ± 2.7 years) and 13 
sedentary controls (aged 20.9 ± 2.8 years) were included. Three timepoints were 
established: T0 (baseline conditions); T8 (after 8 weeks of supplementation with 
a multivitamin/mineral complex); and T16 (after 8 weeks in the absence of 
supplementation). The expressions of a total 112 of genes were evaluated by 
RT-qPCR analysis with the QuantStudioTM 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed different gene regulation profiles of genes 
implicated in cell communication, cell energy metabolism, inflammation and the 
immune system, oxidative stress and muscle function in athletes compared to 
sedentary controls under resting conditions (upregulated genes: effect size = 
large, ƞ2 = 1.011 to 1.398, p < 0.05; downregulated genes: effect size = large, 
ƞ2 = 0.846 and 1.070, p < 0.05, respectively). The nutritional intervention 
encouraged gene upregulation in elite athletes (p < 0.05). In a follow-up 
investigation, the IRAK1, CD81, ITGB1, ACADS PDHA2 and GPX1 genes were 
downregulated in athletes, with a moderate main effect for time-by-group 
interaction (ηP2 = 0.099 to 0.133; p < 0.05). Additionally, nutritional genes 
such as MTHFR and THTPA revealed a moderate effect over all the timepoints and 
group interaction in the study (ηP2 = 0.070 to 0.092; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Elite handball athletes showed a different expression profile in 
reference to key genes implicated in several sports performance-related 
functions compared to the sedentary controls, in addition to modulation of gene 
expression after multivitamin/mineral supplementation.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0232237

activity in intestinal epithelium, and its role in necrotizing enterocolitis 
(NEC).
METHODS: Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were injected into the amniotic cavity of 
pregnant mice under ultrasound guidance. The effects of LPS on fetal and 
neonatal intestines were determined. Mouse pups were exposed to low dose LPS 
(0.01 μg per fetus) prenatally and subjected to experimental NEC after birth. 
The incidence and severity of NEC, as well as intestinal permeability, NF-κB 
activation, and IL-6 expression were studied. The signaling pathways in the 
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) that were activated by LPS were also 
investigated.
RESULTS: Low dose LPS did not increase apoptosis, myeloperoxidase activity, 
histological injury or NF-κB activity in fetal intestines. However, prenatal low 
dose LPS exposure disturbed the transient and self-limited activation of NF-κB 
in neonatal intestines after birth. Importantly, it increased the incidence and 
severity of experimental NEC in neonatal mice. In primary IECs, low dose LPS 
induced IRAK-1 expression via activation of GSK3β. Elevated IRAK-1 levels 
prolonged the activation of IECs upon stimulation by high dose LPS.
CONCLUSION: Prenatal low dose endotoxin exposure disturbs self-limited postnatal 
epithelial cell activation and predisposes the neonatal intestine to NEC.

neuronal damage. Hence, limiting microglial activation and brain inflammation is 
a good therapeutic strategy for inflammatory-associated central nervous disease. 
MiR-146a is a promising therapeutic microRNA, since it can negatively regulate 
the inflammatory response. We thus investigated the expression changes of 
miR-146a after experimental induction of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in vivo 
and in vitro, and we assessed the anti-inflammatory effects of miR-146a in 
microglial cells in vitro. Primary microglial cells were preincubated with 
miR-146a before hemoglobin (Hb) treatment. The results indicated that miR-146a 
decreased gene expression of Hb-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and 
IL-1β) and phenotype-related genes (iNOS and CD86) through IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB or 
MAPK signaling pathways, suggesting its pro-resolution activity in microglia. 
However, contrary to the LPS-induced microglia or macrophage activation model, 
we did not observe an elevation in miR-146a after activation. Overall, our 
findings demonstrated that miR-146a was involved in the regulation of brain 
inflammation and could be considered a novel therapeutic agent for treating 
brain inflammation.","Copyright © 2020 Liu, Zhang, Gao, Wang, Tao, Gao, Zhou, Chen, Li and Hang.","DOI: 10.3389/fnins.2020.00311

inhibitory role in a wide range of immune responses. IRAK1 (IL-1

body. STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activated by

sequences. The expression of CiIRAK1 and CiSTAT3 were up-regulated significantly 
under the stimulation of LPS. This result suggests that both CiIRAK1 and CiSTAT3 
may be involved in LPS-induced TLR4 pathway. The subcellular localization 
experiment revealed that CiIRAK1 is distributed in cytoplasm and enters nucleus 
after LPS stimulation. CiSTAT3 is distributed in both cytoplasm and nucleus with 
or without LPS stimulation. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed that CiIRAK1 
interacted with CiSTAT3 under LPS stimulation. However in absence of LPS

colony-stimulating factor (rbG-CSF) that promotes the increased count and 
functionality of polymorphonuclear cells in dairy cows around the time of 
parturition. We hypothesized that pegbovigrastim administered to periparturient 
cows at approximately seven days before parturition and within 24 hours after 
calving could affect the profiles of gene networks involved in leukocyte 
function. Blood was collected on Day 3 after calving from treated groups 
(pegbovigrastim (PEG); 13 Simmental (seven multiparous and six primiparous) and 
13 Holstein (seven multiparous and six primiparous) cows) that received 
pegbovigrastim (Imrestor; Elanco Animal Health) and controls (CTR; 13 Simmental 
(seven multiparous and six primiparous) and 13 Holstein (six multiparous and 
seven primiparous) cows) that received saline solution. Blood from all cows was 
sampled from the jugular vein in a PAXgene Blood RNA System tube (Preanalytix, 
Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) for RNA extraction. The RT-qPCR analysis was 
performed to investigate a panel of 34 genes of interest, representing 
recognition, immune mediation, migration, cell adhesion, antimicrobial 
strategies, inflammatory cascade, oxidative pattern, and leukotrienes in whole 
blood leukocytes. Normalized data were subjected to the MIXED model of SAS (ver. 
9.4) with treatment, breed, parity, and their interaction as fixed effects. 
Compared with CTR, whole blood leukocytes of PEG cows had higher expression of 
genes involved in recognition and immune modulation (CD14, CD16, MYD88, TLR2, 
and TLR4), cell adhesion (ITGB2, ITGAL, TLN1, SELL, SELPLG, and CD44), 
antimicrobial activity (MMP9, LTF, and LCN2), and inflammatory cascade (CASP1, 
TNFRSF1A, IL1B, IL1R, IL18, IRAK1, NLRP3, and S100A8). This suggested an 
improvement of migration, adhesion, and antimicrobial ability and an enhanced 
inflammatory response, which in turn could trigger immune cell activation and 
enhance function. Expression of SOD2 and ALOX5 was also greater in the PEG 
group. In contrast, compared with CTR cows, PEG led to lower expression of 
RPL13A, ALOX15, IL8, and TNF. Overall, leukocytes from Simmental compared with 
Holstein cows had greater expression of IDO1, RPL13A, ALOX5, CD44, CX3CR1, 
ITGB2, and TNFA, whereas expression of CD16 and TLR2 was lower. Overall, 
compared with multiparous cows, primiparous cows had higher expression of IL1B, 
IL18, MYD88, SELL, and TLR2 and lower expression of MMP9. Simmental cows seemed 
more sensitive to induction of the immune system after calving, as revealed by 
the greater abundance of genes involved in immune system adaptation, regardless 
of pegbovigrastim treatment. Primiparous cows undergoing a new stress condition 
with respect to older cows were characterized by leukocytes with a higher 
inflammatory response. In conclusion, pegbovigrastim led to higher expression 
levels of most genes involved in the processes investigated, suggesting a 
thorough activation of the immune machinery during the critical post-partum 
period.","DOI: 10.3390/ani10040621

triggered by chorioamnionitis or intrauterine inflammation (IUI) with or without 
infection. Recently, there has been a strong association of IL-1 with PTB. We 
hypothesized that IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), a key signaling mediator in 
the TLR/IL-1 pathway, plays a critical role in PTB. In human fetal membranes 
(FM) collected immediately after birth from women delivering preterm, p-IRAK1 
was significantly increased in all the layers of FM with chorioamnionitis, 
compared with no-chorioamnionitis subjects. In a preterm rhesus macaque model of 
IUI given intra-amniotic LPS, induction of p-IRAK1 and downstream 
proinflammatory signaling mediators were seen in the FM. In a C57BL/6J wild-type 
PTB mouse model of IUI given intrauterine LPS, an IRAK1 inhibitor significantly 
decreased PTB and increased live birth in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 
IRAK1 knockout mice were protected from LPS-induced PTB, which was seen in 
wild-type controls. Activation of IRAK1 was maintained by K63-mediated 
ubiquitination in preterm FM of humans with chorioamnionitis and rhesus and 
mouse IUI models. Mechanistically, IRAK1 induced PTB in the mouse model of IUI 
by upregulating expression of COX-2. Thus, our data from human, rhesus, and 
mouse demonstrates a critical role IRAK1 in IUI and inflammation-associated PTB 
and suggest it as potential therapeutic target in IUI-induced PTB.","Copyright © 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1901368

avoid excessive inflammation and unwanted damage to the host. Myeloid 
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) is a critical adaptor of TLR 
signaling. Here, we identified the speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) as a 
MyD88-associated protein. SPOP was recruited to MyD88 following TLR4 activation. 
TLR4 activation also caused the translocation of SPOP from the nucleus to the 
cytoplasm. SPOP depletion promoted the aggregation of MyD88 and recruitment of 
the downstream signaling kinases IRAK4, IRAK1 and IRAK2. Consistently, 
overexpression of SPOP inhibited the TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB and 
production of inflammatory cytokines, whereas SPOP depletion had the opposite 
effects. Furthermore, knockdown of SPOP increased MyD88 aggregation and 
inflammatory cytokine production upon TLR2, TLR7 and TLR9 activation. Our 
findings reveal a mechanism by which MyD88 is regulated and highlight a role for 
SPOP in limiting inflammatory responses.","DOI: 10.1038/s41423-020-0411-1

involved in the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder 
affecting neuromuscular junction mainly mediated by antiacetylcholine receptor 
antibodies. Considerable evidence indicate that uncontrolled TLR activation and 
chronic inflammation significantly contribute to hyperplastic changes and 
germinal center (GC) formation in the MG thymus, ultimately leading to 
autoantibody production and autoimmunity. miR-146a is a key modulator of innate 
immunity, whose dysregulation has been associated with autoimmune diseases. It 
acts as inhibitor of TLR pathways, mainly by targeting the nuclear factor kappa 
B (NF-κB) signaling transducers, interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6); 
miR-146a is also able to target c-REL, inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS), and 
Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS), known to regulate B-cell function and GC 
response. Herein, we investigated the miR-146a contribution to the intrathymic 
MG pathogenesis. By real-time PCR, we found that miR-146a expression was 
significantly downregulated in hyperplastic MG compared to control thymuses; 
contrariwise, IRAK1, TRAF6, c-REL, and ICOS messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were 
upregulated and negatively correlated with miR-146a levels. Microdissection 
experiments revealed that miR-146a deficiency in hyperplastic MG thymuses was 
not due to GCs, but restricted to the GC-surrounding medulla, characterized by 
IRAK1 overexpression. We also showed higher c-REL and ICOS mRNA levels, and 
lower FAS mRNA levels, in GCs than in the remaining medulla, according to the 
contribution of these molecules in GC formation. By double immunofluorescence, 
an increased proportion of IRAK1-expressing dendritic cells and macrophages was 
found in hyperplastic MG compared to control thymuses, along with GC 
immunoreactivity for c-REL. Interestingly, in corticosteroid-treated MG patients 
intrathymic miR-146a and mRNA target levels were comparable to those of 
controls, suggesting that immunosuppressive therapy may restore the microRNA 
(miRNA) levels. Indeed, an effect of prednisone on miR-146a expression was 
demonstrated in vitro on peripheral blood cells. Serum miR-146a levels were 
lower in MG patients compared to controls, indicating dysregulation of the 
circulating miRNA. Our overall findings strongly suggest that defective miR-146a 
expression could contribute to persistent TLR activation, lack of inflammation 
resolution, and hyperplastic changes in MG thymuses, thus linking TLR-mediated 
innate immunity to B-cell-mediated autoimmunity. Furthermore, they unraveled a 
new mechanism of action of corticosteroids in inducing control of autoimmunity 
in MG via miR-146a.","Copyright © 2020 Bortone, Scandiffio, Marcuzzo, Bonanno, Frangiamore, Motta,

little is known about the biogenesis, function and mechanism of miR-146a in 
cementoblasts during the pathogenesis of periodontitis. This study aimed to 
investigate the effects of miR-146a in murine cementoblast-derived OCCM-30 cells 
following IL-1β stimulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: OCCM-30 cells were cultured and exposed to IL-1β. IL-6, 
IL-1β and TNF-α, and miR-146a-5p expression was assessed by qRT-PCR. 
Mimics/inhibitors were transiently transfected into cells to determine the 
function of miR-146a-5p. Signalling pathways including p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and 
NF-κB were studied by using specific inhibitors. The indicated proteins were 
measured by Western blot analysis and ELISA.
RESULTS: In IL-1β-stimulated OCCM-30 cells, the expression levels of miR-146a-5p 
along with IL-6 and IL-1β increased in a time-dependent manner. The ERK1/2, p38 
MAPK and NF-κB pathway were activated upon IL-1β stimulation. Blocking the NF-κB 
pathway decreased IL-6, IL-1β and miR-146a-5p expression. The overexpression of

polymorphisms have been demonstrated to be associated with the risks of several 
autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune thyroid diseases. However, no studies have 
investigated the association of IRAK1 polymorphisms with neuromyelitis optica 
spectrum disorder (NMOSD). This case-control study was performed to determine 
the correlation between IRAK1 polymorphisms and the risk of NMOSD.
METHODS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1059703G>A and 
rs3027898C>A of IRAK1 were selected and genotyped using SNPscan in a Chinese 
cohort, including 332 patients with NMOSD and 520 healthy controls. Chi-square 
tests and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the associations 
between IRAK1 polymorphisms and the risk of NMOSD.
RESULTS: Patients with NMOSD showed a lower frequency of the minor allele A of 
rs1059703 than did controls (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.68; 95% confidence intervals 
[CI], 0.52-0.88; Pcorr = 0.007). Compared with wild genotype GG of rs1059703, 
homozygous mutation AA and heterozygous mutation GA were significantly 
associated with the decreased risk of NMOSD after adjusting for sex and age 
(adjusted OR = 0.64; 95%CI, 0.49-0.84; Pcorr = 0.002). Similar associations were 
also observed for IRAK1 rs3027898C>A. Stratification analysis according to sex 
revealed that the significantly different allele distributions of the two SNPs 
were mainly found in females. However, IRAK1 polymorphisms were not correlated 
with aquaporin-4-IgG, onset symptoms, or age at onset.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is first to demonstrate that X-chromosome-linked IRAK1 
polymorphisms are associated with the risk of NMOSD and provide novel insights 
into the underlying mechanisms of this disease. Further studies are needed to 
elucidate the function of IRAK1 variants in the pathogenesis of NMOSD and the 
underlying molecular mechanisms.",Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.msard.2019.101438

primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) development. Alterations in cellular signaling 
pathways are also a characteristic of PEL. Other B cell lymphomas have acquired 
an oncogenic mutation in the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) 
gene. The MYD88 L265P mutant results in the activation of interleukin-1 receptor 
associated kinase (IRAK). To probe IRAK/MYD88 signaling in PEL, we employed 
CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate stable deletion clones in BCBL-1Cas9 and 
BC-1Cas9 cells. To look for off-target effects, we determined the complete exome 
of the BCBL-1Cas9 and BC-1Cas9 cells. Deletion of either MYD88, IRAK4, or IRAK1 
abolished interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) signaling; however, we were able to grow 
stable subclones from each population. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) 
analysis of IRAK4 knockout cell lines (IRAK4 KOs) showed that the IRAK pathway 
induced cellular signals constitutively, independent of IL-1β stimulation, which 
was abrogated by deletion of IRAK4. Transient complementation with IRAK1 
increased NF-κB activity in MYD88 KO, IRAK1 KO, and IRAK4 KO cells even in the 
absence of IL-1β. IL-10, a hallmark of PEL, was dependent on the IRAK pathway, 
as IRAK4 KOs showed reduced IL-10 levels. We surmise that, unlike B cell 
receptor (BCR) signaling, MYD88/IRAK signaling is constitutively active in PEL, 
but that under cell culture conditions, PEL rapidly became independent of this 
pathway.IMPORTANCE One hundred percent of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cases 
are associated with Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). PEL cell 
lines, such as BCBL-1, are the workhorse for understanding this human oncovirus 
and the host pathways that KSHV dysregulates. Understanding their function is 
important for developing new therapies as well as identifying high-risk patient 
groups. The myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88)/interleukin-1 
receptor associated kinase (IRAK) pathway, which has progrowth functions in 
other B cell lymphomas, has not been fully explored in PEL. By performing 
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) studies targeting the IRAK pathway in PEL, we were 
able to determine that established PEL cell lines can circumvent the loss of 
IRAK1, IRAK4, and MYD88; however, the deletion clones are deficient in 
interleukin-10 (IL-10) production. Since IL-10 suppresses T cell function, this 
suggests that the IRAK pathway may serve a function in vivo and during 
early-stage development of PEL.",Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.,"DOI: 10.1128/JVI.02123-19

(ceRNAs), can regulate various pathophysiological processes by binding 
competitively to microRNAs at the post-transcription level. Our previous work 
demonstrated that miR-146a-5p was lowly expressed in diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy (DPN) rats. However, the ceRNA network in DPN mediated by lncRNAs and 
miR-146a-5p remains to be explored.
METHODS: Two groups of rats (n=4 per group), a type 2 diabetes (T2DM) group and 
a DPN group, were used in this study. Sciatic nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of 
each rat was determined at the 6th and the 12th week. LncRNA microarray analysis 
was performed in the sciatic nerve of DPN and T2DM rats. Based on the TargetScan 
algorithm and the miRanda database, we determined the differentially expressed 
(DE) lncRNAs bound to miR-146a-5p. Furthermore, we verified the DE lncRNAs 
potentially bound to miR-146a-5p by qRT-PCR. The genes targeted by miR-146a-5p 
were identified by bioinformatics prediction and experimental techniques.
RESULTS: We found 413 DE lncRNAs between DPN and T2DM rats (|log2FC| ≥ 2 and 
adjust P ≤ 0.05). Eight DE lncRNAs were predicted to bind to miR-146a-5p by both 
algorithms, of which four were verified by qRT-PCR. TRAF6, IRAK1, and SMAD4 were 
identified as miR-146a-5p targeted genes and were predominantly enriched in the 
inflammatory signaling pathway.

problem, with no efficient targeted treatments for these wound disorders. 
Curcumin is well confirmed to improve diabetic wound healing, however, its low 
bioavailability and poor solubility severely limit its clinical application. 
This study aims to provide the pharmacological basis for the use of 
(2E,6E)-2,6-bis(2-(trifluoromethyl)benzylidene)cyclohexanone (C66). The results 
showed that topically applied C66 improved cutaneous wound healing in vivo. 
Further studies showed that C66 treatment increased the level of microRNA-146a 
(miR-146a) in the wounds in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice, 
downregulated the expression of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1) and phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 subunit (p-p65) (both p 
< 0.05), and suppressed the mRNA expression of inflammation-related cytokines, 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). 
The in vitro data obtained in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) 
showed that C66 could reverse high glucose (HG)-induced NF-κB activation due to 
upregulation of miR-146a expression, which matched the in vivo findings. In 
conclusion, the present study indicates that C66 exerts anti-inflammation 
activity and accelerates skin wound healing of diabetic mice, probably via 
increasing miR-146a and inhibiting the NF-κB-mediated inflammation pathway. 
Therefore, C66 may be a promising alternative for the treatment of diabetic 
wounds.","DOI: 10.3390/molecules25040920

investigate the possible roles of LCs, pDCs and toll-like receptor (TLR)7/9 
signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of VV, we detected the expression of 
CD1a, CD2AP, CD123, TLR7/9, IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), and interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) in VV lesions.The expression of CD1a, 
CD2AP, CD123, TLR7/9, IRF7, and IRAK1 in 20 VV lesions was tested by 
immunohistochemistry. The density and number of stained cells were compared 
between VV lesions and the perilesional normal skin.The density and number of 
CD1a-, CD2AP-, CD123-, TLR9-, and IRAK1-positive cells in the papillary layer of 
VV lesions were significantly higher than those in the perilesional normal skin 
(P < .05). There were no significant differences in the density and positive 
rate of CD1a+ cells in the epidermis and of TLR7 and IRF7 cells in the dermis 
between VV lesions and the perilesional normal skin at the edge (P > .05).In VV, 
the number of LCs increases only in the dermis, indicating that LC's 
antigen-presenting function might not be inhibited. The increased number of pDCs 
in VV lesions suggests that HPV infection may recruit the pDCs to the 
virus-infected epithelium. We speculate that the TLR7/9 downstream signaling 
pathway is not fully activated in VV, leading to difficulty of HPV removal and 
the relapse of HPV-infected lesions.","DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019214

results in multiple organ dysfunction. Sepsis accounts for high mortality and 
morbidity among newborns worldwide. Narciclasine is a plant alkaloid which has 
shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we investigated the 
effect and mechanism of action of narciclasine in neonatal sepsis rat models. 
The excessive release of S100A8/A9 or calprotectin in neonatal sepsis could be 
detrimental as it could exacerbate the inflammatory responses. We found that 
narciclasine significantly reduced the plasma levels of S100A8/A9 and also 
suppressed its expression in the liver and lung. The systemic and local 
bacterial load was also reduced in the narciclasine treated rats. The systemic 
and local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma and organs (liver 
and lungs) was significantly reduced in the narciclasine treated rats. The 
histopathological studies showed that narciclasine prevents the organ damage 
associated with sepsis and improved the survival of neonatal rats. Sepsis 
increased the phosphorylated NF-κβ p65 protein expression in the liver. 
Narciclasine suppressed the phosphorylation of NF-κβ p65 and the degradation of 
NF-κβ inhibitory protein alpha. It could also suppress the expression of adaptor 
proteins of the toll like receptor signaling pathway viz., myeloid 
differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1) and TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). These results suggest that 
narciclasine protects against sepsis in neonatal rats through the inhibition of

synovial joints, play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) has been proposed to be a master regulator of 
bone remodeling in inflammatory arthritis. Here, potential impairation on the 
activity of FLSs derived from RA to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting 
DKK-1 was investigated.
METHODS: siRNAs targeting DKK-1 were transfected into FLSs of patients with RA. 
Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP3, MMP9, 
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, TGF-β2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 
(MCP)-1 levels in the cell culture supernatant were detected by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Invasion assay and H incorporation assay were 
utilized to investigate the effects of siRNAs targeting DKK-1 on FLSs invasion 
and cell proliferation, respectively. Western blotting was performed to analyze 
the expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase (IRAK)1, extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)1, Jun N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) and β-catenin in FLSs.
RESULTS: DKK-1 targeting siRNAs inhibited the expression of DKK-1 in FLSs 
(P < 0.01). siRNAs induced a significant reduction of the levels of IL-6, IL-8, 
MMP2, MMP3 and MMP9 in FLSs compared to the control group (P < 0.05). DKK-1 
targeting siRNAs inhibited the proliferation and invasion of FLSs (P < 0.05). 
Important molecules of pro-inflammatory signaling in FLSs, including IRAK1 and 
ERK1, were decreased by the inhibition of DKK-1 in FLSs. In contrast, β-catenin, 
a pivotal downstream molecule of the Wnt signaling pathway was increased.
CONCLUSIONS: By inhibiting DKK-1, we were able to inhibit the proliferation, 
invasion and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion of FLSs derived from RA, which 
was mediated by the ERK or the IRAK-1 signaling pathway. These data indicate the 
application of DKK-1 silencing could be a potential therapeutic approach to RA.","DOI: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000697

which despite the known cause, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and many 
decades of successful therapy, remains one of the leading global health 
problems. Immune responses against Mtb infection involve both of types of 
immunity, but cellular immunity, in which certain cytokines and Th1 cells play a 
key role, is crucial. A better understanding of the functions of the cytokine 
network involved in the state and progression of TBC could identify specific 
molecular markers for monitoring of disease activity as well as therapy outcomes 
in TBC patients.
METHODOLOGY: We investigated expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IRAK1 genes using an 
RT-qPCR technique in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 33 TBC patients and 
10 healthy individuals.
RESULTS: Comparison between TBC patients and healthy individuals revealed 
statistically significant differences for all analyzed genes. The levels of 
expression of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA were higher, while the level of IRAK1 mRNA was 
lower in the TBC group compared to controls. Moreover, a strong positive 
correlation was observed between TNF-α and IL-6 gene expression. When clinical 
parameters were analyzed, increased levels of TNF-α mRNA were detected in 
patients with a longer duration of therapy (>2 months) compared to those with a 
shorter therapy duration (< 2 months), and in patients without anemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the inflammatory genes we examined play a 
crucial role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, and that the expression of the 
TNF-α gene could be a marker for monitoring the clinical effect of the 
ant-tuberculosis drugs during therapy.","Copyright (c) 2019 Ivana Buha, Vesna Skodric-Trifunovic, Tatjana

promising tool for the repair of acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by cisplatin 
and ischemia/reperfusion. However, the roles of hucMSC-Ex in sepsis-associated 
AKI repair and its mechanism are largely unknown. Hence, we constructed a sepsis 
model through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), testing the benefits of 
hucMSC-Ex in the sepsis in terms of survival rate, serum renal markers levels, 
morphological changes and apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry staining and 
immunofluorescence assay were used to investigate the role of NF-κB activity in 
the repair of sepsis-associated AKI with hucMSC-Ex. HK-2 cells were transfected 
with microRNA-146b (miR-146b) mimics and inhibitors, respectively, and the 
regulatory effect of miR-146b on NF-κB activity was studied. We found that 
hucMSC-Ex treatment significantly decreased the serum creatinine (Cr) and blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, ameliorated the morphological damage and inhibited 
renal tubular cells apoptosis. More importantly, the survival rate at 72 h was 
28% in CLP group and 45% in hucMSC-Ex group, respectively. Treatment with 
hucMSC-Ex improved survival in mice with sepsis. These effects of hucMSC-Ex were 
mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB activity and the lessening of 
pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, hucMSC-Ex significantly increased 
miR-146b expression in kidney tissues. Conversely, interleukin (IL)-1 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) level, which is the target gene of miR-146b, 
clearly decreased in hucMSC-Ex group. In brief, this study showed that treatment 
with hucMSC-Ex decreased IRAK1 expression through the up-regulation of miR-146b 
level, led to the inhibition of NF-κB activity, and eventually alleviated 
sepsis-associated AKI and improved survival in mice with sepsis. HucMSC-Ex may 
be a novel therapeutic agent for the reduction of sepsis-associated AKI.","DOI: 10.1007/s10529-020-02831-2

also contribute to immunopathology. Activation of DCs upon the sensing of 
pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is largely mediated by pattern 
recognition receptor/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling and depends on the 
appropriate ubiquitination of the respective signaling molecules. However, the 
ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes involved and their interactions are 
only incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that the deubiquitinase OTU 
domain, ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1 (OTUB1) is upregulated in DCs upon murine 
Toxoplasma gondii infection and lipopolysaccharide challenge. Stimulation of DCs 
with the TLR11/12 ligand T. gondii profilin and the TLR4 ligand 
lipopolysaccharide induced an increase in NF-κB activation in OTUB1-competent 
cells, resulting in elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12, and tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) production, which was also observed upon the specific stimulation 
of TLR2, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9. Mechanistically, OTUB1 promoted NF-κB activity in 
DCs by K48-linked deubiquitination and stabilization of the E2-conjugating 
enzyme UBC13, resulting in increased K63-linked ubiquitination of IRAK1 (IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1) and TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6). 
Consequently, DC-specific deletion of OTUB1 impaired the production of 
cytokines, in particular IL-12, by DCs over the first 2 days of T. gondii 
infection, resulting in the diminished production of protective interferon-γ 
(IFN-γ) by natural killer cells, impaired control of parasite replication, and, 
finally, death from chronic T. encephalitis, all of which could be prevented by 
low-dose IL-12 treatment in the first 3 days of infection. In contrast, impaired 
OTUB1-deficient DC activation and cytokine production by OTUB1-deficient DCs 
protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced immunopathology. Collectively, 
these findings identify OTUB1 as a potent novel regulator of DCs during 
infectious and inflammatory diseases.","DOI: 10.1038/s41423-020-0362-6

Lam., T. puber Blume, and Modecca bracteata, is a vine belonging to the 
Cucurbitaceae family (English name: redball snake gourd). Distributed in China, 
South and East Asia, and tropical Australia, it has been traditionally used as a 
medicinal plant for its antifever, laxative, anthelmintic properties and for 
migraine treatment. In this paper, we examined the effects of Trichosanthes 
tricuspidata Lour. ethanol extract (Tt-ME) in vitro and in vivo. To confirm the 
effects of Tt-ME on inflammatory responses, we conducted experimental analyses 
including level of nitric oxide (NO) production, RT-PCR, and immunoblotting and 
using a HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis animal model. Tt-ME attenuated the release of 
NO and decreased mRNA levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, and IL-6 in 
lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced macrophages in a concentration-dependent 
manner. Tt-ME time-dependently suppressed nuclear translocation of nuclear 
factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunits p50 and p65, activator protein (AP-1) subunits 
c-Fos and c-Jun, and STAT3 transcriptional activity by inhibiting nuclear 
translocation of p50, p65, c-Fos, c-Jun, and STAT3. Tt-ME significantly 
downregulated NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK2 signaling by targeting Syk, Src, and IRAK1 
protein kinases. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression and 
cell migration were observed to be downregulated by Tt-ME in LPS-activated 
macrophages. In vivo studies on Tt-ME also produced similar trends in 
Hcl/EtOH-induced gastritis mouse models by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines

antiviral responses to different viruses. Our previous study has shown that the 
ribonuclease UL41 of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can degrade the mRNA of 
viperin to promote HSV-1 replication. However, it is not clear whether other 
HSV-1 encoded proteins can regulate the function of viperin. Here, one novel 
viperin associated protein, glycoprotein D (gD), was identified. To verify the 
interaction between gD and viperin, gD and viperin expression plasmids were 
firstly co-transfected into COS-7 cells, and fluorescence microscope showed they 
co-localized at the perinuclear region, then this potential interaction was 
confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. Moreover, confocal 
microscopy demonstrated that gD and viperin co-localized at the Golgi body and 
lipid droplets. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter and Co-IP assays showed gD 
and viperin interaction leaded to the increase of IRF7-mediated IFN-β expression 
through promoting viperin and IRAK1 interaction and facilitating K63-linked 
IRAK1 polyubiquitination. Nevertheless, gD inhibited TRAF6-induced NF-κB 
activity by decreasing the interaction of viperin and TRAF6. In addition, gD 
restrained viperin-mediated interaction between IRAK1 and TRAF6. Eventually, gD 
and viperin interaction was corroborated to significantly inhibit the 
proliferation of HSV-1. Taken together, this study would open up new avenues 
toward delineating the function and physiological significance of gD and viperin 
during HSV-1 replication cycle.","Copyright © 2019 Li, Liao, Xu, Zou, Wang, Peng, Li, Ou, Deng, Guo, Gan, Peng,

and has been implicated in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. In our study, we 
investigated the association between miR-SNP rs2910164 and OA susceptibility and 
its role on the expression of miR-146a, inflammatory and catabolic mediators in 
osteoarthritic chondrocytes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genetic association analysis was performed in 1688 knee 
OA patients and healthy individuals of Greek origin. Genomic DNA was extracted 
from blood and genotyped for rs2910164 (G > C) using Restriction-Fragment Length 
Polymorphism (RFLP). Total RNA was extracted from chondrocytes of 18 OA patients 
and miR-146a, IL-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 1 (IRAK-1), TNF 
Receptor-Associated Factor 6 (TRAF-6), A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with 
Thrombospondin Motifs 5 (ADAMTS-5), Matrix Metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), 
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1 Beta (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha 
(TNF-α) expression was evaluated using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR).
RESULTS: OA patients carrying rs2910164-GC and CC genotypes did not have an 
increased risk for OA development compared to GG genotype carriers. MiR-146a 
expression in OA chondrocytes was significantly lower in patients with 
rs2910164-GC genotype than in the GG carriers. OA patients carrying the 
rs2910164-GC genotype in their chondrocytes exhibited increased IRAK-1, TRAF-6, 
MMP-13, IL-1β and IL-6 expression levels compared with rs2910164-GG carriers.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate, for the first time, that miR-SNP rs2910164 in 
miR-146a gene is associated with reduced miR-146a and increased inflammatory and 
catabolic mediators' expression in OA chondrocytes. Our data imply that genetic 
variations in miRNAs linked to OA pathogenesis may regulate their expression 
levels, suggesting new therapeutic strategies for patients with cartilage 
diseases.","Copyright © 2019 Medical University of Bialystok. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

little is known on genetic susceptibility to SSc-associated interstitial lung 
disease (SSc-ILD). A number of common polymorphisms have been associated with 
SSc-ILD, but most have not been replicated in separate populations. Four SNPs in 
IRF5, and one in each of STAT4, CD226 and IRAK1, selected as having been 
previously the most consistently associated with SSc-ILD, were genotyped in 612 
SSc patients, of European descent, of whom 394 had ILD. The control population 
(n = 503) comprised individuals of European descent from the 1000 Genomes 
Project. After Bonferroni correction, two of the IRF5 SNPs, rs2004640 (OR (95% 
CI)1.30 (1.10-1.54), pcorr = 0.015) and rs10488631 (OR 1.48 (1.14-1.92), 
pcorr = 0.022), and the STAT4 SNP rs7574865 (OR 1.43 (1.18-1.73), 
pcorr = 0.0015) were significantly associated with SSc compared with controls. 
However, none of the SNPs were significantly different between patients with 
SSc-ILD and controls. Two SNPs in IRF5, rs10488631 (OR 1.72 (1.24-2.39), 
pcorr = 0.0098), and rs2004640 (OR 1.39 (1.11-1.75), pcorr = 0.03), showed a 
significant difference in allele frequency between controls and patients without 
ILD, as did STAT4 rs7574865 (OR 1.86 (1.45-2.38), pcorr = 6.6 × 10-6). A 
significant difference between SSc with and without ILD was only observed for 
STAT4 rs7574865, being less frequent in patients with ILD (OR 0.66 (0.51-0.85), 
pcorr = 0.0084). In conclusion, IRF5 rs2004640 and rs10488631, and STAT4 
rs7574865 were significantly associated with SSc as a whole. Only STAT4 
rs7574865 showed a significant difference in allele frequency in SSc-ILD, with 
the T allele being protective against ILD.Key points• We confirm the 
associations of the IRF5 SNPs rs2004640 and rs10488631, and the STAT4 SNP 
rs7574865, with SSc as a whole.• None of the tested SNPs were risk factors for 
SSc-ILD specifically.• The STAT4 rs7574865 T allele was protective against the 
development of lung fibrosis in SSc patients.• Further work is required to 
understand the genetic basis of lung fibrosis in association with scleroderma.","DOI: 10.1007/s10067-019-04922-6

via microglial cells can induce the occurrence and development of 
neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects 
of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex-SP) on chemokine and cytokine secretion 
in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglial cells. LPS markedly enhanced 
the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors such as regulated on activation, 
normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), transforming growth factor 
beta-β1 (TGF-β1) and nitric oxide (NO), but decreased the production of 
macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in BV-2 
microglial cells. Furthermore, LPS increased BV-2 microglial cell migration. 
However, Dex-SP treatment had the opposite effect, dampening the secretion of 
RANTES, TGF-β1, and NO, while increasing the production of MIP-1α and IL-10 and 
blocking migration of LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells. Furthermore, Dex-SP 
markedly suppressed the LPS-induced degradation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-4, and 
blocked the activation in TRAF6, p-TAK1, and p-JNK in BV-2 microglial cells. 
These results showed that Dex-SP inhibited the neuroinflammatory response and 
migration in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia by inhibiting the secretion of RANTES, 
TGF-β1, and NO and increasing the production of MIP-1α and IL-10. The molecular 
mechanism of Dex-SP may be associated with inhibition of TRAF6/TAK-1/JNK

pathways, but their function appears inconsistent between Drosophila, bony 
fishes, and vertebrates. This causes a difficulty to understand the IRAK 
functions. As a step to reveal the evolution of IRAKs, in this study, we 
performed comparative and functional analysis of IRAKs by exploiting the 
amphioxus, a pivotal taxon connecting invertebrates and vertebrates. Sequence 
and phylogenetic analysis indicated three major IRAK lineages: IRAK1/2/3 is a 
vertebrate-specific lineage, IRAK4 is an ancient lineage conserved between 
invertebrate and vertebrates, and Pelle is another ancient lineage that is 
preserved in protostomes and invertebrate deuterostomes but lost in vertebrate 
deuterostomes. Pelle is closer neither to IRAK4 nor to IRAK1/2/3, hence 
suggesting no clear functional analogs to IRAK1/2/3 in nonvertebrates. 
Functional analysis showed that both amphioxus IRAK4 and Pelle could suppress 
NF-κB activation induced by MyD88 and TRAF6, which are unlike mammalian and 
Drosophila IRAKs, but, surprisingly, similar to bony fish IRAK4. Also unlike 
Drosophila IRAKs, no interaction was detected between amphioxus IRAK4 and Pelle, 
although both of them were shown capable of binding MyD88. These findings, 
together with previous reports, show that unlike other signal transducers in the 
TLR/IL-1R pathways, such as MyD88 and TRAF6, the functions of IRAKs are highly 
variable during evolution and very specialized in different major animal taxa. 
Indeed, we suggest that the functional variability of IRAKs might confer 
plasticity to the signal transduction of the TLR/IL-1R pathways, which in return 
helps the species to evolve against the pathogens.","Copyright © 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900222

transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), are protein kinases 
essential for transducing inflammatory signals from interleukin receptors. IRAK 
family proteins and TAK1 have high sequence identity within the ATP-binding 
pocket, limiting the development of highly selective IRAK-1/4 or TAK1 
inhibitors. Beyond kinase activity, IRAKs and TAK1 act as molecular scaffolds 
along with other signaling proteins, complicating the interpretation of 
experiments involving knockin or knockout approaches. In contrast, 
pharmacological manipulation offers the promise of targeting catalysis-mediated 
signaling without grossly disrupting the cellular architecture. Recently, we 
reported the discovery of takinib, a potent and highly selective TAK1 inhibitor 
that has only marginal activity against IRAK-4. On the basis of the TAK1-takinib 
complex structure and the structure of IRAK-1/4, here we defined critical 
contact sites of the takinib scaffold within the nucleotide-binding sites of 
each respective kinase. Kinase activity testing of takinib analogs against 
IRAK-4 identified a highly potent IRAK-4 inhibitor (HS-243). In a kinome-wide 
screen of 468 protein kinases, HS-243 had exquisite selectivity toward both 
IRAK-1 (IC50 = 24 nm) and IRAK-4 (IC50 = 20 nm), with only minimal 
TAK1-inhibiting activity (IC50 = 0.5 μm). Using HS-243 and takinib, we evaluated 
the consequences of cytokine/chemokine responses after selective inhibition of 
IRAK-1/4 or TAK1 in response to lipopolysaccharide challenge in human rheumatoid

myocardial ischemia or dermal wound healing. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs 
and important regulators of angiogenesis under physiological and pathological 
disease states. Therefore, identification of microRNAs that may restore impaired 
angiogenesis in response to tissue injury may provide new targets for therapy. 
Using a microRNA microarray profiling approach, we identified a human-specific 
microRNA, miR-4674, that was significantly decreased in patients after 
myocardial tissue injury and had an endothelial cell (EC)-enriched expression 
pattern. Functionally, overexpression of miR-4674 markedly attenuated EC 
proliferation, migration, network tube formation, and spheroid sprouting, 
whereas blockade of miR-4674 had the opposite effects. Transcriptomic profiling, 
gene set enrichment analyses, bioinformatics, 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) 
reporter and microribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (miRNP-IP) assays, and 
small interfering RNA dependency studies revealed that miR-4674 regulates VEGF

angiogenesis, Irak1 and Bicd2 expression, and p38 phosphorylation in human skin

system (CNS), are essential for the maintenance of CNS homeostasis. BAP31, a 
resident and ubiquitously expressed protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, serves 
as a sorting factor for its client proteins, mediating the subsequent export, 
retention, and degradation or survival. Recently, BAP31 has been defined as a 
regulatory molecule in the CNS, but the function of BAP31 in microglia has yet 
to be determined. In the present study, we investigated whether BAP31 is 
involved in the inflammatory response of microglia.
METHODS: This study used the BV2 cell line and BAP31 conditional knockdown mice 
generated via the Cre/LoxP system. A BAP31 knockdown experiment was performed to 
elucidate the role of BAP31 in the endogenous inflammatory cytokine production 
by microglial BV2 cells. A mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
cognitive impairment was established to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of 
BAP31 against neuroinflammation-induced memory deficits. Behavioral alterations 
were assessed with the open field test (OFT), Y maze, and Morris water maze. The 
activation of microglia in the hippocampus of mice was observed by 
immunohistochemistry. Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 
immunofluorescence staining, and reverse transcription quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to clarify the mechanisms.
RESULTS: BAP31 deficiency upregulates LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in 
BV2 cells and mice by upregulating the protein level of IRAK1, which in turn 
increases the translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB p65 and c-Jun, 
and moreover, knockdown of IRAK1 or use of an IRAK1 inhibitor reverses these 
functions. In the cognitive impairment animal model, the BAP31 knockdown mice 
displayed increased severity in memory deficiency accompanied by an increased 
expression of proinflammatory factors in the hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that BAP31 may modulate inflammatory 
cytokines and cognitive impairment induced by neuroinflammation through IRAK1, 
which demonstrates that BAP31 plays an essential role in microglial inflammation 
and prevention of memory deficits caused by neuroinflammation.","DOI: 10.1186/s12974-019-1661-7

for tumor initiation and progression, which is defined as a persistent, high 
rate of gain/loss of whole chromosomes. In the vast majority of human tumors the 
molecular basis of CIN remains unknown. The development of a conceptually simple 
colony color sectoring assay that measures yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) 
loss provided a powerful genetic tool to assess the rate of chromosome 
mis-segregation and also identified 937 yeast genes involved in this process. 
Similarly, a human artificial chromosome (HAC)-based assay has been recently 
developed and applied to quantify chromosome mis-segregation events in human 
cells. This assay allowed identification of novel human CIN genes in the library 
of protein kinases. Among them are PINK1, TRIO, IRAK1, PNCK, and TAOK1. The 
HAC-based assay may be applied to screen siRNA, shRNA and CRISPR-based libraries 
to identify the complete spectrum of CIN genes. This will reveal new insights 
into mechanisms of chromosome segregation and may expedite the development of 
novel therapeutic strategies to target the CIN phenotype in cancer cells.",Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2019.111805

signalling mediators and play pivotal roles in the innate immune and 
inflammatory responses mediated by TLR/IL-1R. In the present study, two IRAK 
family members, OnIRAK1 and OnIRAK4, were identified in the Nile tilapia 
Oreochromis niloticus with a conserved N-terminal death domain and a protein 
kinase domain, similar to those of other fishes and mammals. The gene structures 
of OnIRAK1 and OnIRAK4 are organized into fifteen exons split by fourteen 
introns and ten exons split by nine introns. OnIRAK1 and OnIRAK4 were broadly 
expressed in all of the tissues tested, with the highest expression levels being 
observed in the blood and the lowest expression levels being observed in the 
liver. Both genes could be detected from 2 d post-fertilization (dpf) to 8 dpf 
during embryonic development. Moreover, the expression levels of OnIRAK1 and 
OnIRAK4 were clearly altered in all five tissues after Streptococcus agalactiae 
infection in vivo and could be induced by LPS, Poly I: C, S. agalactiae WC1535 
and △CPS in Nile tilapia macrophages. The overexpression of OnIRAK1 and OnIRAK4 
in 293T cells showed that they were both distributed in the cytoplasm and could 
significantly increase NF-κB activation. Interestingly, after transfection, 
OnIRAK1 significantly upregulated OnMyd88-induced NF-κB activation, while 
OnIRAK4 had no effect on OnMyd88-induced NF-κB activation. 
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays showed that OnMyd88 did not interact with 
either OnIRAK1 or OnIRAK4 and that OnIRAK1 did not interact with OnIRAK4. Taken

receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) are encoded by adjacent X-linked genes and 
recognized for their role in regulation of inflammation. The present case 
control study was conducted to detect the genetic association between MECP2 
(rs1734791) and IRAK1 (rs1059703) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 
susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and the possible 
association of these SNPs and severity of SLE.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients with SLE and 100 healthy controls were 
included in this study. Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics 
(SLICC) criteria were used to classify SLE patients and the activity of the 
disease was assessed by SLEDAI score. Disease severity was assessed by the SLICC 
damage index (SLICC DI). Genetic association of both SNPs with SLE was assessed 
by Taq Man allelic discrimination technique.
RESULTS: Analyses of MECP2 (rs1734791) SNP genotypes revealed that homozygous TT 
genotype was significantly higher in the control group than SLE patients (p < 
0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 0.120). Frequency of allele (A) was significantly 
higher in SLE patients, (p < 0.001, OR = 0.334). SLE patients had significantly 
higher frequency of the homozygous AA and heterozygous AG genotype of IRAK1 
(rs1059703) SNP in comparison to healthy controls (p = 0.0029, OR = 4.17 and 
6.30 respectively). T+G and T+A of rs1734791 and rs1059703 SNPs are protective 
haplotypes (OR = 0.47 and 0.3, p = 0.0046 and < 0.012 respectively). No 
significant association between either SNP and disease activity or severity was 
found.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a possible genetic association between both rs1734791 and

between either SNP and disease activity or severity was detected.","Copyright: © 2019 Narodowy Instytut Geriatrii, Reumatologii i Rehabilitacji w

important role in leukemogenesis. Despite its therapeutic potential, targeting 
NF-κB using pharmacologic inhibitors has proven challenging. Here, we describe a 
myeloid cell-selective NF-κB inhibitor using an miR-146a mimic oligonucleotide 
conjugated to a scavenger receptor/Toll-like receptor 9 agonist (C-miR146a). 
Unlike an unconjugated miR146a, C-miR146a was rapidly internalized and delivered 
to the cytoplasm of target myeloid cells and leukemic cells. C-miR146a reduced 
expression of classic miR-146a targets (IRAK1 and TRAF6), thereby blocking 
activation of NF-κB in target cells. IV injections of C-miR146a mimic to 
miR-146a-deficient mice prevented excessive NF-κB activation in myeloid cells, 
and thus alleviated myeloproliferation and mice hypersensitivity to bacterial 
challenge. Importantly, C-miR146a showed efficacy in dampening severe 
inflammation in clinically relevant models of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
T-cell-induced cytokine release syndrome. Systemic administration of C-miR146a 
oligonucleotide alleviated human monocyte-dependent release of IL-1 and IL-6 in 
a xenotransplanted B-cell lymphoma model without affecting CD19-specific CAR 
T-cell antitumor activity. Beyond anti-inflammatory functions, miR-146a is a 
known tumor suppressor commonly deleted or expressed at reduced levels in human 
myeloid leukemia. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas acute myeloid leukemia data set, 
we found an inverse correlation of miR-146a levels with NF-κB-related genes and 
with patient survival. Correspondingly, C-miR146a induced cytotoxic effects in 
human MDSL, HL-60, and MV4-11 leukemia cells in vitro. The repeated IV 
administration of C-miR146a inhibited expression of NF-κB target genes and 
thereby thwarted progression of disseminated HL-60 leukemia. Our results show 
the potential of using myeloid cell-targeted miR-146a mimics for the treatment 
of inflammatory and myeloproliferative disorders.",© 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.,"DOI: 10.1182/blood.2019002045

(RT), whereby tumor-associated antigens released from irradiated cells unleash 
innate and adaptive attacks on tumors located both within and outside the 
radiation field. RT-induced immune responses further provide actionable targets 
for overcoming tumor resistance to RT (R-RT); immunotherapy (IT) with checkpoint 
inhibitors or Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can markedly improve, if not 
synergize with, RT in preclinical models, and several of these drugs are 
currently investigated as radiosensitizers in patients. In an unbiased 
chemical-genetic screen in a zebrafish model of tumor R-RT, we unexpectedly 
found that Interleukin 1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 1 (IRAK1), a core effector 
of TLR-mediated innate immunity, also functions in live fish and human cancer 
models to counter RT-induced cell death mediated by the PIDDosome complex 
(PIDD-RAIDD-caspase-2). IRAK1 acting both as a driver of intrinsic tumor R-RT 
and as an effector of RT-induced antitumor immunity would, at first glance, pose 
obvious therapeutic conundrums. IRAK1 inhibitors would be expected to sensitize 
the irradiated tumor to RT but simultaneously thwart RT-induced antitumor 
immunity as initiated by stromal dendritic cells. Conversely, TLR agonist-based 
immunotherapy would be expected to intensify RT-induced antitumor immunity but 
at the expense of fueling IRAK1-mediated cell survival in the irradiated tumor. 
We discuss how IRAK1's differential reliance on catalytic activity in the 
radiation vs. TLR responses might help overcome these hurdles, as well as the 
crucial importance of developing IRAK1 inhibitors that lack activity against 
IRAK4, the kinase activity of which is essential for IRAK1 activation in both

investigate about it in rohu (Labeo rohita), one of the economically important 
freshwater fish species in the Indian subcontinent, we cloned, characterized and 
analyzed its expression following bacterial infection and pathogens associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs) stimulation. The full-length cDNA of rohu IRAK1 
(LrIRAK1) consisted of 2765 nucleotide (nt) having an ORF of 2115 nt encoding a

Structurally, LrIRAK1 consisted of twenty-nine helix, twelve strands and forty 
one coils making one N-terminal death domain (19-94 aa) and a central serine 
threonine kinase catalytic domain (or kinase domain) (188-489aa). In addition to 
these two prominent domains, LrIRAK1 also contained highly conserved amino acids 
viz., lysine 215 and aspartic acid 314 and threonine 185, 361 which were 
reported to be important for kinase and phosphorylation activity respectively in 
other animals. Similar to higher vertebrates, LrIRAK1 also consisted of CDK1

aa; NEK6 (NIMA-related kinase 6) at 581-595 aa and AMPK (AMP- activated protein

cave fish, common carp exhibiting high similarity (~95%) and identity (~90%). In 
the uninfected fish, the LrIRAK1 expression was highest in liver (~11.5 fold)

in the treatment of this disease is largely unknown. The purpose of this study 
was to determine whether JP-treated rat serum can inhibit the activation of 
peritoneal macrophages in MRL/lpr mice by downregulating the IRAK1 signaling 
pathway, thereby achieving the effect of improving SLE. The JP-treated rat serum 
was prepared, and the peritoneal macrophages of MRL/lpr lupus mice were isolated 
in vitro, and the effect of JP on cell viability was detected by the CCK8 
method. After LPS induction and shRNA lentiviral transfection, the effect of JP 
on the expression of IRAK1 in cells was detected by immunofluorescence staining. 
The content of TNF-α and IL-6 in the cell supernatant was determined by ELISA. 
The expression of IRAK1, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, and 
the expression levels of IRAK1, p-IRAK1, TRAF6, IKBα, p-IKBα, IKK + IKK, NF-κB,

role of JP in peritoneal macrophages of the MRL/lpr mouse and identified the 
possible mechanisms of action. The results showed that JP could reduce the 
phosphorylation of IRAK1 and its downstream proteins induced by LPS and inhibit 
the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, 
after the transfection of cells with shRNA lentiviral, the results of JP tended 
to be consistent. In conclusion, JP may inhibit the activation of peritoneal

the active ChrXs in white blood cells (WBCs) is unique to females and may 
contribute to sex-biased modulation of the innate immune response. Polymorphic 
differences between the two parental ChrXs may result in ChrX skewing of 
circulating WBCs (ChrX inactivation-ratio (XCI) > 3) driven by differences in 
stem cell selection and activity in the bone marrow or WBC trafficking at the 
periphery. Independent of the mechanism, ChrX skewing may result in 
genotype-phenotype discrepancies. This study aimed to develop an allele-specific 
assay and test its applicability in clinical samples to determine the 
""direction"" of ChrX skewing in the variant IRAK1 haplotype, a common X-linked 
polymorphism with major clinical impacts. Because alternative splice variants of 
IRAK1 are also produced in the region surrounding the critical single-nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP, rs1059703), we also tested the abundance of alternative 
splice variant IRAK1 transcripts. The expression of splice variants IRAK1-B and 
IRAK1-C was about 30 and 50% of the full-length (IRAK1-A) in WBCs from healthy 
subjects (n = 53). IRAK1-A, B, and C showed about 30% lower expression level in 
males (n = 25) than females (n = 28). By contrast, the expression levels of 
IRAK1-A, B, and C were not affected by the variant IRAK1 haplotype in either 
sex. Allele-specific primers generated WT and variant-IRAK1 amplicons with high 
selectivity, and on average produced about half the expression levels of each 
transcript in heterozygous IRAK1-mosaic females. Because injury was shown to 
induce de novo ChrX skewing of WBCs, we tested the directional XCI ratio changes 
in WBC in a sample of trauma patients heterozygous for the variant IRAK1 
haplotype (n = 18). Using the allele-specific assay in combination with the DNA 
methylation status at the polymorphic HUMARA locus, we found that at admission, 
about 60% the patients presented XCI ratios skewed toward WBCs with active ChrXs

aimed to evaluate the effect of swimming exercise on pancreatic expression 
levels of inflammatory cytokines, miR-146a and NF-кB in type-2 diabetic male 
rats.
METHODS: Twenty- eight male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control 
(Con), exercise, diabetes and diabetic exercise (n = 7). Diabetes induction 
performed by the combination of high-fat diet (HFD, 4 weeks) and streptozotocin 
(35 mg/kg. ip). After induction of diabetes, the rats swam in the exercise 
groups for 12 weeks. Then, blood and tissue samples were collected.
RESULTS: Our results indicated a significant increase in expression levels of 
miR-146, NF-κB and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) while a 
significant decrease in pancreatic expression levels of TRAF6 and IRAK1 in 
diabetic group as compared to the control group. In contrast, swimming exercise 
resulted in a significant decrease in expression levels of miR-146a, NF-кB and 
inflammatory cytokines and a significant increase in expression levels of TRAF6 
and IRAK1 in the exercise-diabetic group compared to the diabetic group.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated a significant increase in expression levels of 
miR-146, NF-κB and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) while a 
significant decrease in pancreatic expression levels of TRAF6 and IRAK1 in 
diabetic group as compared to the control group. In contrast, swimming exercise 
resulted in a significant decrease in expression levels of miR-146a, NF-кB and

IL-10-mediated M2c polarization of macrophages. Here, we found that Pellino-1 
attenuated tumor growth by inhibiting M2c polarization of macrophages. Upon 
IL-10 stimulation, Pellino-1-deificient bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) 
showed higher expression of M2c markers, but not M2a, and M2b markers than 
wild-type (WT) BMDMs, indicating that Pellino-1 inhibits M2c polarization of 
macrophages. Pellino-1-deficient BMDMs exhibited a defect in mitochondria 
respiration, but enhancement of glycolysis during M2c polarization. During M2c 
polarization of macrophages, Pellino-1 increased STAT1 phosphorylation via 
K63-linked ubiquitination of IL-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1). 
Furthermore, Lysm-CrePellino-1 fl/fl mice showed enhancement of tumor growth via 
regulating M2c polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. These results

polarization, however, changes in the adipose expression of IRF5 in obesity and 
their relationship with the local expression of proinflammatory 
cytokines/chemokines are unknown. Therefore, IRF5 gene expression was determined 
in the subcutaneous adipose tissue samples from 53 non-diabetic individuals (6 
lean, 18 overweight, and 29 obese), using real-time RT-PCR. IRF5 protein 
expression was also assessed using immunohistochemistry and/or confocal 
microscopy. Adipose gene expression of signature immune metabolic markers was 
also determined and compared with adipose IRF5 gene expression. Systemic levels 
of C-reactive protein and adiponectin were measured by ELISA. The data show that 
adipose IRF5 gene (P = 0.008) and protein (P = 0.004) expression was upregulated 
in obese compared with lean individuals. IRF5 expression changes correlated 
positively with body mass index (BMI; r = 0.37/P = 0.008) and body fat 
percentage (r = 0.51/P = 0.0004). In obese, IRF5 changes associated positively 
with HbA1c (r = 0.41/P = 0.02). A good agreement was found between gene and 
protein expression of IRF5 in obese subjects (r = 0.65/P = 0.001). IRF5 gene 
expression associated positively with adipose inflammatory signatures including 
local expression of TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL-2/5, IL-1β, IL-18, CXCL-9/10, CCL7, 
CCR-1/2/5, TLR-2/7/8/9, IRF3, MyD88, IRAK-1, and inflammatory macrophage markers

macrophages and dendritic cells. Thus, this study gives more insight on the 
impact of the virulent Mtb H37Rv strain on proapoptotic and proinflammatory 
functions of human neutrophils in vitro. We found that neutrophils are not able 
to kill Mtb during the infection process, probably due to the lack of reactive 
oxygen species and nitric oxide production in response to bacteria. However, 
infected neutrophils effectively released cytokines, chemoattractant interleukin 
(IL) 8 and proinflammatory IL-1β. Moreover, Mtb enhanced the early apoptosis of 
neutrophils at 2 h postinfection. Additionally, this proapoptotic and 
proinflammatory response of neutrophils to Mtb infection occurred in an IRAK1- 
and IRAK4-independent manner. We also found that Mtb did not affect the surface 
expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and slightly enhanced the surface 
expression of TLR4, but did not influence mRNA levels of both TLRs during the

induced by high glucose and glucose fluctuations, and the role of miR-146a in 
regulating M1/M2 polarization transitions of microglia. BV-2 cells were cultured 
with 25 mmol/L glucose, 75 mmol/L glucose, and 25 mmol/L-75 mmol/L glucose

lentiviral vector. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
was used to measure mRNA expression of miR-146a, CD11b, iNOS, Arg-1, IRAK1, 
TRAF6, and NF-κB. Immunofluorescence was used to measure CD11b expression. 
Western blot was used to measure protein expression of CD11b, iNOS, and Arg-1. 
Compared with those in the 25 mmol/L glucose control group, expression of CD11b, 
iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the 75 mmol/L glucose or glucose fluctuation groups of 
cultured BV-2 cells were significantly increased, while Arg-1 and IL-10 was 
significantly decreased. These effects were reversed by overexpression of 
miR-146a. Furthermore, expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, and NF-κB was significantly 
increased in the high glucose and glucose fluctuation groups; this was reduced 
after miR-146a overexpression. In sum, high glucose and glucose fluctuations 
induced polarization transitions from M1 to M2 phenotype in BV-2 cells. 
Overexpression of miR-146a might protect BV-2 cells from high glucose and

lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while it upregulates the expression of several 
immune-related genes. We investigated the effect of LL-37 on gene regulation of 
human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), stimulated with or without Porphyromonas 
gingivalis-derived LPS, a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR). LL-37 was 
non-toxic to HGFs up to a concentration of 10 μg/ml. P. gingivalis LPS 
upregulated the expression of IL8, CXCL10, and CCL2, whereas LL-37 reduced this 
upregulation. In absence of LPS, LL-37 itself upregulated the expression of IL8 
and CCL2. LL-37 increased the expression of P2X7, which was constitutively 
expressed in HGFs. The P2X7 antagonist A-438079 suppressed the cytotoxicity and 
upregulatory effect of LL-37 on chemokine response, but not its downregulatory 
effect on P. gingivalis LPS-induced chemokine response. Whether LL-37 alters the 
expression of 29 genes that encode TLR-associated proteins, including TLRs, 
co-receptors, signaling molecules, and negative regulators, in HGFs, under 
stimulation with LPS, was examined. Among TLRs, P. gingivalis LPS upregulated 
the level of TLR4, whereas LL-37 reduced it. In co-receptors, LL-37 
downregulated the level of CD14. Among signaling molecules, LL-37 augmented the 
LPS-upregulated expression of IRAK1. Similar effects were observed in the 
specific negative regulators TNFAIP3, RNF216, TOLLIP, and SIGIRR. Our results

study.
RESULTS: A strong statistically significant difference was observed between 
patients with PTC and controls for IRAK1 rs3027898 variant. When the statistical 
analysis was replicated taking into account patient's sex, the rs3027898 A

significant role of Tβ4 in oligodendrocytes, neurons, and microglial cells in 
neurological recovery, it is suggested that Tβ4 regulates the Toll-like receptor 
(TLR) pro-inflammatory signaling pathway by upregulating miR-146a in 
neurological disorders. However, further investigations on the role of Tβ4 in 
regulating the expression of miR146a and TLR signaling pathway in the immune 
response adjustment in neurological disorders provides an insight into 
mechanisms of action and the possibility of Tβ4 therapeutic effect enhancement.","© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","DOI: 10.1002/jcp.29293

inflammation after entering the bloodstream. Among oral indigenous bacteria, 
Streptococcus sanguinis and S. anginosus are related to systemic disorders, such 
as infective endocarditis and abscess, and are sometimes detected in human 
atherosclerotic plaques or blood. Thus, these oral streptococci may contribute 
to the progression of atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, apolipoprotein 
E-deficient spontaneously hyperlipidemic mice were intraorally challenged with 
S. sanguinis or S. anginosus. Atherosclerotic plaque formation increased 
significantly in the S. sanguinis-challenged group compared with the

proinflammatory cytokines in the aorta and levels of atherosclerosis-related 
mediators in blood increased upon S. sanguinis challenge. Adaptor molecule TNF 
receptor-associated factor 6 was also enhanced in the aorta when mice were 
challenged with S. sanguinis. Furthermore, challenge with S. anginosus induced 
systemic inflammation, but inflammation-related mRNA expression levels in the 
aorta only increased slightly and were accompanied by minimal expansion of the 
lesion area. By contrast, with the exception of IL-1α, the expression levels of 
inflammation-related genes did not change in gingival tissues of both bacteria-

(#)Contributed equally","One of the hallmarks of cancer is chromosome instability (CIN), which leads to 
aneuploidy, translocations, and other chromosome aberrations. However, in the 
vast majority of human tumors the molecular basis of CIN remains unknown, partly 
because not all genes controlling chromosome transmission have yet been 
identified. To address this question, we developed an experimental 
high-throughput imaging (HTI) siRNA assay that allows the identification of 
novel CIN genes. Our method uses a human artificial chromosome (HAC) expressing 
the GFP transgene. When this assay was applied to screen an siRNA library of 
protein kinases, we identified PINK1, TRIO, IRAK1, PNCK, and TAOK1 as potential 
novel genes whose knockdown induces various mitotic abnormalities and results in 
chromosome loss. The HAC-based assay can be applied for screening different 
siRNA libraries (cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, epigenetics, and 
transcription factors) to identify additional genes involved in CIN. 
Identification of the complete spectrum of CIN genes will reveal new insights 
into mechanisms of chromosome segregation and may expedite the development of 
novel therapeutic strategies to target the CIN phenotype in cancer cells.",© 2019 Liskovykh et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.,"DOI: 10.1101/gr.254276.119

interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signaling. However, the post-translational mechanisms 
involved and the role of signaling proteins in this activation are unknown. In 
the present study, we investigated the intracellular signaling mechanisms 
involved in MSU-induced activation of THP-1 macrophages and human nondiseased 
synovial fibroblasts (NLSFs) and the in vivo efficacy of an inhibitor of tumor 
growth factor-β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, in 
MSU-induced paw inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. THP-1 macrophage activation with 
MSU crystals (25-200 µg/ml) resulted in the rapid and sustained phosphorylation 
of interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinase 1 (IRAK1 Thr209) and TAK1 
(Thr184/187) and their association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. At the 
cellular level, MSU inhibited the deubiquitinases A20 and UCHL2 and increased 
20s proteasomal activity, leading to a global decrease in K63-linked 
ubiquitination and increase in K48-linked ubiquitination in THP-1 macrophages. 
While MSU did not stimulate cytokine production in NLSFs, it significantly 
amplified IL-1β-induced IL-6, IL-8, and ENA-78/CXCL5 production. Docking studies 
and MD simulations followed by TAK1 in vitro kinase assays revealed that uric 
acid molecules are capable of arresting TAK1 in an active-state conformation, 
resulting in sustained TAK1 kinase activation. Importantly, MSU-induced 
proinflammatory cytokine production was completely inhibited by 5Z-7-oxozeaenol 
but not IRAK1/4 or TRAF6 inhibitors. Administration of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (5 or 
15 mg/kg; orally) significantly inhibited MSU-induced paw inflammation in 
C57BL/6 mice. Our study identifies a novel post-translational mechanism of TAK1 
activation by MSU and suggests the therapeutic potential of TAK1 in regulating 
MSU-induced inflammation.","DOI: 10.1038/s41423-019-0284-3

kidney injury in mice with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to 
investigate its possible mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 45 female MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided 
into control group, miR-146a mimic group and miR-146a inhibitor group. Urine 
protein level was measured every 2 weeks. Meanwhile, the levels of serum 
anti-dsdeoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA), anti-ssDNA, antinuclear antibody 
(ANA) and anti-chromatin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). At 2 weeks after drug treatment, the effects of miR-146a mimic and 
inhibitor on kidney tissues of MRL/lpr mice were detected and analyzed by gene 
chip and gene set enrichment analysis, respectively. The mice were executed at 
the age of 24 weeks, and the blood samples were collected. Subsequently, the 
level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was measured using the BUN analyzer. After 
that, kidney tissues were taken, and the effect of drug treatment on the 
morphology of kidney tissues was detected via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. 
Moreover, the effects of drug treatment on the mRNA levels of inflammatory 
factors and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in kidney tissues 
were detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and 
Western blotting, respectively.
RESULTS: MiR-146a mimic significantly reduced urine protein in a time-dependent 
manner, which also significantly reduced BUN level at 24 weeks. The results of 
HE staining showed that both glomerular injury and renal vascular injury in 
miR-146a mimic group were significantly alleviated. In miR-146a mimic group, 
serum autoantibodies of anti-dsDNA, anti-ssDNA, anti-chromatin and ANA decreased 
significantly. However, the survival time of mice was significantly prolonged. 
High-throughput gene expression chip technique elucidated that in miR-146a mimic 
group, the expression of positive regulatory gene of NF-κB showed a decreasing 
trend. However, the expression of negative regulatory gene of NF-κB showed an 
increasing trend. MiR-146a mimic remarkably down-regulated the expression levels 
of RELA, IRAK1, interleukin-1B (IL1B) and IL-10 in kidney tissues. Furthermore, 
the results of Western blotting showed that miR-146a mimic inhibited both the 
classical and non-classical NF-κB signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-146a reduces SLE-induced kidney injury in MRL/lpr mice through 
regulating classical and non-classical NF-κB signaling pathways.","DOI: 10.26355/eurrev_201908_18744

    Ann Transl Med. 2020 Apr;8(7):511.","Targeted inhibitors to oncogenic kinases demonstrate encouraging clinical 
responses early in the treatment course; however, most patients will relapse 
because of target-dependent mechanisms that mitigate enzyme-inhibitor binding or 
through target-independent mechanisms, such as alternate activation of survival 
and proliferation pathways, known as adaptive resistance. Here, we describe 
mechanisms of adaptive resistance in FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 
(FLT3)-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by examining integrative in-cell 
kinase and gene regulatory network responses after oncogenic signaling blockade 
by FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i). We identified activation of innate immune stress 
response pathways after treatment of FLT3-mutant AML cells with FLT3i and showed 
that innate immune pathway activation via the interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 and 4 (IRAK1/4) complex contributes to adaptive resistance in 
FLT3-mutant AML cells. To overcome this adaptive resistance mechanism, we 
developed a small molecule that simultaneously inhibits FLT3 and IRAK1/4 
kinases. The multikinase FLT3-IRAK1/4 inhibitor eliminated adaptively resistant 
FLT3-mutant AML cells in vitro and in vivo and displayed superior efficacy as 
compared to current targeted FLT3 therapies. These findings uncover a 
polypharmacologic strategy for overcoming adaptive resistance to therapy in AML 
by targeting immune stress response pathways.","Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American

miR-146a directly inhibited ILC2 function and suppressed ILC2 proliferation both 
in vivo and in vitro. During stimulation of ILC2, miR-146a expression gradually 
increased with a decrease of cell proliferation. Modulation of ILC2 function by 
miR-146a may depend on IL-33/interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1 or ST2) 
signaling through inhibiting IRAK1 and TRAF6.miR-146a can inhibit IRAK1 and

cytogenetic abnormalities detected in hematologic malignancies. To date, 
identification of genes in the del(20q) common deleted region that contribute to 
disease development have remained elusive. Through assessment of patient gene 
expression, we have identified STK4 (encoding Hippo kinase MST1) as a 20q gene 
that is downregulated below haploinsufficient amounts in myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Hematopoietic-specific 
gene inactivation in mice revealed Hippo kinase loss to induce splenomegaly, 
thrombocytopenia, megakaryocytic dysplasia, and a propensity for chronic 
granulocytosis; phenotypes that closely resemble those observed in patients 
harboring del(20q). In a JAK2-V617F model, heterozygous Hippo kinase 
inactivation led to accelerated development of lethal myelofibrosis, 
recapitulating adverse MPN disease progression and revealing a novel genetic 
interaction between these 2 molecular events. Quantitative serum protein 
profiling showed that myelofibrotic transformation in mice was associated with 
cooperative effects of JAK2-V617F and Hippo kinase inactivation on innate 
immune-associated proinflammatory cytokine production, including IL-1β and IL-6. 
Mechanistically, MST1 interacted with IRAK1, and shRNA-mediated knockdown was 
sufficient to increase IRAK1-dependent innate immune activation of NF-κB in 
human myeloid cells. Consistent with this, treatment with a small molecule 
IRAK1/4 inhibitor rescued the aberrantly elevated IL-1β production in the 
JAK2-V617F MPN model. This study identified Hippo kinase MST1 (STK4) as having a 
central role in the biology of del(20q)-associated hematologic malignancies and 
revealed a novel molecular basis of adverse MPN progression that may be 
therapeutically exploitable via IRAK1 inhibition.",© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.,"DOI: 10.1182/blood.2019000170

in pigs, resulting in significant economic losses worldwide. A compelling impact 
of PRRSV infection is severe pneumonia. In the present study, we found that 
interleukin-17 (IL-17) was upregulated by PRRSV infection. Subsequently, we 
demonstrated that PI3K and p38MAPK signaling pathways were essential for 
PRRSV-induced IL-17 production as addition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K) and p38MAPK inhibitors dramatically reduced IL-17 production. 
Furthermore, we show here that deleting the C/EBPβ and CREB binding motif in 
porcine IL-17 promoter abrogated its activation and that knockdown of C/EBPβ and 
CREB remarkably impaired PRRSV-induced IL-17 production, suggesting that IL-17 
expression was dependent on C/EBPβ and CREB. More specifically, we demonstrate 
that PRRSV nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) induced IL-17 production, which was 
also dependent on PI3K-p38MAPK-C/EBPβ/CREB pathways. We then show that Ser74 and 
Phe76 amino acids were essential for nsp11 to induce IL-17 production and viral 
rescue. In addition, IRAK1 was required for nsp11 to activate PI3K and enhance 
IL-17 expression by interacting with each other. Importantly, we demonstrate 
that PI3K inhibitor significantly suppressed IL-17 production and lung 
inflammation caused by HP-PRRSV in vivo, implicating that higher IL-17 level 
induced by HP-PRRSV might be associated with severe lung inflammation. These 
findings provide new insights onto the molecular mechanisms of the PRRSV-induced 
IL-17 production and help us further understand the pathogenesis of PRRSV 
infection.IMPORTANCE Highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory 
syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) associated with severe pneumonia has been one of the 
most important viral pathogens in pigs. IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that 
might be associated with the strong inflammation caused by PRRSV. Therefore, we 
sought to determine whether PRRSV infection affects IL-17 expression, and if so, 
determine this might partially explain the underlying mechanisms for the strong 
inflammation in HP-PRRSV-infected pigs, especially in lungs. Here, we show that 
PRRSV significantly induced IL-17 expression, and we subsequently dissected the 
molecular mechanisms about how PRRSV regulated IL-17 production. Furthermore, we 
show that Ser74 and Phe76 in nsp11 were indispensable for IL-17 production and 
viral replication. Importantly, we demonstrated that PI3K inhibitor impaired 
IL-17 production and alleviated lung inflammation caused by HP-PRRSV infection.

RNA virus that is highly neurotropic. BoDV-1 infection can damage the central 
nervous system and cause inflammation. To survive in host cells, BoDV-1 must 
evade the host innate immune response. A previous study showed that miR-146a 
expression increased in neonatal rats infected with BoDV-1. miR-146a is a 
microRNA suggested to negatively regulate innate immune and inflammatory 
responses and antiviral pathways. Many groups have reported that its 
overexpression facilitates viral replication. However, it is unclear whether 
miR-146a is involved in escape from the host immune response during BoDV-1 
infection.
METHODS: In this study, BoDV-1 was used to infect neonatal rats within 24 h of 
birth intracranially, as well as to infect human microglial cells (HMC3). 
miR-146a expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR. The TargetScanHuman database was 
used to find the target genes of miR-146a. A search of the binding sites of 
miR-146a and its target gene's 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) was also performed 
using RNAhybrid software. The binding sites of miR-146a and the target gene's 
3'UTR were detected by dual luciferase reporter assays. Overexpression and 
suppression studies of miR-146a were performed to determine its effect on BoDV-1 
replication. The relative protein expression of members of the IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB 
signaling pathway was also evaluated by western blotting in HMC3.
RESULTS: After BoDV-1 infection of neurons in vivo and of HMC3 cells, miR-146a 
expression was significantly upregulated. miR-146a overexpression in HMC3 cells 
promoted viral replication, while its inhibition inhibited it. Through the 
TargetScanHuman database, we identified the target genes of anti-inflammatory 
miR-146a: IRAK1 and TRAF6. We also found that BoDV-1 could inhibit IRAK1 and 
TRAF6 expression in HMC3 cells. Moreover, we showed that the inhibition of IRAK1 
and TRAF6 also led to decreases in the expression of P65 and phosphorylated P65 
in the downstream NF-κB pathway. Subsequently, we confirmed the interaction of 
miR-146a with IRAK1 and TRAF6 by luciferase assay.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-146a inhibits the IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB 
signaling pathway to facilitate BoDV-1 survival in host cells.",Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197671

unique to females. We tested this hypothesis in ex vivo lipopolysaccharide and 
phorbol ester-stimulated polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) and monocytes 
from healthy volunteers (n = 51). Observations were analyzed after 
stratification by sex alone or the presence of variant IRAK1 haplotype a common 
X-linked polymorphism with previously demonstrated major clinical impacts. Upon 
cell activation, CD11b, CD45, CD66b, CD63, and CD14 expression was markedly and 
similarly elevated in healthy males and females. By contrast, PMN and monocyte 
activation measured by CD11b, CD66b, and CD63 was increased in variant-IRAK1 
subjects as compared with WT. Stratification by IRAK1 genotype and sex showed 
similar cell activation effect on variant-IRAK1 subjects and an intermediate 
degree of cell activation in heterozygous mosaic females. The increased membrane 
expression of these proteins in variant-IRAK1 subjects was associated with 
similar or increased intersubject but uniformly decreased intrasubject cell 
response variabilities as compared with WT. We also tested white blood cell ChrX 
skewing in the healthy cohort as well as in a sample of female trauma patients 
(n = 201). ChrX inactivation ratios were similar in IRAK1 WT, variant, and

variability and blunted de novo ChrX skewing in response to trauma. A more 
pronounced cell activation of PMNs and monocytes accompanied by decreased

in dairy cow diets. The accepted ""ideal"" ratio of lysine (Lys) to Met (L:M) when 
formulating diets is 3:1. However, blood from cows fed corn silage-based diets 
without supplemental rumen-protected Met averages approximately 3.6:1 L:M. 
Recent in vivo research on cattle immunonutrition has revealed that the immune 
system could benefit from greater Met supply. To study more closely the effects 
of different L:M ratios, blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) were isolated from 
5 Holstein cows in mid-lactation (238 ± 20 d postpartum, 33.8 ± 3.8 kg of 
milk/d; mean ± SD). The PMN were incubated at 3 different levels of L:M (3.6:1, 
2.9:1, or 2.4:1) and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at either 0 or 50 
μg/mL for 2 h at 37°C. Target genes were associated with cytokines, pathogen 
recognition, nuclear receptors, killing mechanisms, and Met and glutathione 
metabolism. Data were subjected to ANOVA using PROC MIXED in SAS, with L:M, LPS, 
and their interaction as fixed effects. Stimulation with LPS upregulated genes 
related to cytokines (IL1B, TNF, IL10 and IL6) and nuclear receptors, including 
nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB1) and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), and 
downregulated the mRNA abundance of chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1), lysozyme (LYZ) 
and glutathione reductase (GSR). A linear decrease was observed in the mRNA 
abundance of TNF when L:M was decreased. A similar response was observed for 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and NFKB1 abundance in cells 
stimulated with LPS (linear effect). A linear increase of LYZ mRNA expression as 
L:M decreased was detected in unstimulated cells. Furthermore, a decrease in L:M 
led to a linear decrease of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mRNA abundance in 
cells challenged with LPS. Overall, LPS challenge triggered the activation of 
isolated PMN from mid-lactation cows. However, data suggest the use of a shorter 
incubation time to capture the peak response and not the resolution of the 
inflammatory response as in the present study. Our results indicate a possible 
involvement of Met in modulating PMN inflammatory and oxidative stress status 
and in helping the resolution of inflammation after initial stimulation.","The Authors. Published by FASS Inc. and Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the American

inhibiting cell viability, suppressing the healing of scratches, inducing cell 
apoptosis, down-regulating Bcl-2 expression and up-regulating Bax, 
cleaved-Caspase-3 and cleaved-Caspase-9 expression, and concurrently increasing 
the concentrations and the protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8. MiR-206 
overexpression aggravated LPS-induced inflammation injury in MRC-5 cells. 
Up-regulation of IRAK1 was observed in miR-206 mimic-transfected cells. 
Moreover, IRAK1 overexpression promoted LPS-induced inflammation injury in MRC-5 
cells. MiR-206 activated MEK/ERK and JNK pathways by regulating IRAK1.

through a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-myeloid differentiation factor 88 
(MyD88)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway that is upregulated 
by sepsis. Pretreatment with the nontoxic immunomodulator monophosphoryl lipid A 
(MPLA) prevents inhibition by LPS through activation of a 
TLR4-TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β 
(TRIF)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway that prevents LPS-induced 
ERK activation. Here, we identified the molecular mechanisms that underlie the 
protective inhibitory interaction between the MPLA-PI3K and LPS-ERK pathways. 
Treatment of mouse MTALs with LPS in vitro increased phosphorylation of IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1, a critical mediator of LPS signaling 
downstream of TLR4-MyD88. Activation of ERK by LPS was eliminated by a selective 
IRAK-1 inhibitor, establishing IRAK-1 as the upstream mediator of ERK 
activation. Pretreatment of MTALs with MPLA in vitro prevented LPS-induced 
IRAK-1 activation; this effect was dependent on PI3K. Treatment of MTALs with 
MPLA increased expression of Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), an inducible 
protein that negatively regulates LPS signaling by inhibiting IRAK-1. The 
MPLA-induced increase in Tollip protein level was prevented by PI3K inhibitors. 
In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, MPLA increased the amount of Tollip stably 
bound to IRAK-1, an interaction that inhibits IRAK-1 activation. These results 
support a mechanism whereby MPLA increases Tollip expression in the MTAL through 
a PI3K-dependent pathway. Tollip, in turn, inhibits LPS-induced TLR4 signaling 
by suppressing activation of IRAK-1, thereby preventing activation of ERK that 
inhibits HCO3- absorption. These studies show that MPLA induces reprogramming of 
MTAL cells that protects against LPS stimulation and identify IRAK-1 and Tollip 
as new therapeutic targets to prevent renal tubule dysfunction in response to 
infectious and inflammatory stimuli.","DOI: 10.1152/ajprenal.00170.2019

hyperglycemia, ineffective insulin use, and insulin resistance and affecting 1 
in 11 people worldwide. Inflammation-related insulin resistance is thought to 
play an important role in the etiology of the disease. TLR4 is the central 
receptor of the natural immune system and has an important role as a trigger of 
the inflammatory response. The IRAK1 and TIRAP are members of the TLR4 pathway 
and involved in the TLR4-mediated inflammatory response. Genetic variants in the 
TLR4 gene or in the IRAK1 and TIRAP genes may have an important role in the 
development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes by disrupting the 
inflammatory response. In this direction, we aimed to investigate the 
relationship among TLR4 and IRAK1, TIRAP gene variants, and type 2 diabetes and 
insulin resistance, and investigate how these variants affect inflammatory 
factors (TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1β).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In our study, a total of seven variations on the genes of 
TLR4 (rs4986790, rs4986791), IRAK1 (rs1059703, rs3027898, rs7061789), and TIRAP 
(rs8177374, rs8177400) were genotyped by the MassARRAY® Iplex GOLD SNP 
genotyping in 100 type 2 diabetic patients and 100 non-diabetic individual. The 
TLR4 rs4986790 and rs4986791 variation was confirmed by PCR-RFLP method also. 
The serum IL1-β, IL6, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels were measured using enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay kits.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: As a result of our study, no correlation was found among 
TLR4, IRAK1, and TIRAP gene variants and the risk of type 2 diabetes and insulin 
resistance. However, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1β levels were also associated 
with diabetes and insulin resistance (p > 0.05). Although the gene variants were 
not significant in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance groups, IRAK1, TLR4, 
and TIRAP gene variants were found to be associated with TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and 
IL-1β levels.","DOI: 10.1007/s00011-019-01263-7

is involved in the recognition of viral and bacterial pathogens. We previously 
showed that in human primary monocytes and monocyte derived macrophages, TLR8 
senses entire Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B 
streptococcus, GBS), resulting in the activation of IRF5 and production of IFNβ, 
IL-12p70, and TNF. However, the quantitative and qualitative impact of TLR8 for 
the sensing of bacteria have remained unclear because selective inhibitors have 
been unavailable. Moreover, while we have shown that TLR2 activation attenuates 
TLR8-IRF5 signaling, the molecular mechanism of this crosstalk is unknown. We 
here used a recently developed chemical antagonist of TLR8 to determine its role 
in human primary monocytes challenged with S. aureus, GBS, Streptococcus 
pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli. The inhibitor completely blocked 
cytokine production in monocytes stimulated with TLR8-agonists, but not TLR2-, 
and TLR4-agonists. Upon challenge with S. aureus, GBS, and S. pneumonia, the 
TLR8 inhibitor almost eliminated the production of IL-1β and IL-12p70, and it 
strongly reduced the release of IL-6, TNF, and IL-10. With P. aeruginosa 
infection, the TLR8 inhibitor impaired the production of IL-12p70 and IL-1β, 
while with E. coli infection the inhibitor had less effect that varied depending 
on the strain and conditions. Signaling via TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5, but not TLR8, 
rapidly eliminated IRAK-1 detection by immunoblotting due to IRAK-1 
modifications during activation. Silencing of IRAK-1 reduced the induction of 
IFNβ and TNF by TLR8 activation, suggesting that IRAK-1 is required for 
TLR8-IRF5 signaling. The TLR-induced modifications of IRAK-1 also correlated 
closely with attenuation of TLR8-IRF5 activation, suggesting that sequestration 
and/or modification of Myddosome components by cell surface TLRs limit the 
function of TLR8. Accordingly, inhibition of CD14- and TLR4-activation during E. 
coli challenge increased the activation of IRF5 and the production of IL-1β and 
IL-12p70. We conclude that TLR8 is a dominating sensor of several species of 
pyogenic bacteria in human monocytes, while some bacteria attenuate 
TLR8-signaling via cell surface TLR- activation. Taken together, TLR8 appears as 
a more important sensor in the antibacterial defense system than previously 
known.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01209

ubiquitin oligomers (also called linear ubiquitin), but the function of the E3

E3 ligase that forms oxyester bonds between the C terminus of ubiquitin and

HOIL-1-generated oxyester bonds to cleavage by hydroxylamine, and macrophages

ubiquitin ligase that initiates the de novo synthesis of polyubiquitin chains

activation are associated with the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
MicroRNA-155-5p (miR155-5p) is one of the most important microRNAs and enables a 
robust inflammatory response. Triptolide (T10) is a natural anti-inflammatory 
component, isolated from a traditional Chinese herb. The objective of the 
current study was to identify the role and potential regulatory mechanism of T10 
in αSyn-induced microglial activation via the miR155-5p mediated SHIP1 signaling 
pathway. Mouse primary microglia were exposed to monomers, oligomers, and 
preformed fibrils (PFFs) of human wild-type αSyn, respectively. The expressions 
of TNFα and IL-1β, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 
qPCR, demonstrated that PFFs initiated the strongest immunogenicity in 
microglia. Application of inhibitors of toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2, TLR4, and 
TLR9 indicated that PFFs activated microglia mainly via the NF-κB pathway by 
binding TLR1/2 and TLR4. Treatment with T10 significantly suppressed PFF-induced 
microglial activation and attenuated the release of proinflammatory cytokines 
including TNFα and IL-1β. Levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, IKKα/β, p-IKKα/β, NF-κB, 
p-NF-κB, PI3K, p-PI3K, t-Akt, p-Akt and SHIP1 were measured via Western blot. 
Levels of miR155-5p were measured by qPCR. The results demonstrated that SHIP1 
acted as a downstream target molecule of miR155-5p. Treatment with T10 did not 
alter the expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6, but significantly decreased the 
expression of miR155-5p, resulting in upregulation of SHIP1 and repression of 
NF-κB activity, suggesting inhibition of inflammation and microglial activation. 
The protective effects of T10 were abolished by the use of SHIP1 siRNA and its 
inhibitor, 3AC, and miR155-5p mimics. In conclusion, our results demonstrated 
that treatment with T10 suppressed microglial activation and attenuated the 
release of proinflammatory cytokines by suppressing NF-κB activity via targeting 
the miR155-5p/SHIP1 pathway in PFFs-induced microglial activation.","DOI: 10.1155/2019/6527638

analysis on the age-related alterations of gene expression profiles in mouse 
germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocytes by means of single-cell RNA-sequencing 
method (scRNA-seq).
METHODS: Two age groups (5-week-old and 32-week-old) female KM mice were used as 
young and old models. Subsequently, GV oocytes were collected for scRNA-seq. The 
bioinformatics was performed to analyze and compare the differences of gene 
expression profile between GV oocytes of young and old mice.
RESULTS: The analysis of scRNA-seq data showed that there were 624 differential 
expressed genes (DEGs) between two age groups of mouse GV stage oocytes. Four 
hundred forty-nine DEGs were up-regulated while 175 DEGs were down-regulated in 
the GV oocytes of the old group. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the genes 
involved in mitochondrial function including oxidative phosphorylation and ATP 
production pathway were significantly down-regulated in GV oocytes of 
32-week-old mice, especially the mitochondrial encoded NADH dehydrogenase 
(mt-Nd), including mt-Nd2, mt-Nd3, mt-Nd4, mt-Nd4L and mt-Nd5. Analysis of DEGs 
revealed that endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes including AdipoR2, 
IRAK-1, RCAN1 and MsrB1 were significantly down-regulated in GV oocytes of 
32-week-old mice. Also, analysis of DEGs demonstrated that 
anti-oxidation-related genes including Erbb3、Rcan1、Gsto2 and Msrb1 were 
significantly down-regulated in GV oocytes of old group.
CONCLUSION: The disorder of mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum stress 
and the reduced antioxidant capability might be involved in the progression of 
oocyte aging. Especially, the down regulation of mitochondrial encoded subunits 
of respiratory chain complexes might play critical roles in the relevant 
mechanisms.","DOI: 10.1186/s13048-019-0529-x

traditional Chinese medicine to counteract symptoms associated with drinking 
alcohol and liver injury and to alleviate inflammatory diseases. Its major 
constituent kakkalide is metabolized to irisolidone by gut microbiota. This 
research study was undertaken to understand the anti-colitis mechanism of 
kakkalide and irisolidone in vitro and in vivo. Kakkalide and its metabolite 
irisolidone inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NF-κB activation and 
TNF-α expression in macrophages. They also inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation 
of IRAK1 and TAK1 and activation of NF-κB by inhibiting the binding of Alexa 
Fluor 488-conjugated LPS in vitro. Orally administered irisolidone or kakkalide 
alleviated colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice with 
2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Their treatments also 
protected epithelial cell disruption and infiltration of CD11b+/CD11c+ cells in 
the colon. Furthermore, they suppressed TNBS-induced expression of M1 macrophage 
markers TNF-α, CD80, CD86, and Arg2 expression while the expression of M2 
macrophage markers Arg1, CD163, CD206, and IL-10 was induced. They also 
suppressed the fecal Proteobacteria population. Overall, the anti-colitic 
effects of irisolidone were superior to those of kakkalide. Kakkalide and its 
metabolite irisolidone inhibited inflammation in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting 
LPS binding to toll-like receptor 4 and gut proteobacteria population.",Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2019.05.008

trastuzumab (Trz), a humanized anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2; ErbB2), is an effective treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. 
However, both agents are associated with cardiac toxicity. Human 
cardiac-resident mesenchymal progenitor cells (CPCs) secrete extracellular 
vesicles including nanosized exosomes which protect against myocardial 
ischaemia. Here, we investigated the effects of these exosomes using a novel 
model of Dox/Trz-mediated cardiotoxicity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CPCs were derived from cardiac atrial appendage specimens 
from patients who underwent heart surgery for heart valve disease and/or 
ischaemic heart disease, and exosomes were purified from CPC conditioned media. 
Proteomics analyses revealed that CPC exosomes contained multiple proteins 
involved in redox processes. Dox/Trz induced a significant increase in reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in rat cardiomyocytes, which was prevented by CPC exosomes. 
In vivo, rats received six doses of Dox (Days 1-11), followed by six doses of 
Trz (Days 19-28). Three doses of either exosomes or exosome suspension vehicle 
were injected intravenously on Days 5, 11, and 19 in the treatment and control 
groups, respectively. Dox/Trz induced myocardial fibrosis, CD68+ inflammatory 
cell infiltrates, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and left 
ventricular dysfunction. CPC exosomes prevented these effects. These vesicles 
were highly enriched in miR-146a-5p compared with human dermal fibroblast 
exosomes. Dox upregulated Traf6 and Mpo, two known miR-146a-5p target genes 
(which encode signalling mediators of inflammatory and cell death axes) in 
myocytes. CPC exosomes suppressed miR-146a-5p target genes Traf6, Smad4, Irak1, 
Nox4, and Mpo in Dox-treated cells. Specific silencing of miR-146a-5p abrogated 
exosome-mediated suppression of those genes leading to an increase in 
Dox-induced cell death.
CONCLUSIONS: Human CPC exosomes attenuate Dox-/Trz-induced oxidative stress in 
cardiomyocytes. Systemic administration of these vesicles prevents Dox/Trz 
cardiotoxicity in vivo. miR-146a-5p mediates some of the benefits of exosomes in 
this setting.","Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

(GM-CSF) can function as an inflammatory mediator, but whether GM-CSF-producing 
CD4+ T cells (TH-GM-CSF) are a distinct T helper cell subset is lacking. Herein 
we demonstrate that interleukin (IL)-1β exclusively drives differentiation of 
naïve CD4+ T cells into TH-GM-CSF cells via inducing ubiquitination of IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and subsequent activation of the 
transcription factor NF-kappaB (NF-κB), independent of RAR-related orphan

the TH17 genetic program, but IL-1β can convert pre-formed TH17 cells into 
TH-GM-CSF cells, thereby accounting for previously reported associations between

miRNAs due to DNA hypermethylation is associated with different pathologies. It 
has also been reported that abnormal expression of miR-140-5p and miR-146a is 
linked to osteoarthritis (OA) progression. In this study, we investigated the 
role of DNA methylation on miR-140-5p and miR-146a expression in OA.
MAIN METHODS: miR-140-5p and miR-146a expression was investigated by qRT-PCR. 
The methylation status of miR-140 and miR-146a regulatory regions was analyzed 
using qMSP and bisulfite sequencing analysis. SMAD-3 and NF-kB binding to 
miR-140 and miR-146a regulatory regions was assessed by ChIP assay and knockdown 
experiments. OA-related genes' expression was evaluated in 5-AzadC, miRNAs 
inhibitor and 5-AzadC/miRNAs inhibitor-treated cells.
KEY FINDINGS: Hypermethylation of specific CpG sites in miR-140 and miR-146a 
regulatory regions was associated with downregulation of miR-140-5p and miR-146a 
in OA chondrocytes and synoviocytes, respectively. 5-AzadC-induced miR-140-5p 
and miR-146a upregulation was observed in OA chondrocytes and synoviocytes. 
Moreover, we found decreased binding affinity of SMAD-3 and NF-kB transcription 
factors on the hypermethylated miR-140-5p and miR-146a regulatory regions, 
respectively. Downregulation of MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 in 5-AzadC-treated OA 
chondrocytes was prevented by miR-140-5p inhibitor transfection. Similarly, 
5-AzadC-treated OA synoviocytes showed decreased expression of IRAK-1, IL1Β and 
IL-6, which was reversed following 5-AzadC-/miR-146a inhibitor treatment.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp), have vital roles on drug resistance in epilepsy. 
Overexpression of P-gp in the brain could reduce the anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) 
concentration in the epileptogenic zone, resulting in drug resistance. Studies 
have demonstrated that recurrent seizures induce the expression of P-gp and 
status epilepticus (SE) could upregulate the expression of P-gp, resulting in

activated in different temporal patterns, such as oscillatory, transient, and 
sustained, can result in distinct gene expression patterns or cell fates. 
However, the molecular events that ensure appropriate stimulus- and 
dose-dependent dynamics are not often understood and are difficult to 
investigate. Here, we used single-cell analysis to dissect the mechanisms 
underlying the stimulus- and dose-encoding patterns in the innate immune 
signaling network. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 
receptor (IL-1R) signaling dynamics relied on a dose-dependent, autoinhibitory 
loop that rendered cells refractory to further stimulation. Using inducible gene 
expression and optogenetics to perturb the network at different levels, we 
identified IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) as the dose-sensing node 
responsible for limiting signal flow during the innate immune response. Although 
the kinase activity of IRAK1 was not required for signal propagation, it played 
a critical role in inhibiting the nucleocytoplasmic oscillations of the 
transcription factor NF-κB. Thus, protein activities that may be ""dispensable"" 
from a topological perspective can nevertheless be essential in shaping the 
dynamic response to the external environment.","Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American

knockout aggravates high-fat diet induced obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic

caused by MVP deficiency are accompanied with increased macrophage infiltration 
and heightened inflammatory responses in the microenvironments. In vitro studies

    Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Jul 05;12:5375.","BACKGROUND: IRAK1 has been shown to be abnormally expressed in a set of tumors 
leading to tumorigenesis and progression. IRAK1 is a therapeutic target that 
drives breast cancer metastasis and resistance to paclitaxel. However, the exact 
role of IRAK1 in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for breast cancer remains 
unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the 
expression of IRAK1 and the clinicopathological parameters and survival 
prognosis of breast cancer patients treated with NCT.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on the clinical data and mRNA microarray data from 
1,085 breast cancer patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas, the correlation between 
IRAK1 expression and clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer was 
analyzed. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of 
IRAK1. The Human Protein Atlas and the String database were used to analyze the 
expression of IRAK1 protein and its interaction with altered neighboring 
proteins in breast cancer. IRAK1 alteration was analyzed in cBioPortal database. 
GEO enrichment of IRAK1 was performed using WEB-based Gene SeT AnaLysis Toolkit.
RESULTS: The expression of IRAK1 was significantly downregulated following NCT. 
The decreased expression of IRAK1 following NCT was positively correlated with 
reduced tumor size. Finally, survival analysis confirmed that a shorter survival 
period was correlated to higher expression of IRAK1 both before and after NCT.
CONCLUSION: These findings advanced our understanding about the expression 
pattern of IRAK1 in breast cancer, especially in those patients who were treated 
with NCT, suggesting that IRAK1 could be used as a prognostic indicator, as well 
as a potential indicator for evaluating NCT efficacy for breast cancer patients.","DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S185662

rhinovirus (RV) infection, a contributor to airway neutrophilic inflammation and 
asthma exacerbations, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly 
understood. Tollip may inhibit IRAK1, a signaling molecule downstream of ST2, 
the receptor of IL-33. This study was carried out to determine whether Tollip 
downregulates ST2 signaling via inhibition of IRAK1, but promotes soluble ST2 
(sST2) production, thereby limiting excessive IL-8 production in human airway 
epithelial cells during RV infection in a type 2 cytokine milieu (e.g., IL-13 
and IL-33 stimulation). Tollip- and IRAK1-deficient primary human 
tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells and Tollip knockout (KO) HTBE cells 
were generated using the shRNA knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, 
respectively. Cells were stimulated with IL-13, IL-33, and/or RV16. sST2, 
activated IRAK1, and IL-8 were measured. A Tollip KO mouse model was utilized to 
test if Tollip regulates the airway inflammatory response to RV infection in 
vivo under IL-13 and IL-33 treatment. Following IL-13, IL-33, and RV treatment, 
Tollip-deficient (vs. -sufficient) HTBE cells produced excessive IL-8, 
accompanied by decreased sST2 production but increased IRAK1 activation. IL-8 
production following IL-13/IL-33/RV exposure was markedly attenuated in 
IRAK1-deficient HTBE cells, as well as in Tollip KO HTBE cells treated with an 
IRAK1 inhibitor or a recombinant sST2 protein. Tollip KO (vs. wild-type) mice 
developed exaggerated airway neutrophilic responses to RV in the context of 
IL-13 and IL-33 treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Tollip 
restricts excessive IL-8 production in type 2 cytokine-exposed human airways 
during RV infection by promoting sST2 production and inhibiting IRAK1 
activation. sST2 and IRAK1 may be therapeutic targets for attenuating excessive 
neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma, especially during RV infection.","© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.","DOI: 10.1159/000497072

(viperin) is a radical SAM enzyme that plays a multifaceted role in the cellular 
antiviral response. Viperin has recently been shown to catalyze the 
SAM-dependent formation of 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP), which inhibits 
some viral RNA polymerases. Viperin is also implicated in regulating 
Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 
(IRAK1) by the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated 
factor 6 (TRAF6) as part of the Toll-like receptor-7 and -9 (TLR7/9) innate 
immune signaling pathways. In these pathways, the poly-ubiquitination of IRAK1 
by TRAF6 is necessary to activate IRAK1, which then phosphorylates downstream 
targets and ultimately leads to the production of type I interferons. That 
viperin is a component of these pathways suggested that its enzymatic activity 
might be regulated by interactions with partner proteins. To test this idea, we 
have reconstituted the interactions between viperin, IRAK1, and TRAF6 by 
transiently expressing these enzymes in HEK 293T cells. We show that IRAK1 and 
TRAF6 increase viperin activity ∼10-fold to efficiently catalyze the 
radical-mediated dehydration of CTP to ddhCTP. Furthermore, we found that 
TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of IRAK1 requires the association of viperin with 
both IRAK1 and TRAF6. Ubiquitination appears to depend on structural changes in 
viperin induced by SAM binding, but, significantly, does not require 
catalytically active viperin. We conclude that the synergistic activation of 
viperin and IRAK1 provides a mechanism that couples innate immune signaling with 
the production of the antiviral nucleotide ddhCTP.",© 2019 Dumbrepatil et al.,"DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.007719

(#)Contributed equally","Neuropathic pain (NP) has complicated pathogenesis as it mainly involves a 
lesion or dysfunction of the somatosensory nervous system and its clinical 
treatment remains challenging. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) model is a 
widely used neuropathic pain model and involved in mechanisms including both 
nerve inflammatory and injury. Cytokines and their receptors play essential 
roles in the occurrence and persistence of neuropathic pain, but the underlying 
mechanisms have not well been understood. Therefore, Interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is chosen to explore the possible 
mechanisms of NP. In the present study, IRAK1 was found to persistently increase 
in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord (SC) during CCI detected by 
western blot. The staining further confirmed that IRAK1 was mainly co-located in 
the DRG astrocytes or SC neurons, but less in the DRG microglia or SC 
astrocytes. Moreover, the region of increased IRAK1 expression was observed in 
superficial laminae of the spinal dorsal horn, which was the nociceptive 
neuronal expression domain, suggesting that IRAK1 may mediated CCI-induced pain 
by nociceptive primary afferent. In addition, intrathecal injection of Toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor or IRAK1 siRNA decreased the expression of IRAK1 
accompanied with the alleviation of CCI-induced neuropathic pain. The 
upregulation of p-NF-κB expression was reversed by IRAK1 siRNA in SC, and 
intrathecal injection of p-NF-κB inhibitor relieved neuropathic pain. Taking 
together, targeting IRAK1 may be a potential treatment for chronic neuropathic 
pain.","DOI: 10.1007/s11064-019-02767-8

IL-36γ regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial 
proteins by gingival epithelial cells (e.g. TIGK cells). Here, we show that 
IL-36γ also regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and 
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), important mediators of 
antimicrobial immunity and tissue homeostasis in mucosal epithelia. MMP9 and 
NGAL were not similarly induced by IL-17 or IL-22, thus indicating the 
importance of IL-36γ in the regulation of MMP9 and NGAL. Mechanistically, MMP9 
and NGAL expression was demonstrated to be induced in an IRAK1- and 
NF-κB-dependent manner. Furthermore, signaling by p38 MAP kinase may enable 
their expression to be independently regulated by IL-36γ. The stronger 
IL-36γ-inducible expression of MMP9 and NGAL in terminally differentiating TIGK 
cells suggests that control of their expression is associated with the 
maturation of the gingival epithelium. Although MMP9 and NGAL expression in 
epithelial cells can also be induced by bacteria, their expression in TIGK cells 
was not induced by the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, most 
likely due to antagonism by the gingipain proteinase virulence factors. This

reduced IRAK1 downregulation of HDAC4 phosphorylation, and attenuated

emerging as key gene regulators playing powerful roles in cancer. Using TCGA

nervous system (CNS) and subsequently to functional deficits. Remyelination 
requires the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into 
myelinating OLs, which in the CNS with neurodegenerative diseases such as 
multiple sclerosis (MS), is often inhibited. Among the inhibitors of OPC 
differentiation are toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) signaling, and both are negatively 
regulated by microRNA-146a (miR-146a). Therefore, we hypothesized that increase 
of miR-146a level in the CNS would foster OPC differentiation and remyelination 
by inhibiting the TLR2/IRAK1 signaling pathway. Here, we tested this hypothesis 
using exogenous miR-146a mimics and a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by immunization with myelin proteolipid protein 
peptide (PLP139-151). EAE mice were treated by miR-146a mimics or miR-146a mimic 
negative controls, respectively, which initiated at day 14 post immunization, 
once a week for 6 consecutive weeks. Neurological function was monitored daily. 
Immunofluorescent staining, qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure the 
differentiation of OPCs and myelination, and to investigate the underlying 
mechanisms of action of miR-146a. Using a fluorescence tracing approach, we 
found that miR-146a mimics crossed the blood brain barrier and targeted OPCs and 
microglia/macrophages after systemic administration. MiR-146a mimic treatment 
substantially improved neurological functional outcome, increased the number of 
newly generated OLs which may facilitate remyelination in the CNS. The cell 
number, cytokine level and protein levels of M2 phonotype of 
microglia/macrophages significantly increased, while cytokine and protein levels 
of the M1 phenotype significantly decreased after miR-146a mimic treatment. 
Increased OPC differentiation and remyelination were associated with reduction 
of TLR2/IRAK1 signaling pathway activity by miR-146a mimic treatment. This study 
provides insight into the cellular and molecular bases for the therapeutic 
effects of miR-146a on OPC differentiation and remyelination, and suggests the 
potential of enhancing miR-146a as a treatment of demyelinating disorders.",Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.nbd.2019.01.019

development and progression of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The aim of 
this work was to study the expression of miRNA146a in FTC and the association 
with clinicopathological features of the disease.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients affected by FTC were included in the study. 
Twenty patients carrying follicular thyroid adenoma (FA) were also enroled as 
the benign counterpart of FTC. Total RNA including miRNA146a was extracted from 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pairs of affected/unaffected tissue and 
its expression was assessed by real-time PCR. Two selected target genes, TRAF6 
(tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) and IRAK1 (Il-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1/2), were also analysed.
RESULTS: miR146a expression in FTC tissue was overall not downregulated in 
malignant versus unaffected tissue, but its expression was inversely correlated 
with clinicopathological features of FTCs at diagnosis. A decreased expression 
of miR146a became apparent in FTC thyroid tissue of widely compared to minimally 
invasive tumours. However, miR146a expression differences between contralateral 
unaffected tissue (extra-FTC) and FTC were not observed regardless of 
clinicopathological features. IRAK1, a known target for miR146a, was upregulated 
in FTC and the increase was mainly appreciable in Hurtle FTC variant. 
Unexpectedly, miR146a did not correlate with TRAF6 showing an inverse trend 
compared to IRAK1 although both genes regulate the activity of nuclear factor- 
kB (NF-kB).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that downregulation of miR146a, 
inversely correlated with clinicopathological features of FTCs at diagnosis and 
suggest a possible involvement of miR146a in FTC development. IRAK1 
over-expression in FTC may be related to tumour development/progression. In 
vitro experiments are needed to support this hypothesis.","DOI: 10.1007/s12020-019-01845-9

complication that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, 
the neuropathogenesis of this complication remains largely unknown. 
Neuroinflammation, in particular hippocampal inflammation, contributes to POCD. 
Recently, increasing evidence has supported the involvement of microRNAs 
(miRNAs) in the regulation of neuroinflammation in human neurological disorders. 
In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-146a, a key regulator of 
the innate immune response, in surgery-induced hippocampal inflammation and 
cognitive impairment. The expression of miR-146a was measured in BV-2 microglial 
cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hippocampal tissues of mice 
with POCD. Loss of function and overexpression studies were performed via 
transfection with miR-146a mimic/inhibitor in cultured BV-2 cell lines and 
intrahippocampal injection of miR-146a agomir/antagomir before 
surgery/anesthesia to identify the role of miR-146a in neuroinflammation and 
cognitive impairment. QPCR, Western blot and ELISA were used to determine the 
expression levels of downstream adaptor proteins and proinflammatory cytokines. 
Immunofluorescence staining was applied to evaluate the activation of microglia. 
Increased expression of miR-146a was observed in BV-2 microglial cells 
stimulated with LPS and hippocampal tissues of mice with POCD. Modulation of 
miR-146a expression via transfection of microglia with miR-146a mimic or 
inhibitor regulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of downstream targets 
of miR-146a (IRAK1 and TRAF6) as well as the release of proinflammatory 
cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6). In addition, overexpression of miR-146a 
attenuated hippocampus-dependent learning and memory impairment in mice with 
POCD, which was accompanied by decreased expression of the IRAK1/TRAF6/nuclear 
factor (NF)-κB pathway and downregulation of microglial activation in the 
hippocampus. Conversely, knockdown of miR-146a expression may exacerbate 
hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficiency and hippocampal 
inflammation in mice with POCD. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the 
important role of miR-146a in the neuropathogenesis of POCD and suggest that 
miR-146a may be a potential therapeutic target for POCD.",Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.bbi.2019.01.020

percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). CME-induced myocardiac inflammation 
is the primary cause of myocardiac injury. Dysregulated miR-142-3p has been 
implicated in multiple cardiovascular diseases and is significantly 
downregulated in CME-induced myocardial injury. However, the role of miR-142-3p 
in CME-induced myocardial injury is unclear. This study herein built a porcine 
CME model by infusing microembolization spheres into the left anterior 
descending branch via a microcatheter, and detected the downregulation of 
miR-142-3p in the myocardial tissues of CME pigs. Echocardiography, hematoxylin 
basic fuchsin picric acid (HBFP) staining, and western blotting of NF-κB p65, 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 showed that the pharmacological overexpression of 
miR-142-3p using agomiR has improved cardiac function and attenuated CME-induced 
myocardiac inflammatory response, while its inhibition using antagomiR 
demonstrated inverse effects. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated IRAK-1 
as a direct target gene of miR-142-3p. Luciferase reporter assays, quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting demonstrated its 
effects in controlling the inflammation of cardiomyocytes. It is noteworthy that 
miR-142-3p was found to be decreased in the plasma of STEMI patients undergoing 
pPCI with no-reflow, indicating a potential clinical relevance of miR-142-3p. 
The receiver-operator characteristic curve indicated that plasma miR-142-3p 
might be an independent predictor of no-reflow during pPCI in patients with 
STEMI. Therefore, overexpression of miR-142-3p acts as a novel therapy for 
CME-induced myocardial injury.","DOI: 10.1038/s41419-019-1341-7

types of cancers. In the present study, the aim was to elucidate the involvement 
of miR-146a-5p in the regulation of human breast cancer (BC) cell growth and 
invasion, as well as the mechanisms underlying its effects. Reverse 
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction results revealed that 
miR-146a-5p was markedly downregulated in BC tissues relative to those of 
adjacent normal tissues. miR-146a-5p expression was also markedly downregulated 
in BC cells. Overexpression of miR-146a-5p significantly suppressed the 
proliferation, invasion and migration of BC MDA-MB-453 and MCF7 cells. 
Furthermore, the results indicated that miR-146a-5p downregulated the expression 
of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) by directly binding to its 
3'-untranslated region in BC cells. Furthermore, IRAK1 expression was observed 
to be markedly upregulated and inversely correlated with miR-146a-5p expression 
in BC tissues. Mechanical studies indicated that restoring IRAK1 expression 
reversed the miR-146a-5p-induced inhibitory effects on proliferation and 
invasion of BC cells. In conclusion, miR-146a-5p may act as a tumor suppressor

remain limited by the single-agent toxicity of traditional radiosensitizers (for 
example, platinums) and a lack of targeted alternatives. In a screen for 
compounds that restore radiosensitivity in p53 mutant zebrafish while tolerated 
in non-irradiated wild-type animals, we identified the benzimidazole 
anthelmintic oxfendazole. Surprisingly, oxfendazole acts via the inhibition of 
IRAK1, a kinase thus far implicated in interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and 
Toll-like receptor (TLR) immune responses. IRAK1 drives R-RT in a pathway 
involving IRAK4 and TRAF6 but not the IL-1R/TLR-IRAK adaptor MyD88. Rather than 
stimulating nuclear factor-κB, radiation-activated IRAK1 prevented apoptosis 
mediated by the PIDDosome complex (comprising PIDD, RAIDD and caspase-2). 
Countering this pathway with IRAK1 inhibitors suppressed R-RT in tumour models 
derived from cancers in which TP53 mutations predict R-RT. Moreover, IRAK1 
inhibitors synergized with inhibitors of PIN1, a prolyl isomerase essential for 
IRAK1 activation in response to pathogens and, as shown here, in response to 
ionizing radiation. These data identify an IRAK1 radiation-response pathway as a 
rational chemoradiation therapy target.","DOI: 10.1038/s41556-018-0260-7

the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase (IRAK)-M, encoded by gene Irak3, negatively regulates toll-like receptor 
signaling by interacting with the MyD88-IRAK-4-IRAK-1 complex and blocking the 
phosphorylation and dissociation of IRAK-1. Its function in the ischemic stroke 
is unknown. Objective: This study aims to investigate whether IRAK-M deficiency 
could exacerbate neuroinflammation and neurovascular injuries during cerebral 
ischemia and reperfusion. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice and Irak3 knockout mice 
were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion and 4 or 24 h of 
reperfusion. Transcription of Irak3 gene was evaluated by quantitative real-time 
PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, infarct volume, neurological score, brain water content, 
and Evans blue leakage were compared between knock-out and wild-type mice after 
reperfusion. Through the observation of gross brain specimen after cerebral 
ischemia, the incidence of hemorrhage transformation was compared between KO and 
WT mice. To explore underlying signaling pathways involved in IRAK-M deficiency, 
major proinflammatory cytokines and NF-κB signaling were measured by qRT-PCR and 
Western blot. Results: The expression of IRAK-M peaked at 1 h after reperfusion, 
and then gradually decreased within the first 24 h, which was abolished by 
blocking the expression of hypoxia induced factor 1α. IRAK-M deficiency 
increased infarct volume, brain edema, the incidence of hemorrhage 
transformation, and the permeability of blood-brain barrier. In addition, the 
NF-κB-mediated expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of 
microglia in the ipsilateral brain from knock-out mice were much higher than 
those in wild-type littermates. Conclusion: IRAK-M deletion exacerbates 
neurovascular damages which are related to the pronounced activation of NF-κB 
signaling and neuroinflammatory responses during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion 
in mice. Our study indicates that IRAK-M has neuroprotective effect and has 
potential to facilitate the development of new pharmaceuticals that reduce 
neurovascular complications.","DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2018.00504

mechanism for modulating gene expression. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs) may be 
tractable targets for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD). In this study miR146a was adsorbed onto poly (glycerol 
adipate-co-ω-pentadecalactone), PGA-co-PDL, nanoparticles (NPs) to reduce target 
gene IRAK1 expression. NPs were prepared using an oil-in-water single emulsion 
solvent evaporation method incorporating cationic lipid 
dioleoyltrimethylammoniumpropane (DOTAP). This resulted in NPs of 
244.80 ± 4.40 nm at 15% DOTAP concentration, zeta potential (ZP) of 
+14.8 ± 0.26 mV and miR-146a (40 µg/ml) maximum adsorption onto 15% DOTAP NPs 
was 36.25 ± 0.35 µg per 10 mg NP following 24 h incubation. Using the MTT assay, 
it was observed that over 75% at 0.312 mg/ml of A549 cells remained viable after 
18 h exposure to cationic NPs at a concentration of 1.25 mg/ml. Furthermore, the 
in vitro release profile of miR-146a from loaded NPs showed a continuous release 
up to 77% after 24 h. Internalization of miR-146a loaded cationic NPs was 
observed in A549 cell lines using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. The 
miR146a delivered as miR-146a-NPs had a dose dependent effect of highest NPs 
concentrations 0.321 and 0.625 mg/ml and reduced target gene IRAK1 expression to 
40%. In addition, IL-8 promoter reporter output (GFP) was dampened by 
miR-146a-NPs. In conclusion, miR-146a was successfully adsorbed onto 
PGA-co-PDL-DOTAP NPs and the miR-146a retained biological activity. Therefore, 
these results demonstrate the potential of PGA-co-PDL NPs as a delivery system 
for miR-146a to treat COPD.",Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejpb.2019.01.002

involved in the acute and chronic inflammatory processes of dental pulp. 
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and IL-8 are two major inflammatory 
mediators. However, the role of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases 
(IRAKs) signaling pathways in responsible for the inflammatory effects of IL-1β 
on dental pulp cells is not clear.
METHODS: Cultured human dental pulp cells were exposed to IL-1β with/without 
pretreatment and co-incubation with IRAK1/4 inhibitor or SB203580 (p38 
inhibitor). IRAK-1 phosphorylation was evaluated by immunno fluorescent 
staining. The protein expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8 were tested by western 
blotting. The secretion of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) and IL-8 was measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: IL-1β stimulated IRAK-1 phosphorylation of pulp cells within 120 min of 
exposure. IRAK1/4 inhibitor attenuated the IL-1β-induced ICAM-1, but not IL-8 
protein expression. IRAK1/4 inhibitor also prevented the IL-1β-induced sICAM-1, 
but not IL-8 secretion. SB203580 showed little effect on IL-1β-induced sICAM-1 
secretion, but effectively inhibited its induction of IL-8 secretion in pulp 
cells.
CONCLUSION: The Results reveal the important role of IL-1β in pulpal 
inflammatory responses via stimulation of IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression and 
secretion. Moreover, IL-1β-induced effects on IL-8 and ICAM-1 are differentially 
regulated by IRAK1/4 and p38 signaling in dental pulp cells. Blocking of IRAKs 
and p38 signaling may have potential to control inflammation of dental pulp in 
the future.","Copyright © 2018 Formosan Medical Association. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Upregulation of IL‑17A is associated with H. 
pylori infection in the gastric mucosa; however, the factors involved in the

pylori‑associated gastritis remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve as key 
post‑transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are associated with the

thymosin-β4 (Tβ4) ameliorates diabetic peripheral neuropathy and whether 
miR-146a mediates the effect of Tβ4 on improved neurovascular function. Male 
Type II diabetic BKS. Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J (db/db) mice at age 20 weeks were treated 
with Tβ4 for 8 consecutive weeks, and db/db mice treated with saline were used

(#)Contributed equally","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of mature B cells driven by 
B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and activated primarily in the lymph node. The 
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib effectively inhibits 
BCR-dependent proliferation and survival signals and has emerged as a 
breakthrough therapy for CLL. However, complete remissions are uncommon and are 
achieved only after years of continuous therapy. We hypothesized that other 
signaling pathways that sustain CLL cell survival are only partially inhibited 
by ibrutinib. In normal B cells, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cooperates 
with BCR signaling to activate prosurvival NF-κB. Here, we show that an 
experimentally validated gene signature of TLR activation is overexpressed in 
lymph node-resident CLL cells compared with cells in the blood. Consistent with 
TLR activation, we detected phosphorylation of NF-κB, STAT1, and STAT3 in lymph 
node-resident CLL cells and in cells stimulated with CpG oligonucleotides in 
vitro. CpG promoted IRAK1 degradation, secretion of IL10, and extended survival 
of CLL cells in culture. CpG-induced TLR signaling was significantly inhibited 
by both an IRAK1/4 inhibitor and ibrutinib. Although inhibition of TLR signaling 
was incomplete with either drug, the combination achieved superior results, 
including more effective inhibition of TLR-mediated survival signaling. Our data 
suggest an important role for TLR signaling in CLL pathogenesis and in 
sustaining the viability of CLL cells during ibrutinib therapy. The combination 
of ibrutinib with a TLR pathway inhibitor could provide superior antitumor 
activity and should be investigated in clinical studies. SIGNIFICANCE: CLL 
relies on the concomitant cooperation of B-cell receptor and Toll-like receptor 
signaling; inhibition of both pathways is superior to inhibition of either 
pathway alone. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT:

proposed for use as adjuvant during immunization with weak immunogens. However, 
its effects on memory T cell function remain largely undefined. Using the murine 
model of acute viral infection, in this paper, we show that in addition to 
augmenting the size of the Ag-specific pool, IL-1 signals act directly on CD8 T 
cells to promote the quality of effector and memory responses. Ablation of 
IL-1R1 or MyD88 signaling in T cells led to functional impairment; both the 
ability to produce multiple cytokines on a per cell basis (polyfunctionality) 
and the potential for recall proliferation in response to antigenic 
restimulation were compromised. IL-1 supplementation during priming augmented 
the expansion of Ag-specific CD8 T cells through the MyD88-IRAK1/4 axis, 
resulting in a larger memory pool capable of robust secondary expansion in 
response to rechallange. Together, these findings demonstrate a critical role of 
the IL-1-MyD88 axis in programming the quantity and quality of memory CD8 T cell 
responses and support the notion that IL-1 supplementation may be exploited to 
enhance adoptive T cell therapies against cancers and chronic infections.","Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800906

innate immune cells phenotype between pro-inflammatory and pro-tolerant states 
when facing a secondary lipopolysaccharide challenge. To determine the molecular 
mechanisms governing this differential response, we propose a mathematical model 
for the interaction between three proteins involved in the immune cell decision 
making: IRAK-1, PI3K, and RelB. The mutual inhibition of IRAK-1 and PI3K in the 
model leads to bistable dynamics. By using the levels of RelB as indicative of 
strength of the immune responses, we connect the size of different primary 
lipopolysaccharide doses to the differential phenotypical outcomes following a 
secondary challenge. We further predict under what circumstances the primary LPS 
dose does not influence the response to a secondary challenge. Our results can 
be used to guide treatments for patients with either autoimmune disease or

characterized by an increased number of M1-like macrophages in the joints. 
Polyphyllin I (PPI), one of the main components in the Rhizoma of Paris 
polyphyllin, displays a selective inhibitory effect on various tumor cells. Here 
we sought to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects and mechanisms of 
PPI on macrophages in vivo and in vitro. Materials and Methods:In vitro, primary 
bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and peritoneal elucidated macrophages 
(PEMs) were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon (IFN)-γ and 
then treated with PPI. We determined the degree of activation of IKKα/β and p65, 
two key mediators of the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway, by measuring their 
phosphorylated forms by Western blot. The p65 nuclear localization was detected 
by immunofluorescent staining. Further, a NF-κB-linked luciferase reporter 
plasmid, as well as those expressing key mediators of the Toll-like receptor 4 
pathway, such as myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), 
interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) associated kinase (IRAK)-1, TNF receptor 
associated factors (TRAF)-6, Transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1 
(TAK1) and p65, were used to identify the mechanism by which PPI achieves its 
inhibitory effects on macrophage-mediated inflammation. Moreover, a NF-κB 
inhibitor, p65-targeted siRNAs, and a p65 plasmid were further used to validate 
the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PPI. In vivo, PPI (1 mg/kg) was administered 
intragastrically one time a day for 7 weeks starting on the 42nd day after the 
first immunization with collagen in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse 
model. Micro-computed Tomography scanning, histological examination, F4/80 and 
iNOS double immunofluorescent staining and CD4 immunohistochemical staining were 
performed to determine the effect of PPI treatment on joint structure and 
inflammation in this model. Results: PPI reduced the inflammatory cytokines 
production of PEMs stimulated by LPS/IFN-γ, inhibited the phosphorylation of 
IKKα/β and p65, and prevented p65 nuclear localization. The NF-κB luciferase 
assay showed that the target of PPI was closely related to the NF-κB pathway. 
Moreover, NF-κB inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p65, and p65 
overexpression eliminated PPI's inhibitory effect. In addition, PPI attenuated 
the bone erosion and synovitis, as well as M1-like macrophage and T cell 
infiltration, in the ankle joint of the CIA model. Conclusion: PPI demonstrated 
effective amelioration of synovial inflammation in the ankle joint of CIA mice 
while suppressing NF-κB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory effectors in 
activated macrophages.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02091

consequences on homeostatic responses. However, little is known about how this 
process is orchestrated. Since proteolysis of critical regulators of NLRP3 
inflammasome contribute to its activation, we aimed to understand how CaSR 
stimulates proteolytic pathways to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. We found 
that proteasome and lysosome-dependent mechanisms are activated by CaSR to 
promote the degradation of important regulators of NLRP inflammasome. The 
pathway involves Gαq/PLC/PKC and Gβγ/PI3K signaling cascades and IRAK1 
ubiquitination. In addition, CaSR stimulates Hsp70 expression activating a 
chaperone-assisted protein degradation that dictates the fate of ASC, NLRP3 
(NOD-like receptor family protein 3), IRAK1 and TRAF6 proteins, turning on the 
NLRP3 inflammasome. In response to CaSR signaling, these proteins are degraded 
through the combination of CUPS (chaperone-assisted ubiquitin proteasome 
pathway) and CAEMI (chaperone-assisted endosomal microautophagy) systems being 
integrated by autophagosomes (chaperone-assisted macroautophagy, CAMA), as 
indicated by LC3-II, a classical marker for autophagy, that is induced in the 
process. Furthermore, CaSR triggers the proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1β 
(IL-1β, 31 kDa) into mature IL-1β (IL-1β, 17 kDa), via the proteasome. Taken 
together, our results indicate that CaSR promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation 
and proteolytic maturation of IL-1β by inducing CUPS and CAEMI, 
chaperone-assisted degradation pathways. Overall, these results support the 
inclusion of CaSR as an activator of homeostasis-altering molecular processes.",Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.028

unknown etiology. Numerous studies have indicated that the disease heterogeneity 
implies various genetic abnormalities. Considering that SSc is characterized by 
a strong sex bias and that the position of IRAK1 gene is on the X chromosome, we 
assume that variations in IRAK1 gene could explain female predominance of SSc. 
It was previously described that miR-146a has a role in 'fine-tuning' regulation 
of the TLR/NF-kB signaling pathway through down-regulation of IRAK1 gene. The 
aim of the present study was to analyze both variants and expression level of 
IRAK1 and miR-146a genes in terms of susceptibility to SSc and clinical 
presentation of SSc patients. We analyzed variants IRAK1 rs3027898 C > A and 
miR-146a rs2910164 C > G in 102 SSc patients and 66 healthy subjects. Genotyping 
was performed by Sanger sequencing. Expression level of IRAK1 mRNA and miR-146a 
in PBMCs was performed in subset of 50 patients and 13 healthy controls by 
RT-qPCR. Our results showed that there was no association between IRAK1 
rs3027898 and the risk of SSc in women. However, the analysis of genotype 
distribution of the mir-146a rs2910164 C > G variant indicated that CC genotype 
shows strong association with lung fibrosis and active form of the disease. When 
expression level of IRAK1 gene was analyzed, we detected significant 
downregulation of IRAK1 mRNA in SSc patients compared to controls, as well as in 
male compared to female patients, in patients with ACAs autoantibodies and in 
patients with severe skin involvement. Regarding the expression level of 
miR-146a, we have found significantly reduced expression in SSc patients, in 
patients with skin involvement and in male SSc patients. The results from this 
study indicate that expression of IRAK1 gene could explain phenotypic 
heterogeneity of SSc and may be involved in the pathogenesis of SSc due to its 
differential expression in certain subgroups. Our results also suggested that 
miR-146a rs2910164 CC genotype may be predisposing factor for development lung 
fibrosis and more progressive form of SSc. Results from relative expression 
analysis of miR-146a demonstrated that changes in the level of this miRNA may 
have an impact on development and clinical course of SSc.","Copyright © 2018 European Federation of Immunological Societies. Published by

regulation of microRNAs (miRs), potential new targets in diabetes treatment. 
Insulin-producing INS1 cells were cultured with or without the broad-spectrum

examined by qRT-PCR. miR-146a-5p was strongly regulated by cytokines and KDACi 
and was analyzed further. miR-146a-5p expression was induced by cytokines in rat

largely unknown. Here, we report that mice deficient in Peli1 (Peli1-/-) were 
more resistant to lethal West Nile virus (WNV) infection and exhibited reduced 
viral loads in tissues and attenuated brain inflammation. Peli1 mediates 
chemokine and proinflammatory cytokine production in microglia and promotes T

for WNV entry and replication in mouse macrophages and mouse and human neurons 
and microglia. It was also highly expressed on WNV-infected neurons and adjacent 
inflammatory cells from postmortem patients who died of acute WNV encephalitis. 
WNV passaged in Peli1-/- macrophages or neurons induced a lower viral load and 
impaired activation in WT microglia and thereby reduced lethality in mice. 
Smaducin-6, which blocks interactions between Peli1 and IRAK1, RIP1, and IKKε,

anti-inflammatory mechanisms. IL-10 is induced at late time-points during acute 
inflammatory conditions triggered by TLR-dependent recognition of infectious 
agents and is involved in setting this balance, operating as a negative 
regulator of the TLR-dependent signaling pathway. We identified 
miR-125a~99b~let-7e as an evolutionary conserved microRNA cluster late-induced 
in human monocytes exposed to the TLR4 agonist LPS as an effect of this 
IL-10-dependent regulatory loop. We demonstrated that microRNAs generated by 
this cluster perform a pervasive regulation of the TLR signaling pathway by 
direct targeting receptors (TLR4, CD14), signaling molecules (IRAK1), and 
effector cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, CCL3, CCL7, CXCL8). Modulation of 
miR-125a~99b~let-7e cluster influenced the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines in response to LPS and the IL-10-mediated tolerance to LPS, thus 
identifying this gene as a previously unrecognized major regulatory element of 
the inflammatory response and endotoxin tolerance.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02037

cognitive impairment by promoting repair of brain damage. However, the 
mechanisms by which this occurs have not been determined. To address this issue, 
we investigated whether an EE enhanced the capability of endogenous bone 
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) to prevent hippocampal 
damage due to diabetes by focusing on miRNA carried in BM-MSC-derived exosomes. 
In diabetic streptozotocin (STZ) rats housed in an EE (STZ/EE), cognitive 
impairment was significantly reduced, and both neuronal and astroglial damage in 
the hippocampus was alleviated compared with STZ rats housed in conventional 
cages (STZ/CC). BM-MSCs isolated from STZ/CC rats had functional and 
morphological abnormalities that were not detected in STZ/EE BM-MSCs. The 
miR-146a levels in exosomes in conditioned medium of cultured BM-MSCs and serum 
from STZ/CC rats were decreased compared with non-diabetic rats, and the level 
was restored in STZ/EE rats. Thus, the data suggest that increased levels of 
miR-146a in sera were derived from endogenous BM-MSCs in STZ/EE rats. To examine 
the possibility that increased miR-146a in serum may exert anti-inflammatory 
effects on astrocytes in diabetic rats, astrocytes transfected with miR-146a 
were stimulated with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) to mimic diabetic 
conditions. The expression of IRAK1, NF-κB, and tumor necrosis factor-α was 
significantly higher in AGE-stimulated astrocytes, and these factors were 
decreased in miR-146a-transfected astrocytes. These results suggested that EEs 
stimulate up-regulation of exosomal miR-146a secretion by endogenous BM-MSCs, 
which exerts anti-inflammatory effects on damaged astrocytes and prevents 
diabetes-induced cognitive impairment.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0204252

and can lead to the continuous production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
perpetuating inflammation, and ultimately resulting in neuronal injury. 
1,2,3,4,6-Penta-O-Galloyl-β-d-Glucose (PGG), which is a naturally occurring 
polyphenolic compound, has exhibited anti-inflammatory effect through the 
inhibition of many cytokines in different experimental models, but its effect on 
activated microglia cells was never described. In the present study, we 
investigated PGG effect in proteins involved in the NFƙB and MAPK signaling 
pathways, which play a central role in inflammation through their ability to 
induce transcription of pro-inflammatory genes.
METHODS: PCR arrays and RT-PCR with individual primers were used to determine 
the effect of PGG on mRNA expression of genes involved in NFƙB and MAPK 
signaling pathways. Western blots were performed to confirm PCR results.
RESULTS: The data obtained showed that PGG modulated the expression of 5 genes 
from the NFƙB (BIRC3, CHUK, IRAK1, NFƙB1, NOD1) and 2 genes from MAPK signaling 
pathway (CDK2 and MYC) when tested in RT-PCR assays. Western blots confirmed the 
PCR results at the protein level, showing that PGG attenuated the expression of 
total and phosphorylated proteins (CDK2, CHUK, IRAK1, and NFƙB1) involved in 
NFƙB and MAPK signaling.

herbs, has been used for treating respiratory inflammatory diseases for >400 
years in the People's Republic of China. However, the mechanisms underlying the 
anti-inflammatory action of dingchuan tang is not fully understood. This study 
aims to investigate the effects of Dingchuan tang essential oil (DCEO) on 
inflammatory mediators and the underlying mechanism of action.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DCEO was extracted by steam distillation. 
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages were used as the cell 
model. Production of nitric oxide (NO) was determined by the Griess test. 
Protein secretion and mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators were measured by the 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. Protein levels were examined by Western 
blot. Nuclear localization of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was detected using 
immunofluorescence analyses.
RESULTS: DCEO significantly reduced LPS-triggered production of NO and 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and decreased protein and mRNA levels of inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). LPS induced 
upregulation of protein and mRNA levels of cytokines (interleukin-1β [IL-1β], 
interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]), and chemokines (monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 5 [CCL-5], and 
macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1α) were suppressed by DCEO treatment. 
Phosphorylation and nuclear protein levels of transcription factors (activator 
protein-1 [AP-1], NF-κB, interferon regulatory factor 3 [IRF3]) were decreased 
by DCEO. Protein levels of phosphorylated IκB-α, IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β), 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), TGF β-activated 
kinase 1 (TAK1), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), and c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) were lowered by DCEO. Moreover, degradation of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and IRAK4 induced by LPS was inhibited by 
DCEO treatment.
CONCLUSION: Suppression of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 
(IRAK)/NF-κB, IRAK/AP-1 and TBK1/IRF3 pathways was associated with the 
inhibitory effects of DCEO on inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 
macrophages. This study provides a pharmacological justification for the use of 
dingchuan tang in managing inflammatory disorders.","DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S160645

with the increased mortality. MicroRNA-146 is one of the most important 
microRNAs identified as a potent negative regulator in innate immune and 
inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We aimed to identify 
the role and potential regulatory mechanism of miR-146a in sepsis-induced 
cardiac dysfunction with the induction of ErbB4 signaling. H9C2 cells were 
treated with LPS to induce sepsis, and miR-146a overexpression significantly 
increased the cell viability, reduced the apoptosis and ROS level, and 
attenuated the release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β. 
Levels of ErbB4, p-NF-κB, NF-κB, TRAF6, IRAK1, caspase 3, Bcl-2, and Bax were 
measured by Western blot. The overexpression of miR-146a significantly increased 
the ErbB4 expression, decreased the expression of TRAF6, IRAK1, caspase 3, and 
the phosphorylation level of NF-κB, and also increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, 
suggesting the inhibition of inflammation and apoptosis. The protective effects 
were all abolished by the use of siErbB4. In conclusion, our results

invasion and hence play an important role in inflammatory and immune responses. 
Rumen-protected methionine (MET) and choline (CHOL) during the peripartal period 
affect the immune response and inflammatory status in dairy cows to different 
extents. We aimed to examine the effect of MET and CHOL supply on expression of 
genes regulating key PMNL functions and associations with whole-blood immune 
challenge. Thirty multiparous Holstein cows from a larger cohort randomly 
assigned from -21 to 30 d relative to parturition to a basal control (CON) diet, 
CON plus MET at a rate of 0.08% of dry matter, or CON plus CHOL at 60 g/d were 
used. Blood was sampled at -10, 7, and 30 d relative to parturition for 
inflammatory biomarker analyses and PMNL isolation. Neutrophil and monocyte 
phagocytosis and oxidative burst in vitro were assessed in whole blood at 1, 7, 
and 28 d. Although neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis did not differ, 
oxidative burst in neutrophils and monocytes was greater in MET-supplemented 
cows relative to CON cows. Compared with CON, PMNL adhesion and 
migration-related genes (ITGAM, ITGB2, ITGA4) were downregulated in response to 
MET and CHOL. Expression of CADM1 and SELL was also lower in MET-supplemented 
cows compared with CON cows but not in CHOL cows. In contrast, compared with CON 
cows, the expression of ICAM1 was lower in CHOL but not MET cows. Similar to 
adhesion and migration-related genes, cows receiving MET- or CHOL-supplemented 
diets had lower expression of inflammation-related genes (IL1β, IL10RA, NFKB1, 
STAT3, TLR2). However, expression of IRAK1 and TLR4 was lower in MET- but not 
CHOL-supplemented cows. Plasma taurine concentration was greater in MET cows 
compared with CHOL and CON cows, suggesting a better redox status in plasma. In 
agreement with plasma taurine, oxidative stress-related genes (CBS, CTH, GPX1, 
GSS, SOD2) in PMNL were lower in response to MET and to CHOL supply. Overall, 
immunometabolic gene expression profile and blood biomarker analyses suggest an 
overall better redox status in PMNL during the transition period in response to 
MET and CHOL supply. These adaptations in PMNL might be beneficial for mounting 
a better bactericidal response upon challenge.","Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

respiratory illnesses are the result of inhalation of desert particulate matter 
(PM) potentially acting in combination with exposure to other pro-inflammatory 
compounds. Why some, but not all, soldiers develop respiratory diseases remains 
unclear. Our goal was to investigate if human airway epithelial cells primed 
with IL-13, a type 2 inflammatory cytokine, demonstrate stronger 
pro-inflammatory responses to Afghanistan desert PM (APM). Primary human brushed 
bronchial epithelial cells from non-deployed, healthy subjects were exposed to 
APM, both with and without IL-13 pretreatment. APM exposure in conjunction with 
IL-13 resulted in significantly increased expression of IL-8, a pro-inflammatory 
cytokine involved in neutrophil recruitment and activation. Furthermore, 
expression of TLR2 mRNA was increased after combined IL-13 and APM exposure. 
siRNA-mediated TLR2 knockdown dampened IL-8 production after exposure to APM 
with IL-13. APM with IL-13 treatment increased IRAK-1 (a downstream signaling 
molecule of TLR2 signaling) activation, while IRAK-1 knockdown effectively 
eliminated the IL-8 response to APM and IL-13. Our data suggest that APM

(TNF-α) stimulated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and exosomes from their culture 
supernatant.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: TNF-α (20 ng/ml) was used to stimulate MSCs, which were 
then regarded as TNF-α cells (TC), while unstimulated cells were the normal 
control cells (NCC). MSCs and their culture supernatant were harvested after 48 
h. Subsequently, exosomes were isolated from culture supernatants with 
ExoQuick-TC and were divided into two groups, TNF-α exosomes (TE) and normal 
control exosomes (NCE). Then, the microRNAs were measured by high-throughput 
sequencing and the results were differentially analyzed. Finally, the 
correlation of the target genes corresponding to differently expressed microRNAs 
was analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis.
RESULTS: High-throughput sequencing showed that the cellular compartment (TC vs. 
NCC) had 280 microRNAs. miR-146a-5p was a uniquely up-regulated microRNA (p < 
0.001) and the most significantly down-regulated microRNA among the 279 
microRNAs included was miR-150-5p (p < 0.001). There were 180 differentially 
expressed microRNAs in the exosome compartment (TE vs. NCE), where miR-146-5p (p 
< 0.001) was one of 176 upregulated microRNAs and miR-203b-5p (p < 0.001) was 
one of 4 downregulated microRNAs. Coincidentally, bioinformatics analysis showed 
that IRAK1 was a critical target gene of miR-146-5p related to the Toll-like 
receptor (TLR) signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with the control group, there were significantly 
differentially expressed microRNAs in both MSCs and exosomes. Interestingly, 
miR-146a-5p was up-regulated in both comparative groups, and its target gene 
IRAK1 plays a crucial part in the TLR signaling pathway. These investigations 
demonstrate a new direction for subsequent inflammation mechanistic studies.","DOI: 10.5114/aoms.2017.70878

(patho-)biology. For instance, they regulate the acute phase response to 
inflammatory signals and are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Much is known 
about the regulation of protein-coding genes by cytokines whereas their effects 
on the miRNome is less well understood. We performed a microarray screen to 
identify microRNAs (miRNAs) in human hepatocytes which are modulated by 
IL-6-type cytokines. Using samples of 2 donors, 27 and 68 miRNAs (out of 1,733) 
were found to be differentially expressed upon stimulation with hyper-IL-6 
(HIL-6) for up to 72 h, with an overlap of 15 commonly regulated miRNAs. qPCR 
validation revealed that miR-146b-5p was also consistently up-regulated in 
hepatocytes derived from 2 other donors. Interestingly, miR-146b-5p (but not 
miR-146a-5p) was induced by IL-6-type cytokines (HIL-6 and OSM) in 
non-transformed liver-derived PH5CH8 and THLE2 cells and in Huh-7 hepatoma 
cells, but not in HepG2 or Hep3B hepatoma cells. We did not find evidence for a 
differential regulation of miR-146b-5p expression by promoter methylation, also 
when analyzing the TCGA data set on liver cancer samples. Inducible 
overexpression of miR-146b-5p in PH5CH8 cells followed by RNA-Seq analysis 
revealed effects on multiple mRNAs, including those encoding IRAK1 and TRAF6 
crucial for Toll-like receptor signaling. Indeed, LPS-mediated signaling was 
attenuated upon overexpression of miR-146b-5p, suggesting a regulatory loop to 
modulate inflammatory signaling in hepatocytes. Further validation experiments 
suggest DNAJC6, MAGEE1, MPHOSPH6, PPP2R1B, SLC10A3, SNRNP27, and TIMM17B to be

spectrum of immune cells. Optimal IL-27 production downstream of TLR3/4 ligand 
stimulation relies on autocrine type I IFN signaling, defining a first and 
second phase in IL-27 production. This work shows that IL-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1) limits TLR3/4- and IFNAR-induced IL-27 production. At the 
mechanistic level, we identified IRAK1 as a novel regulator of STAT1, IRF1, and 
IRF9. We found hyperactivation of STAT1 together with increased nuclear levels 
of IRF1 and IRF9 in IRAK1-deficient murine macrophages compared with control 
cells following stimulation with LPS and poly(I:C). IRAK1-deficient human 
microglial cells showed higher basal levels of STAT1 and STAT2 compared with 
control cells. Blocking the kinase activity of TBK1/IKKε in IRAK1 knockdown 
human microglial cells reduced the high basal levels of STAT1/2, uncovering a 
TBK1/IKKε kinase-dependent mechanism controlling basal levels of STAT1/2. 
Stimulating IRAK1 knockdown human microglial cells with IFN-β led to increased 
IL-27p28 expression compared with control cells. In IRAK1-deficient murine 
macrophages, increased IL-27 levels were detected by ELISA following IFN-β 
stimulation compared with control macrophages together with increased nuclear 
levels of p-STAT1, IRF1, and IRF9. Treatment of wild-type and IRAK1-deficient 
murine macrophages with fludarabine similarly reduced TLR3/4-induced IL-27 
cytokine levels. To our knowledge, this work represents the first report placing 
IRAK1 in the IFNAR pathway and identifies IRAK1 as an important regulator of 
STAT1, controlling IL-27 production downstream of TLR3/4 and IFNAR signaling 
pathways.","Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1701373

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is an incurable lymphoproliferative 
disorder driven by an L265P mutation in the myeloid differentiation primary 
response gene 88 (MYD88), which activates downstream NF-κB signaling through the 
Myddosome. As this pathway depends in part on activity of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs)-1 and -4, we sought to evaluate the 
potential of the IRAK1/4 inhibitor R191 in preclinical models.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patient-derived cell lines and primary samples were used in 
both in vitro and in vivo experiments to model Waldenström's macroglobulinemia 
and its response to IRAK1/4 inhibitors.
RESULTS: R191 induced a dose- and time-dependent reduction in viability of 
BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 Waldenström's cell lines, and suppressed activation of 
IRAK1/4. This was associated with cell-cycle arrest at G0-G1, reduced levels of 
cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, and induction of apoptosis in cell lines and 
primary patient samples. Further downstream, R191 exposure led to reduced 
activation of NF-κB, and of protein kinase B/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin 
signaling, whereas expression of a constitutively active Akt mutant induced R191 
resistance. Gene expression profiling and gene set enrichment analysis revealed 
a signature consistent with inhibition of c-Myc and activation of the 
endoplasmic reticulum stress response. In both subcutaneous and systemic murine 
models of Waldenström's, R191 showed antitumor activity. Finally, the activity 
of R191 was enhanced when it was combined with novel chemotherapeutics such as 
bortezomib, afuresertib, and ibrutinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data support the translation of R191 as an 
approach to target IRAK1/4 to the clinic for patients with Waldenström's 
macroglobulinemia.",©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3265

of innate immune signaling, controlling IL1R and Toll-like receptor 
(TLR)-mediated responses and containing both scaffolding and kinase activities. 
Humans deficient in IRAK4 activity have autosomal recessive primary immune 
deficiency (PID). Here, we characterized the molecular mechanism of dysfunction 
of two IRAK4 PID variants, G298D and the compound variant R12C 
(R12C/R391H/T458I). Using these variants and the kinase-inactive D329A variant 
to delineate the contributions of IRAK4's scaffolding and kinase activities to 
IL1R signaling, we found that the G298D variant is kinase-inactive and expressed 
at extremely low levels, acting functionally as a null mutation. The R12C 
compound variant possessed WT kinase activity, but could not interact with 
myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and IRAK1, causing 
impairment of IL-1-induced signaling and cytokine production. Quantitation of 
IL-1 signaling in IRAK4-deficient cells complemented with either WT or the R12C 
or D329A variant indicated that the loss of MyD88 interaction had a greater 
impact on IL-1-induced signaling and cytokine expression than the loss of IRAK4 
kinase activity. Importantly, kinase-inactive IRAK4 exhibited a greater 
association with MyD88 and a weaker association with IRAK1 in IRAK4-deficient 
cells expressing kinase-inactive IRAK4 and in primary cells treated with a 
selective IRAK4 inhibitor. Loss of IRAK4 kinase activity only partially 
inhibited IL-1-induced cytokine and NF-κB signaling. Therefore, the IRAK4-MyD88 
scaffolding function is essential for IL-1 signaling, but IRAK4 kinase activity 
can control IL-1 signal strength by modulating the association of IRAK4, MyD88, 
and IRAK1.",© 2018 De et al.,"DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.003831

and its anti- and pro-inflammatory effects are reported. However, the mechanisms 
of these pro- and anti-inflammatory effects are not fully defined. Herein, we 
evaluated the dual inflammatory response mechanism of adiponectin in 
macrophages. Short-term globular adiponectin (gAd) treatment induced IκBα 
degradation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 
cells. Polymyxin B pretreatment did not block gAd-induced IκBα degradation, and 
heated gAd was unable to degrade IκBα, suggesting that the effects of gAd were 
not due to endotoxin contamination. gAd activated IKK and Akt, and inhibition of 
either IKK or Akt by dominant-negative IKKβ (DN-IKKβ) or DN-Akt overexpression 
blocked gAd-induced IκBα degradation, suggesting that short-term incubation with 
gAd mediates inflammatory responses by activating the IκB/NF-κB and PI3K/Akt 
pathways. Contrastingly, long-term stimulation with gAd induced, upon subsequent 
stimulation, tolerance to gAd, lipopolysaccharide, and CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide, 
which is associated with gAd-induced downregulation of IL-receptor-associated 
kinase-1 (IRAK-1) due to IRAK-1 transcriptional repression. Conclusively, our 
findings demonstrate that the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to gAd in 
innate immune cells are time-dependent, and mediated by the activation of the

(LPS) presenting microbial invaders but requires exquisite regulation to prevent 
detrimental vascular inflammation. Endothelial cells play active roles in both 
the initiation of inflammation, through the detection of LPS by Toll-like 
Receptor 4 (TLR4), and the resolution of inflammation, through the actions of 
the receptor tyrosine kinase, Tie2. The process by which Tie2 attenuates 
LPS-TLR4 driven inflammation is poorly understood. To investigate the effects of 
Tie2 on TLR4 signalling, Nf-κB activation was monitored in cells expressing Tie2 
mutants harboring tyrosine (Y) to phenylalanine (F) substitutions in the 
cytoplasmic domain. Tie2 attenuated LPS induced Nf-κB activation in a manner 
requiring Tie2 kinase activation, the carboxy-terminal tyrosine residue Y1100 
and downstream Erk1/2 signalling. Tyrosine 1100 was also required for the Tie2 
dependent decrease in expression of the TLR4 signalling proteins, TRAF6 and 
IRAK1 and stabilization of the Nf-κB inhibitor, IκBα. In contrast, upregulation 
of known TLR4 antagonist miRNA-146b-5p required all three tyrosine

they act as sensors of microbial and endogenous danger signals. Upon TLR 
activation, the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domains of TLR dimers 
initiate oligomerization of a multiprotein signaling platform comprising myeloid 
differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and members of the interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family. Formation of this myddosome complex 
initiates signal transduction pathways, leading to the activation of 
transcription factors and the production of inflammatory cytokines. To date, 
little is known about the assembly and disassembly of the myddosome and about 
the mechanisms by which these complexes mediate multiple downstream signaling 
pathways. Here, we isolated myddosome complexes from whole-cell lysates of 
TLR-activated primary mouse macrophages and from IRAK reporter macrophages to 
examine the kinetics of myddosome assembly and disassembly. Using a selective 
inhibitor of IRAK4's kinase activity, we found that whereas TLR cytokine 
responses were ablated, myddosome formation was stabilized in the absence of 
IRAK4's kinase activity. Of note, IRAK4 inhibition had only a minimal effect on 
NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In summary, our 
results indicate that IRAK4 has a critical scaffold function in myddosome 
formation and that its kinase activity is dispensable for myddosome assembly and 
activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways but is essential for MyD88-dependent 
production of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest that the scaffold 
function of IRAK4 may be an attractive target for treating inflammatory and

endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. The 
NADPH oxidase (Nox) family of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating enzymes 
is implicated in these processes, yet little information regarding the role of 
Nox5 is available. Our aim was to investigate the role of Nox5 in promoting 
renal inflammation and identify mechanisms regulating its activity.
RESULTS: Mice with podocyte-specific Nox5 (Nox5pod+) expression demonstrated 
greater glomerular inflammation and increased expression of Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs) and proinflammatory cytokines. In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of 
acute kidney injury, Nox5pod+ and control littermates exhibited increased TLR 
and Nox1 expression. Compared with control littermates, Nox5pod+ animals 
developed greater glomerular inflammation and ROS production. Immortalized human 
podocytes (hPODs) incubated with LPS demonstrated TLR induction, increased Nox5 
expression, and enhanced ROS production. Inhibition of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinases (IRAK)-1 and -4 that lie downstream of TLR inhibited 
LPS-induced ROS production. Interaction between IRAK1 and Nox5 was confirmed by 
coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, LPS treatment of hPODs resulted in 
phosphorylation of threonine residue(s) in Nox5 that was attenuated by an 
IRAK1/4 inhibitor. Innovation and Conclusion: These results are the first to 
demonstrate that Nox5 is a downstream target of the TLR pathway and that 
Nox5-derived ROS may be modulated by IRAK1/4 activity. Nox5-derived ROS in 
podocytes can promote a proinflammatory state in the kidney via induction of 
cytokine expression and upregulation of TLRs leading to a feed-forward loop in 
which TLR activation enhances Nox5-mediated ROS production.","DOI: 10.1089/ars.2017.7402

monocytes and macrophages to respond to repeated stimulation with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which has been suggested to represent a way of 
controlling the intensity and duration of innate immune response. During 
endotoxin tolerance, monocytes undergo functional re-programming primarily by 
epigenetic regulation. Recently, micro-RNA (miR)-146a has been demonstrated to 
be the major player of the negative regulation of the pro-inflammatory response, 
affecting TNF-α production. In this study, we have employed CyP, a 
cyanobacterial LPS antagonist acting on TLR4-MD2 complex, for priming human 
monocytes and evaluating their response to a subsequent challenge with E. coli 
LPS. Results show that CyP is able to induce cross-tolerance to E. coli LPS by 
inhibiting TNF-α production. The mechanism of action is mediated by a specific 
induction of miR-146a and reduction of IRAK1 and TRAF6 expressions in human 
monocytes by CyP priming. Up-regulation of miR-146a by CyP alone, affects 
subsequent cell response in term of TNF-α production even when monocytes are 
incubated with other TLR ligands, as lipoteichoic acid (LTA), thus confirming 
miR-146a as a critical player mediating TNF-α regulation during cross-tolerance

ever-increasing evidence on its capacity of ""desynchronization"" of organismal 
physiology. Photoperiod and circadian cycles are critical parameters to 
influence the biology of reproduction in several animals, including fish. The 
present study is the first proof of the development of an ovarian tumour with 
the effect of light in zebrafish (Danio rerio), an excellent model for 
circadian-related studies. Results of three experimental conditions, continuous 
light for one week, LLW, one month, LLM, and for one year, LLY revealed a clear 
desynchronization of clock associated genes (Clock1a, Bmal1a, Per2, and Cry2a). 
Interestingly, loss of rhythmicity and low concentration of melatonin found in 
these conditions in whole brain, retina, ovary, and serum through ELISA. RNA-Seq 
data of ovarian samples revealed the upregulation of Mid2, Tfg, Irak1, Pim2, 
Tradd, Tmem101, Nfkbib genes and ultimately increase the expression of NF-κB, a 
cellular transformer for tumourigenesis, confirmed by the western blot. The 
appearance of TNFα, inflammatory cytokines and activator of NF-κB also 
increased. Histology approved the formation of thecoma and granulosa cell tumour 
in the one year exposed ovarian sample. The whole transcriptome data analysis 
revealed 1791 significantly upregulated genes in an ovarian tumour. Among these

a commonly used traditional Chinese medicinal herb for treating inflammatory 
diseases. HS has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting 
the MAPKs and NF-κB pathways, the downstream effectors of TLR4 signalling. This 
study aims to further investigate the involvement of TLR4 signalling cascades in 
the effects of an ethanolic extract of HS (HS for short) on inflammatory 
mediators in murine macrophages. HS was extracted using 50% ethanol. 
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages were used as the cell 
model. ELISA was used to detect cytokine/chemokine secretion. Real time-PCR and 
immunoblotting were used to examine mRNA and protein levels, respectively. We 
observed that HS dose-dependently inhibited the secretion of PGE2, MCP-1, MIP-1α 
and RANTES, and down-regulated mRNA levels of iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, 
mPGES-1, MCP-1, MIP-1α and RANTES in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. HS did not 
affect the protein levels of TAK1, TBK1, PI3K, Akt, IKK, c-Jun, c-Fos and IRF3, 
while, dose-dependently decreased levels of their phosphorylated forms. The 
protein levels of IRAK1 and IRAK4 were upregulated, while those of TRAF6 and 
TRAF3 were downregulated by HS. Moreover, the nuclear protein levels of AP-1, 
NF-κB and IRF3 were dose-dependently decreased by HS. These results indicate 
that suppression of the IRAK4/MAPKs/AP-1, IRAK4/MAPKs/NF-κB, IRAK4/PI3K/NF-κB

injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Previous studies found microRNAs 
(miRs) expressed abnormally in the perihematomal tissue and blood of patients 
with ICH and demonstrated that miRs were related to pathophysiological changes 
and prognosis after ICH, and the development of inflammation.
METHODS: We induced a microglial inflammatory response by lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) to construct a microglial inflammatory model. MiR-21/miR-146a 
overexpression adenovirus was used to infect microglia to increase 
miR-21/miR-146a expression. MiR-21, miR-146a, IRAK1, MMP-9, TNF-α, TIMP3 and 
other inflammatory factors were analyzed. Then, miR-21/miR-146a overexpression 
adenovirus was injected into rats with ICH to modulate the expression. 
Inflammation, brain edema, and neurological scores were assessed.
RESULTS: For in vitro and vivo experiments, overexpression of miR-21/miR-146a 
decreased the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IRAK1, MMP-9 and TNF-α, meanwhile 
increased the expression of TIMP3 significantly (P<0.001), compared with the 
negative control group. Additionally, miR-21 and miR-146a reduced brain edema 
and improved the neurological function in ICH rats.
CONCLUSION: Our study proved that miR-21 and miR-146a could negatively regulate 
the inflammatory response of microglia after ICH and provided a new theoretical

mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) is considered an important pathogenic mechanism 
for the establishment of mastitis. Given the interesting link between selenium 
(Se) status and mastitis, our objective was to prove that Se was essential to 
suppress pro-inflammatory mediators, in part, by modulation of Toll-like 
receptor2 (TLR2), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) and mitogen activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway in bMECs.
RESULTS: Results showed that Se (0~ 16 μM) did not affect the growth of bMECs. 
The mRNA expression of TLR2, Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88), 
Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase4 (Irak4), Interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase1 (Irak1) and TNF receptor-associated factor6 (Traf6) 
in TLR2 signal pathway were increased or significantly increased by S. aureus. 
Se played an important role in regulating the genes expression of TLR2, Myd88, 
Traf6 but not in controlling the expression of Irak4 and Irak1. In addition, Se 
exerted strong inhibitory effects on the genes expression of tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by 
S. aureus. To further investigate the possible signaling mechanisms involved in 
the processes, we analyzed the role of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway in 
inflammation response in S. aureus-stimulated bMECs in vitro. Results showed 
that the phosphorylation of inhibitory kappaB alpha (IκBα), p65, p38 and 
extracellular regulated protein kinase (Erk) were significantly increased in S. 
aureus-stimulated bMECs. It indicated that S. aureus activated NF-κB and MAPK 
signaling pathway. We also examined the effects of Se on the phosphorylation of 
IκBα, p65, p38 and Erk in NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway, which have well been 
proved to control the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators during 
inflammation. The findings are exciting, that pretreatment with Se (4, 8 μM) 
significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of IκBα, p65, p38 and Erk.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Se down-regulates inflammatory mediators 
TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 gene expressions via TLR2, NF-κB and MAPK signaling 
pathway in S. aureus-stimulated bMECs, which may be responsible for the 
anti-inflammatory effect of Se.","DOI: 10.1186/s12917-018-1508-y

and inflammation. We have previously established that oral epithelial cells 
upregulate IL-36γ expression in response to the bacterial pathogen Porphyromonas

expression of mechanistically distinct antimicrobial proteins, including the 
peptidoglycan amidase PGLYRP2, in oral epithelial cells (e.g., TIGK cells). 
PGLYRP2 gene expression was not stimulated by either IL-17 or IL-22, thus 
demonstrating selectivity in the regulation of PGLYRP2 by IL-36γ. The 
IL-36γ-inducible expression of PGLYRP2 was shown to be mediated by IRAK1- and 
p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent signaling. Furthermore, our 
finding that IL-36γ-inducible PGLYRP2 expression was reduced in proliferating 
TIGK cells but increased in terminally differentiating cells suggests that 
control of PGLYRP2 expression is associated with the maturation of the oral 
epithelium. PGLYRP2 expression in TIGK cells can also be directly stimulated by 
oral bacteria. However, the extracellular gingipain proteases (Kgp and RgpA/B) 
produced by P. gingivalis, which are critical virulence factors, can antagonize 
PGLYRP2 expression. Thus, the expression of IL-36γ by oral epithelial cells in 
response to P. gingivalis might enable the subsequent autocrine stimulation of 
PGLYRP2 expression. In summary, our data identify how IL-36γ may promote oral

pathogens and mounting effective innate and adaptive immune responses. However, 
the precise mechanism by which Leishmania donovani, an obligate intramacrophagic 
pathogen, breaches IL-1R/TLR signaling and host-protective immunity remains 
obscure. In this study, we report the novel biphasic role of Toll-interacting 
protein (Tollip), a negative regulator of the IL-1R/TLR pathway, in the disease 
progression of experimental visceral leishmaniasis. We observed that during 
early hours of infection, L. donovani induced phosphorylation of IRAK-1, 
resulting in the release of Tollip from the IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 
complex in J774 macrophages, which then acted as an endocytic adaptor on cell 
surface IL-1R1 and promoted its lysosomal degradation. In the later stage, 
Tollip shuttled back to IRAK-1, thereby inhibiting IRAK-1 phosphorylation in 
association with IRAK-M to neutralize downstream TLR signaling in infected 
macrophages. Moreover, during late infection, L. donovani enhanced nuclear 
translocation and recruitment of transcription factors early growth response 
protein 2, NF erythroid 2-related factor 2, and Ahr on Tollip promoter for its 
induction. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Tollip in infected 
macrophages significantly enhanced NF-κB activation and induced host-defensive 
IL-12 and TNF-α synthesis, thereby reducing amastigote multiplication. Likewise, 
abrogation of Tollip in L. donovani-infected BALB/c mice resulted in STAT-1-, 
IRF-1-, and NF-κB-mediated upregulation of host-protective cytokines and reduced 
organ parasite burden, thereby implicating its role in disease aggravation. 
Taken together, we conclude that L. donovani exploited the multitasking function 
of Tollip for its own establishment through downregulating IL-1R1/TLR signaling 
in macrophages.","Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800062

inflammatory cascade, which is negatively regulated by miR146a. Previous studies 
showed that the TT genotype of rs2431697, located near the miR-146a gene, drives 
lower miR-146a transcription and predicts adverse cardiovascular events in 
anticoagulated atrial fibrillation patients. Moreover, systemic miR-146a 
administration protects mice from atherosclerosis. Here we evaluated the ability 
of miR-146a expression in the hematopoietic component to regulate 
atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein receptor-null mice (Ldlr-/-).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Lethally-irradiated Ldlr-/- mice transplanted with bone 
marrow from wild-type or miR-146a-null mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 8 
and 20 weeks. Irak1, Traf6 and MIR146A expression were quantified in thoracic 
aorta by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Aortic plaque size and composition were 
characterized by Oil-Red staining and immunohistochemistry and leukocyte 
recruitment by intravital microscopy. Blood cell counts were similar in fat-fed 
Ldlr-/-mice with or without hematopoietic miR-146a expression. However, plasma 
cholesterol decreased in fat-fed Ldlr-/-mice transplanted with bone marrow 
deficient for miR-146a. Finally, aortic atherosclerosis burden and recruitment 
of leukocytes into the vessel wall were undistinguishable between the two 
groups, despite higher levels of Irak1 and Traf6 mRNA and protein in the aorta 
of fat-fed mice lacking hematopoietic miR-146a expression.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-146a deficiency exclusively in hematopoietic cells modulates 
cholesterol levels in plasma and the expression of its targets in the artery 
wall of fat-fed Ldlr-/- mice, but does not accelerate atherosclerosis. 
Atheroprotection upon systemic miR-146a administration may therefore be caused

administration. Mechanical stimuli and radiant heat were used to evaluate 
mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia.
RESULTS: We found that the level of miRNA-146a-5p significantly increased in 
L4-L6 DRGs and SDH after CCI surgery; meanwhile, the protein level of IRAK1 and 
TRAF6 in DRGs was significantly increased after CCI. Intrathecal injection of 
miR146a-5p agomir or miRNA-146a-5p antagomir regulates miRNA-146a-5p level of 
L4-L6 DRGs and SDH. We found that intrathecal injection of miR146a-5p agomir can 
alleviate mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in CCI rats and reverse the 
upregulation of IRAK1 and TRAF6 of L4-L6 DRGs and SDH induced by CCI. We 
furthermore found that intrathecal injection of miRNA-146a-5p antagomir can 
exacerbate the mechanical and thermal pain-related behavior of CCI rats and 
meanwhile increase IRAK1 and TRAF6 of L4-L6 DRGs and SDH expression even 
further.
CONCLUSIONS: miRNA-146a-5p of DRG and SDH can modulate the development of 
CCI-induced neuropathic pain through inhibition of IRAK1 and TRAF6 in the TIR 
signaling pathway. Hence, miRNA-146a-5p may serve as a potential therapeutic 
target for neuropathic pain.","DOI: 10.1186/s12974-018-1215-4

hyperglycemia were closely associated with alteration of miR-146a. Here, we 
investigated the role of miR-146a in mediating inflammation and oxidative stress 
in the brain of chronic T2DM rats. Methods: The chronic T2DM (cT2DM) models were 
induced by intraperitoneal administration of STZ (35 mg/kg) after being fed a 
high-fat, high-sugar diet for 6 weeks. H&E staining was conducted to observe the 
morphological impairment of the rat hippocampus. The expressions of inflammatory 
mediators (COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β) and antioxidant proteins (Nrf2, HO-1) were 
measured by western blot. The levels of MDA and SOD were detected by the 
respective activity assay kit. The levels of p22phox and miR-146a were examined 
by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expressions of IRAK1, TRAF6 and 
NF-κB p65 were measured by western blot and qRT-PCR. Pearson correlation 
analysis was performed to investigate the correlations between miR-146a and 
inflammatory mediators as well as oxidative stress indicators. Results: The 
expression of miR-146a was negatively correlated with inflammation and oxidative 
stress status. In the brain tissues of cT2DM rats, it was observed that the 
expressions of inflammatory mediators (COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β) and oxidative stress 
indicators including MDA and p22phox were elevated, which were negatively 
correlated with the expression of miR-146a. While, the antioxidant proteins 
(Nrf2, HO-1, SOD) levels decreased in the brain of cT2DM rats, which were 
positively correlated with the miR-146a level. The expressions of NF-κB p65 and 
its specific modulators (IRAK1&TRAF6) were elevated in the brain of cT2DM rats, 
which might be inhibited by miR-146a. Conclusion: Our results implied that 
increased inflammation and oxidative stress status were associated with brain 
impairment in cT2DM rats, which were negatively correlated with miR-146a 
expression. Thus, miR-146a may serve as a negative comprehensive indicator of 
inflammation and oxidative stress status in the brain of chronic T2DM rats.","DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00478

having a broad impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Still, limited 
information exists regarding their ""modus operandi"", as it critically depends on 
exosomal cargo, environmental context and target cells. Therefore, a more 
thorough understanding of the role of exosomes from different cell types as 
mediators of neuroinflammation in AD context is a decisive step to open avenues 
for innovative and efficient therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that 
SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the Swedish mutant of APP695 (SHSwe) remarkably 
express increased inflammatory markers, combined with higher APP and Aβ1-40 
production, when compared to naïve SH-SY5Y (SH) cells. Although exerting an 
early clearance effect on extracellular APP and Aβ accumulation when in 
co-culture with SHSwe cells, human CHME3 microglia gradually lose such property, 
and express both pro-inflammatory (iNOS, IL-1β, TNF-α, MHC class II, IL-6) and 
pro-resolving genes (IL-10 and Arginase 1), while also evidence increased 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Interestingly, upregulation of 
inflammatory-associated miRNA (miR)-155, miR-146a and miR-124 by SHSwe secretome 
shows to be time-dependent and to inversely correlate with their respective 
targets (SOCS-1, IRAK1 and C/EBP-α). We report that microglia also internalize 
exosomes released from SHSwe cells, which are enriched in miR-155, miR-146a, 
miR-124, miR-21 and miR-125b and recapitulate the cells of origin. Furthermore, 
we show that SHSwe-derived exosomes are capable of inducing acute and delayed 
microglial upregulation of TNF-α, HMGB1 and S100B pro-inflammatory markers, from 
which only S100B is found on their derived exosomes. Most importantly, our data 
reveal that miR-21 is a consistent biomarker that is found not only in SHSwe 
cells and in their released exosomes, but also in the recipient CHME3 microglia 
and derived exosomes. This work contributes to the increased understanding of 
neuron-microglia communication and exosome-mediated neuroinflammation in AD, 
while highlights miR-21 as a promising biomarker/target for therapeutic 
intervention.",Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.biochi.2018.05.015

inflammation. Myelofibrosis is the end result of inflammation in bone, caused by 
an inflammatory process triggered by production of abnormal myeloid cells driven 
by mutations affecting the JAK-STAT pathway. Inflammatory cytokine 
overproduction leads to increased mesenchymal cell proliferation, culminating in 
fibrosis. Although JAK2 inhibitors, such as the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and 
the JAK2/FLT3/CSF1R/IRAK1 inhibitor pacritinib suppress abnormal clone expansion 
in myelofibrosis, ruxolitinib does not appear to prevent or reverse bone-marrow 
fibrosis in most patients. In two Phase III clinical trials, pacritinib, 
however, demonstrated improvements in platelet counts and hemoglobin and 
reductions in transfusion burden in some patients with baseline cytopenias, 
suggesting it may improve bone-marrow function. Unlike ruxolitinib, pacritinib 
suppresses signaling through IRAK1, a key control point for inflammatory and 
fibrotic signaling.
PURPOSE: To investigate potential antifibrotic effects of pacritinib in an 
animal model of liver fibrosis relevant to the observed course of human disease.
METHODS: Pacritinib, negative control (vehicle), and positive control (the 
angiotensin 2-receptor antagonist and PPARγ partial agonist telmisartan) were 
assessed in the murine Stelic animal model, which mimics the clinically observed 
progression from hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, liver 
fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathological analysis used 
hematoxylin and eosin staining. Body and liver weight changes, nonalcoholic 
fatty-liver disease activity scores, and plasma cytokeratin 18 fragment levels 
(a biomarker of hepatic necrosis) were measured.
RESULTS: Pacritinib-treated mice had significantly (P<0.01) reduced fibrotic 
areas in liver compared to vehicle control and significantly (P<0.05) lower 
levels of CK18. The antifibrotic effect of pacritinib was comparable to that of 
telmisartan, but without significant effects on fat accumulation.
CONCLUSION: These results, the first to demonstrate hepatic antifibrotic effects 
for pacritinib in an animal model of liver disease, provide preliminary support 
for potential clinical applications of pacritinib in fibrotic diseases other 
than myelofibrosis.","DOI: 10.2147/JEP.S150729

METHODS The neonatal rat models of NEC were established though hypoxia-cold 
stimulation. All rats were divided into 3 groups: an NEC model group (NEC 
group), an IRAK inhibitor group (IRAKI group), and a normal control group (NC 
group). At 72 h after the models were established, intestinal tissues were 
collected for histopathological examination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS After IRAK 
inhibitor intervention, the symptoms of NEC in neonatal rats were alleviated, 
and the degree of weight loss was reduced. In the IRAK group, the intestinal 
pathology of neonatal rats was improved, pathological score was decreased, and 
the incidence rate of NEC was significantly reduced. The levels of tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-6 in the IRAK group were 
significantly decreased compared with those in the NEC group. There were no 
significant differences in IRAK1 and IRAK4 protein expression levels between the 
IRAK group and the NEC group. The phosphorylated IRAK1 and IRAK4 in the IRAK 
group were significantly decreased. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) level of 
intestinal tissues in the IRAK group was reduced compared with that in the NEC 
group. CONCLUSIONS IRAK inhibitors can inhibit the inflammatory response of the

cancers. We evaluated the role of IRAK1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
assessed the inhibitory activity of multikinase inhibitor pacritinib on IRAK1 in 
AML. We demonstrated that IRAK1 is overexpressed in AML and provides a survival 
signal to AML cells. Genetic knockdown of IRAK1 in primary AML samples and 
xenograft model showed a significant reduction in leukemia burden. Kinase 
profiling indicated pacritinib has potent inhibitory activity against IRAK1. 
Computational modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated 
high-affinity binding of pacritinib to the IRAK1 kinase domain. Pacritinib 
exposure reduced IRAK1 phosphorylation in AML cells. A higher percentage of

Pacritinib inhibited the growth of AML cells harboring a variety of genetic 
abnormalities not limited to FLT3 and JAK2. Pacritinib treatment reduced AML

affecting up to 1% of the population worldwide. The aim of the present study was 
to investigate whether miRNA-146a rs2910164, miRNA-499 rs3746444, IRAK1 
rs3027898 and PADI4 rs1748033 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility 
to RA in Egyptians and whether they influence disease severity and activity.
METHODS: The study was performed on 104 unrelated RA patients and 112 healthy 
subjects. RA patients were further subdivided into active and inactive RA 
groups. Polymorphisms were genotyped by using real-time polymerase chain 
reaction with TaqMan allelic discrimination assay.
RESULTS: Significant differences in the frequency of miRNA-146a rs2910164, 
miRNA-499 rs3746444, IRAK1 rs3027898 and PADI4 rs1748033 alleles and genotypes

IRAK1 rs3027898 shows a significant difference between active and inactive 
subgroups. MiRNA-146a rs2910164 and IRAK1 rs3027898 polymorphisms were a risk 
factor for predisposition to RA in codominant and dominant tested inheritance

risk factor in codominant and recessive one. CG and GG genotypes of miRNA-146a 
rs2910164 were associated with positive erosions. CA genotype of IRAK1 rs3027898 
was associated with low disease activity and negative erosions, while, the AA 
genotype was associated with high disease activity. CC genotype of PADI4

with female predominance, particularly affecting those of childbearing age. We 
performed analysis of three genome-wide genotyping datasets of populations of 
both Chinese and European origin.
METHODS: This study involved 5695 cases and 10,357 controls in the discovery 
stage. The lead signal on chromosome X was followed by replication in three 
additional Asian cohorts, with 2300 cases and 4244 controls in total. 
Conditional analysis of the known associated loci on chromosome X was also 
performed to further explore independent signals.
RESULTS: Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs13440883 in GPR173 was found to be 
significantly associated with SLE (Pmeta = 7.53 × 10- 9, ORmeta= 1.16), whereas 
conditional analysis provided evidence of a potential independent signal in the 
L1CAM-IRAK1-MECP2 region in Asian populations (rs5987175 [LCA10]).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel SLE susceptibility locus on the X chromosome. 
This finding emphasizes the importance of the X chromosome in disease 
pathogenesis and highlights the role of sex chromosomes in the female bias of 
SLE.","DOI: 10.1186/s13075-018-1590-3

performed to compare the levels of miR-146a-5p, IFN-γ, IRAK1, and TRAF6 in the 
deciduae of URSA (n=29) and healthy women (n=35) after an elective abortion.
RESULTS: The levels of miR-146a-5p were lower in the deciduae of patients with 
URSA compared with control subjects (P=0.027). The mRNA and protein expressions

such as asthma, COPD, arrhythmias, lung cancer, etc., which are related to 
PM-induced inflammation. We have found that PM2.5 (aerodynamics diameter <2.5 
µm) exposure induces inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. Since the 
toxicity of PM is tightly associated with its size and components, PM1 
(aerodynamics diameter <1.0 µm) is supposed to be more toxic than PM2.5 . 
However, the mechanism of PM1 -induced inflammation is not clear. Recently, 
emerging evidences prove that microRNAs play a vital role in regulating 
inflammation. Therefore, we studied the regulation of miR-146a in PM1 -induced 
inflammation in human lung bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. The results show 
that PM1 induces the increase of IL-6 and IL-8 in BEAS-2B cells and up-regulates 
the miR-146a expression by activating NF-κB signaling pathway. Overexpressed 
miR-146a prevents the nuclear translocation of p65 through inhibiting the 
IRAK1/TRAF6 expression, and downregulates the expression of IL-6 and IL-8. Taken 
together, these results demonstrate that miR-146a can negatively feedback

dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice based on systems 
pharmacology approach.
METHODS: Systems pharmacology approach was used to predict the active 
ingredients, candidate targets and the efficacy of AMP on ulcerative colitis 
(UC) using a holistic process of active compound screening, target fishing, 
network construction and analysis. A DSS-induced colitis model in C57BL/6 mice 
(n = 10/group) was constructed and treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid (100 
mg/kg/d) and AMP (400 mg/kg/d) to confirm the underlying mechanisms and effects 
of AMP on UC with western blot analyses, polymerase chain reaction, histological 
staining and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The therapeutic effects of AMP against DSS-induced colitis were 
determined in the beginning, and the results showed that AMP significantly 
improved the disease in general observations and histopathology analysis. 
Subsequent systems pharmacology predicted 89 corresponding targets for the four 
candidate compounds of AMP, as well as 123 candidate targets of UC, and 
protein-protein interaction networks were constructed for the interaction of 
putative targets of AMP against UC. Enrichment analyses on TNF-α and RANKL/RANK, 
a receptor activator of NF-κB signaling pathways, were then carried out. 
Experimental validation revealed that inflammation-related signaling pathways 
were activated in the DSS group, and AMP significantly suppressed DSS-induced 
high expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, IκB and NF-κB, and inhibited the elevated 
expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8.
CONCLUSION: AMP could exert protective effects on UC via suppressing the 
IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways.","DOI: 10.3748/wjg.v24.i13.1398

polysaccharide occurring in the cell walls of brown algae, provides beneficial 
effects for intestinal health. However, the underlying mechanisms by which AOS 
supplementation maintains the intestinal integrity of weaned pigs remain 
obscure. Here, we aimed to determine how AOS modulates the intestinal integrity 
of weaned pigs. Twenty-four weaned pigs were assigned to two treatments: a 
control group (basal diet) and an AOS group (the basal diet supplemented with 
100 mg kg-1 AOS). On day 15, eight pigs per treatment were randomly selected and 
sacrificed for serum and intestinal samples. We observed that AOS 
supplementation enhanced the intestinal integrity, as evidenced by the increased 
(P < 0.05) intestinal occludin protein abundance. Compared to the control group, 
AOS ingestion both elevated (P < 0.05) the jejunal and ileal catalase activity 
and decreased (P < 0.05) the duodenal and jejunal tumour necrosis factor-α 
concentration and mast cell tryptase expression. Furthermore, AOS down-regulated 
(P < 0.05) the duodenal toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its down-stream signals,

transplantation. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, is the lone therapy approved 
for MF, offering a clear symptom and spleen benefit at the expense of 
treatment-related cytopenias. Pacritinib (PAC), a multi-kinase inhibitor with 
specificity for JAK2, FLT3, and IRAK1 but sparing JAK1, has demonstrated 
clinical activity in MF with minimal myelosuppression. Due to an FDA-mandated 
full clinical hold, the randomized phase 3 PERSIST trials were abruptly stopped 
and PAC was immediately discontinued for all patients. Thirty-three patients 
benefitting from PAC on clinical trial prior to the hold were allowed to resume 
therapy on an individual, compassionate-use basis. This study reports the 
detailed outcomes of 19 of these PAC retreatment patients with a median 
follow-up of 8 months. Despite a median platelet count of 49 × 109/L at restart 
of PAC, no significant change in hematologic profile was observed. Grade 3/4 
adverse events of epistaxis (n = 1), asymptomatic QT prolongation (n = 1), and 
bradycardia (n = 1) occurred in three patients within the first 3 months of 
retreatment. One death due to catheter-associated sepsis occurred. The median 
time to discontinuation of PAC therapy on compassionate use for all 33 patients 
was 12.2 (95% CI 8.3-NR) months. PAC retreatment was associated with modest 
improvement in splenomegaly without progressive myelosuppression and supports 
the continued development of this agent for the treatment of MF second line to 
ruxolitinib or in the setting of treatment-limiting thrombocytopenia.","DOI: 10.1007/s00277-018-3309-6

analyses have revealed that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) 
is associated with susceptibility to SLE. Our previous study investigated the 
role of IRAK1 in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-related pathways in a mouse model of 
lupus. In this study, we aimed to further explore the etiological role of IRAK1. 
The gene expression and phosphorylation of IRAK1 in CD4+ T cells from lupus 
patients and healthy controls were examined by quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The 
percentage of circulating Th17 cells and plasma IL-17A levels were evaluated by 
flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The 
influence of IRAK1 suppression on Th17 development was assessed using an IRAK1 
inhibitor and small interfering RNA. We found that IRAK1 transcript levels in 
CD4+ T cells were significantly upregulated in SLE patients in comparison to 
controls and were positively correlated with disease activity. In vitro 
experiments showed that lupus CD4+ T cells had more pronounced IRAK1 
phosphorylation at threonine-209 upon IL-1β stimulation than did control cells. 
Moreover, IRAK1 expression was positively associated with Th17/IL-17A in 
patients. When naïve CD4+ T cells were polarized toward the Th17 subset, IRAK1 
inhibition significantly repressed IL-17A production and the gene expression of 
Th17 markers, namely, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor c, IL-23 
receptor and IL-17A. In summary, IRAK1 is overexpressed and hyperactivated in 
CD4+ T cells from SLE patients. IRAK1 inhibition attenuates Th17 differentiation 
in the context of human SLE, suggesting a therapeutic opportunity.","DOI: 10.1080/08820139.2018.1458105

for host defense against malignancy and viruses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a 
critical role in regulating responses of immune cells including NK cells. 
Accumulating evidence suggests that miR-146a is involved in the regulation of 
immune responses. However, the mechanism by which miR-146a regulates NK cell 
function is largely unknown. In the current study, we found that miR-146a 
intrinsically regulated NK cell function. Forced overexpression of miR-146a 
decreased IFN-γ production, whereas downregulation of miR-146a by anti-miR-146a 
significantly enhanced IFN-γ production in the human NK-92 cell line and primary 
human NK cells upon stimulation with IL-12 or co-stimulation with IL-12 and 
IL-18. Mechanistically, miR-146a regulated IFN-γ production via NF-κB, as 
evidenced in NK-92 cells, by downregulation of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation when 
miR-146a was overexpressed but upregulation of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation when 
anti-miR-146a was overexpressed. miR-146a directly targeted IRAK1 and TRAF6, the 
upstream signaling components of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This direct 
targeting mechanism confirmed the above gain- and loss-of-function approaches. 
However, the potent IFN-γ-producing subset, CD56bright NK cells, expressed 
higher levels of miR-146a than the lesser IFN-γ-producing subset, CD56dim NK 
cells. We also observed that co-stimulation of IL-12 and IL-18 significantly 
increased miR-146a expression in bulk NK cells and in the CD56bright subset in a 
time-dependent manner, correlating with augmented IFN-γ production. These data 
suggest that miR-146a plays a negative role in IFN-γ production by human NK 
cells and this miRNA may be critical in preventing NK cells from being super 
activated and overproducing IFN-γ.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00293

propagate to nearby immune effectors. It is well-known that Toll signal pathway 
induces antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression. Eicosanoids play crucial 
roles in mediating the recognition signal to immune effectors by enhancing 
humoral immune response through activation of AMP synthesis as well as cellular 
immune responses, suggesting a functional cross-talk between Toll and eicosanoid 
signals. This study tested a cross-talk between these two signals. Two signal 
transducing factors (MyD88 and Pelle) of Toll immune pathway were identified in 
Spodoptera exigua. RNA interference (RNAi) of either SeMyD88 or SePelle 
expression interfered with the expression of AMP genes under Toll signal 
pathway. Bacterial challenge induced PLA2 enzyme activity. However, RNAi of 
these two immune factors significantly suppressed the induction of PLA2 enzyme 
activity. Furthermore, RNAi treatment prevented gene expression of cellular 
PLA2. Inhibition of PLA2 activity reduced phenoloxidase activity and subsequent 
suppression in cellular immune response measured by hemocyte nodule formation. 
However, immunosuppression induced by RNAi of Toll signal molecules was 
significantly reversed by addition of arachidonic acid (AA), a catalytic product 
of PLA2. The addition also significantly reduced the enhanced fungal 
susceptibility of S. exigua treated by RNAi against two Toll signal molecules.

immune responses and are implicated in several immune disorders including gouty 
arthritis. The expression of miR-146a is upregulated in the peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells of patients with inter-critical gout when compared to 
normouricemic and hyperuricemic controls and those patients with acute gout 
flares. However, the role of miR-146a in the development of gout remains 
unknown. Here, we used miR-146a knockout (KO) mice to test miR-146a function in 
a monosodium urate (MSU)-induced gouty arthritis model.
METHODS: The footpad or ankle joint of miR-146a KO and wild-type (WT) mice were 
injected with an MSU suspension to induce acute gouty arthritis. Bone 
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with MSU and the gene 
expression of miR-146a; interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β); tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α); and the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NALP3) 
inflammasome was evaluated. TNF-α and IL-1β protein levels in BMDMs were 
assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and western blot analyses. Gene 
and protein levels of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1), the targets of miR-146a, were also measured.
RESULTS: Significantly increased paw swelling and index and ankle joint swelling 
were observed in miR-146a KO mice compared to WT controls after MSU treatment. 
MiR-146a expression in BMDMs from WT mice was dramatically upregulated at 4 h 
following MSU stimulation. Additionally, the expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, and 
NALP3 was higher in BMDMs from miR-146a KO mice after exposure to MSU crystals 
compared to those from WT mice. Consistent with the observed gene expression, 
the IL-1β and TNF-α proteins were upregulated in miR-146a KO mice. Additionally 
quantitative RT-PCR and western blot demonstrated that TRAF6 and IRAK1 were 
dramatically upregulated in BMDMs from miR-146 KO mice compared to those from WT 
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these observations suggest that miR-146a provides 
negative feedback regulation of gouty arthritis development and lack of miR-146a 
enhances gouty arthritis via upregulation of TRAK6, IRAK-1, and the NALP3 
inflammasome function.","DOI: 10.1186/s13075-018-1546-7

ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury; however, its role in cerebral I/R injury is 
unclear and requires further investigation. In this study, cerebral I/R injury 
was established in mice via middle cerebral artery occlusion, and the expression 
of miR-146a was detected in the brain tissue via quantitative real-time PCR. We 
found that the expression of miR-146a was upregulated. Furthermore, the 
endogenous miR-146a was antagonized by its specific inhibitor. The results 
indicated that the inhibition of miR-146a deteriorated I/R-induced 
neurobehavioral impairment, exaggerated the infarct size, and exacerbated 
blood-brain barrier leakage. Cerebral I/R injury-induced generation of 
inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and 
IL-6, was further promoted by miR-146a inhibitor. The expression of 
interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), a target of miR-146a, was 
upregulated upon miR-146a inhibition. In addition, the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) 
signaling pathway was over-activated when miR-146a was antagonized as manifested 
by the increased levels of phospho-NF-κB inhibitor α and nuclear p65. In 
summary, our findings demonstrate that the elevation of miR-146a may be one of 
the compensatory responses after the cerebral I/R injury and suggest miR-146a as 
a potential therapeutic target for cerebral I/R injury.","DOI: 10.1139/cjpp-2017-0586

(#)Contributed equally","Frequent relapse and drug resistance in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) can be attributed to the existence of tumor-initiating cells (TIC) within 
the tumor bulk. Therefore, targeting liver TICs may improve the prognosis of 
these patients. From transcriptome sequencing of 16 pairs of clinical HCC 
samples, we report that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) in 
the TLR/IRAK pathway is significantly upregulated in HCC. IRAK1 overexpression 
in HCC was further confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels and correlated with 
advanced tumor stages and poor patient survival. Interestingly, IRAK4, an 
upstream regulator of IRAK1, was also consistently upregulated. IRAK1 regulated 
liver TIC properties, including self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and liver TIC 
marker expression. IRAK1 inhibition sensitized HCC cells to doxorubicin and 
sorafenib treatment in vitro via suppression of the apoptotic cascade. 
Pharmacological inhibition of IRAK1 with a specific IRAK1/4 kinase inhibitor 
consistently suppressed liver TIC populations. We identified aldo-keto reductase 
family 1 member 10 (AKR1B10) as a novel downstream target of IRAK1, which was 
found to be overexpressed in HCC and significantly correlated with IRAK1 
expression. Knockdown of AKR1B10 negated IRAK1-induced TIC functions via 
modulation of the AP-1 complex. Inhibition of IRAK1/4 inhibitor in combination 
with sorafenib synergistically suppressed tumor growth in an HCC xenograft 
model. In conclusion, targeting the IRAK4/IRAK1/AP-1/AKR1B10 signaling pathway 
may be a potential therapeutic strategy against HCC.Significance:

(TLR) pathway signaling molecules (myd88, irak-1, irf5, and irf7) in the Chinese 
rare minnow were cloned and exhibited a high amino-acid sequence identity 
compared to other cyprinid fish orthologs. The mRNA expressions of these genes 
in the different tissues (liver, brain, spleen, kidney, and skin) were observed. 
The highest expression levels of myd88, irak-1, and irf5 were detected in the 
spleen, whereas il-8 and irf7 were detected in the kidney and liver 
respectively. The mRNA expression of irak-1, irf5, and irf7 in the liver from 
0.1 μg/L and 0.5 μg/L CPF treatments were significantly increased on day 7 (p < 
0.05), whereas the levels of only irak-1 and irf7 were markedly increased on day 
28 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the mRNA expression of il-8 in the spleen following 
0.5 μg/L CPF treatments was significantly decreased on day 7 (p < 0.05), whereas 
significantly decrease were observed in the levels of irf7 in the spleen at 
2.5 μg/L CPF on days 7 and 28 (p < 0.05). The 0.1 μg/L and 0.5 μg/L of CPF 
significantly induced the levels of irak-1 and myd88 in the spleen after 28 d 
exposure (p < 0.05). Therefore, the high induction of cytokines and TLR pathway 
signaling molecules demonstrated that Chinese rare minnow was immune-compromised 
exposed to CPF. Moreover, our finding indicated that these immune-related genes

one of the major pathogenic factors of chronic periodontitis (CP). Few reports 
on the correlation between P. gingivalis-LPS and cognitive function exist. Thus, 
the present study aimed to investigate the effects of P. gingivalis-LPS on 
cognitive function and the associated underlying mechanism in C57BL/6 mice.
METHODS: The C57BL/6 mice were injected with P. gingivalis-LPS (5 mg kg-1) 
either with or without Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor (TAK-242, 
5 mg kg-1). After 7 days, behavioral alterations were assessed with the open 
field test (OFT), Morris water maze (MWM) test, and passive avoidance test 
(PAT). The activation of astrocytes and microglia in the cerebral cortex and 
hippocampus of mice was observed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of 
inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8), TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, and 
TLR4), and CD14 and the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (IRAK1, p65, 
and p-p65) in the cerebral cortex of the mice were evaluated by RT-PCR, ELISA, 
and western blot.
RESULTS: The OFT showed that P. gingivalis-LPS did not affect the initiative and 
activity of mice. Administration of P. gingivalis-LPS significantly impaired 
spatial learning and memory during the MWM test and attenuated the ability of 
passive avoidance learning during the PAT. Both astrocytes and microglia were 
activated in the cortex and hippocampus. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein 
expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) was 
upregulated by P. gingivalis-LPS in the cortex. In addition, the TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling pathway was activated (TLR4, CD14, IRAK1, and p-p65). These effects 
were effectively alleviated by TAK-242.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of P. gingivalis-LPS can lead to learning and memory 
impairment in C57BL/6 mice. This impairment is mediated by activation of the 
TLR4 signaling pathway. Our study suggests that P. gingivalis-LPS-induced 
neuroinflammation plays an important role in cognitive impairment. It also 
reveals that endotoxins of periodontal pathogens could represent a risk factor 
for cognitive disorders.","DOI: 10.1186/s12974-017-1052-x

by preventing excessive proinflammatory responses. Tollip genetic variation has 
been associated with airflow limitation in asthma subjects and Tollip 
expression. Whether Tollip regulates lung inflammation in a type 2 cytokine 
milieu (e.g., IL-13) is unclear. Our goal was to determine the in vivo role of 
Tollip in IL-13-mediated lung eosinophilic inflammation and the underlying 
mechanisms. Tollip-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were inoculated 
intranasally with recombinant mouse IL-13 protein to examine lung inflammation. 
To determine how Tollip regulates inflammation, alveolar macrophages and bone 
marrow-derived macrophages from Tollip KO and WT mice were cultured with or 
without IL-13 and/or IL-33. IL-13-treated Tollip KO mice significantly increased 
lung eosinophilic inflammation and eotaxin-2 (CCL24) levels compared with the WT 
mice. IL-13- treated Tollip KO (vs. WT) macrophages, in the absence and 
particularly in the presence of IL-33, increased expression of the IL-33 
receptor ST2L and CCL24, which was in part dependent on enhanced activation of 
interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and signal transducer

downregulates IL-13-mediated pulmonary eosinophilia in part through inhibiting

developmental and metabolic diseases due to their impaired growth and 
development in the mammalian embryo/fetus during pregnancy. In the present 
study, we hypothesized that IUGR may lead to abnormally regulated DNA 
methylation in the intestine, causing intestinal dysfunctions. We applied 
reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) technology to study the 
jejunum tissues from four newborn IUGR piglets and their normal body weight 
(NBW) littermates. The results revealed extensively regional DNA methylation 
changes between IUGR/NBW pairs from different gilts, affecting dozens of genes. 
Hiseq-based bisulfite sequencing PCR (Hiseq-BSP) was used for validations of 19 
genes with epigenetic abnormality, confirming three genes (AIFM1, MTMR1, and 
TWIST2) in extra samples. Furthermore, integrated analysis of these 19 genes 
with proteome data indicated that there were three main genes (BCAP31, IRAK1, 
and AIFM1) interacting with important immunity- or metabolism-related proteins, 
which could explain the potential intestinal dysfunctions of IUGR piglets. We 
conclude that IUGR can lead to disparate DNA methylation in the intestine and 
these changes may affect several important biological processes such as cell 
apoptosis, cell differentiation, and immunity, which provides more clues linking 
IUGR and its long-term complications.","DOI: 10.1007/s00438-018-1422-9

membrane protein Omp25 in order to promote survival and immune evasion. However, 
how Omp25 regulates tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) expression in different 
mammalian macrophages remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the 
potential mechanisms by which Omp25 regulates TNF-α expression and found that 
Omp25-deficient mutant of B. suis exhibited an enhanced TNF-α expression 
compared with wild-type (WT) B. suis, whereas ectopic expression of Omp25 
suppressed LPS-induced TNF-α production at both protein and mRNA levels in 
porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. We 
observed that Omp25 protein as well as WT B. suis upregulated miR-146a, -181a, 
-181b, and -301a-3p and downregulated TRAF6 and IRAK1 in both PAMs and RAW264.7 
cells, but separately upregulates miR-130a-3p in PAMs and miR-351-5p in 
RAW264.7. The upregulation of miR-146a or miR-351-5p attenuated TNF-α 
transcription by targeting TRAF6 and IRAK1 at the 3' untranslated region (UTR), 
resulting in inhibition of NF-kB pathway, while upregulation of miR-130a-3p, 
-181a, or -301a-3p correlated temporally with decreased TNF-α by targeting its 
3'UTR in PAMs or RAW264.7 cells. In contrast, inhibition of miR-130a-3p, -146a, 
-181a, and -301a-3p attenuated the inhibitory effects of Omp25 on LPS-induced 
TNF-α in PAMs, while inhibition of miR-146a, -181a, -301a-3p, and -351-5p 
attenuated the inhibitory effects of Omp25 in RAW264.7, resulting in an 
increased TNF-α production and decreased intracellular bacteria in both cells.

since the eighteenth century, the generation of therapeutic vaccines and 
immunotherapies is still a work in progress. A number of challenges impede the 
development of these therapeutic approaches such as safety issues related to the 
administration of whole pathogens whether attenuated or inactivated. One safe 
alternative to classical vaccination methods gaining recognition is the use of 
nanoparticles, whether synthetic or naturally derived. We have recently 
demonstrated that the papaya mosaic virus (PapMV)-like nanoparticle can be used 
as a prophylactic vaccine against various viral and bacterial infections through 
the induction of protective humoral and cellular immune responses. Moreover, 
PapMV is also very efficient when used as an immune adjuvant in an 
immunotherapeutic setting at slowing down the growth of aggressive mouse 
melanoma tumors in a type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent manner. In the present 
study, we were interested in exploiting the capacity of PapMV of inducing robust 
IFN-I production as treatment for the chronic viral infection model lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13 (Cl13). Treatment of LCMV Cl13-infected 
mice with two systemic administrations of PapMV was ineffective, as shown by the 
lack of changes in viral titers and immune response to LCMV following treatment. 
Moreover, IFN-α production following PapMV administration was almost completely 
abolished in LCMV-infected mice. To better isolate the mechanisms at play, we 
determined the influence of a pretreatment with PapMV on secondary PapMV 
administration, therefore eliminating potential variables emanating from the 
infection. Pretreatment with PapMV led to the same outcome as an LCMV infection 
in that IFN-α production following secondary PapMV immunization was abrogated 
for up to 50 days while immune activation was also dramatically impaired. We 
showed that two distinct and overlapping mechanisms were responsible for this 
outcome. While short-term inhibition was partially the result of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 degradation, a crucial component of the toll-like 
receptor 7 signaling pathway, long-term inhibition was mainly due to 
interference by PapMV-specific antibodies. Thus, we identified a possible 
pitfall in the use of virus-like particles for the systemic treatment of chronic 
viral infections and discuss mitigating alternatives to circumvent these 
potential problems.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01885

of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). MicroRNA (miR)-146a-5p is a key 
regulator of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/TLR4 signaling, but its role in modulation 
of RILD remains unclear. Here, we found that irradiation and LPS stimulation 
induced TLR4 and miR-146a-5p expression in the human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) 
line LX2. Ectopic expression of miR-146a-5p in LX2 inhibited irradiation-induced

promoted cell apoptosis by down-regulating the expression levels of TLR4, 
interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), tumor necrosis factor 
receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa 
B. In addition, the culture medium from the irradiated and LPS-stimulated HSCs 
transfected with miR-146a-5p significantly attenuated apoptosis in irradiated 
hepatocytes. Overexpression of miR-146a-5p reduced α-smooth muscle actin

regulation of periodontitis. However, it is unclear whether and how miRs 
regulate the function of B cells in the context of periodontitis. This study is 
to explore the role of miR-146a on the inflammatory cytokine production of B 
cells challenged by Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS). Primary B cells were harvested from mouse spleen. Quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were 
used to detect the expression of inflammatory cytokines in B cells in the 
presence or absence of P. gingivalis LPS and/or miR-146a. Bioinformatics, 
luciferase reporter assay and overexpression assay were used to explore the 
binding target of miR-146a. Our results showed that miR-146a level in B cells 
was elevated by P. gingivalis LPS stimulation, and the mRNA expressions of 
interleukin (IL)-1β, 6 and 10, and IL-1 receptor associated kinase-1 (IRAK1), 
but not TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), were also upregulated. The 
expression levels of IL-1β, 6, 10 and IRAK1 were reduced in the presence of 
miR-146a mimic, but were elevated by the addition of miR-146a inhibitor. 
MiR-146a could bind with IRAK1 3' untranslated region (UTR) but not TRAF6 
3'-UTR. Overexpression of IRAK1 reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-146a on

extracellular bacteria and fungi, and as such play critical regulatory roles in 
maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Conversely, Th17 cells and their effector 
molecules interleukin 17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, interferon (IFN)γ, tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are 
implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Interactions between 
Th17 cells and other immune cells or stromal cells that are present in the 
synovial tissue during the earliest phases of the disease, may eventually lead 
to chronic inflammation, irreversible cartilage degradation and bone erosions. 
Recent evidence points towards Th17 cell plasticity as an essential contributing 
process in RA pathology, since Th17 cells are able to adopt a pathogenic 
phenotype under the influence of environmental, inflammatory and genetic 
factors. A remarkable feature of this pathogenic Th17 cell phenotype is the high 
production of GM-CSF and TNFα and the co-appearance of Th1 cell characteristics, 
such as transcription factor T-box 21 (T-bet) and IFNγ expression. Recently, 
much progress has been made in unravelling the mechanisms underlying Th17 cell 
plasticity and pathogenicity. Of interest, many of the environmental and 
inflammatory factors associated with RA pathology, such as pro-inflammatory 
mediators and cytokines, microbiome dysbiosis, metabolism and diet, obesity, 
vitamins, steroids and hormones are linked to the development of pathogenic Th17 
cells. Moreover proteins encoded by established genetic risk factors for RA 
including CCR6, CD226, CSF2, EOMES, ETS1, GATA3, IL2, IL6R, IL23R, IKZF3, IRAK1, 
IRF4, IRF8, PRKCQ, PRDM1, RBPJ, RUNX1 and TAGAP are directly involved in Th17 
cell differentiation and/or function. This review provides a detailed overview 
of the molecular mechanisms involved in the heterogeneity and pathogenicity of 
Th17 cells in the context of autoimmune diseases, with a focus on RA. 
Understanding these mechanisms creates great potential to identify and select 
novel therapeutic targets which could improve current therapies or lead to

kinases that play critical roles in initiating innate immune responses against 
foreign pathogens and other types of dangers through their role in Toll-like 
receptor (TLR) and interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) mediated signaling pathways. 
Upon ligand binding, TLRs and IL-1Rs recruit adaptor proteins, such as myeloid 
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), to the membrane, which in turn 
recruit IRAKs via the death domains in these proteins to form the Myddosome 
complex, leading to IRAK kinase activation. Despite their biological and 
clinical significance, only the IRAK4 kinase domain structure has been 
determined among the four IRAK family members. Here, we report the crystal 
structure of the human IRAK1 kinase domain in complex with a small molecule 
inhibitor. The structure reveals both similarities and differences between IRAK1 
and IRAK4 and is suggestive of approaches to develop IRAK1- or IRAK4-specific 
inhibitors for potential therapeutic applications. While the IRAK4 kinase domain 
is capable of homodimerization in the unphosphorylated state, we found that the 
IRAK1 kinase domain is constitutively monomeric regardless of its 
phosphorylation state. Additionally, the IRAK1 kinase domain forms heterodimers 
with the phosphorylated, but not unphosphorylated, IRAK4 kinase domain. 
Collectively, these data indicate a two-step kinase activation process in which 
the IRAK4 kinase domain first homodimerizes in the Myddosome, leading to its 
trans-autophosphorylation and activation. The phosphorylated IRAK4 kinase domain 
then forms heterodimers with the IRAK1 kinase domain within the Myddosome, 
leading to its subsequent phosphorylation and activation.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1714386114

factor α (TNF-α), a proinflammatory cytokine, has complex effects on the 
proliferation and growth of cancer cells. Previously, we treated a laryngeal 
cancer cell line (HEp-2) with TNF-α and demonstrated that this treatment 
suppressed polycystin-2, a transient receptor potential cation channel 
expression and ATP-induced Ca2+ release but increased HEp-2 cell proliferation 
and growth. However, the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the TNF-α 
effects on the HEp-2 cells were unclear. Therefore, we here used RNA-seq 
techniques to examine the effect of TNF-α on the gene transcript expression 
profile in these cells. We found that TNF-α treatment (100 ng/mL, 24 h) 
upregulated 2,811 genes and downregulated 1,128 genes. The IRAK1 gene encoding 
an effector protein downstream of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was ranked 19th in 
the upregulated differentially expressed genes. In a gene ontology (GO) 
analysis, 168 GO terms were identified in the biological process domain for the 
upregulated differentially expressed genes, and cell cycle and DNA replication 
functions were enriched. In a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathway analysis, TNF-α treatment enhanced the NF-κB pathway in HEp-2 cells. 
Moreover, both the transcript and protein expression levels of TLR4 as well as 
the expression of genes encoding downstream TLR4 effectors were significantly 
increased in TNF-α-treated HEp-2 cells. We concluded that TNF-α increased HEp-2 
cell proliferation and growth likely via enhancing TLR4- and NF-κB-associated 
signaling pathways and that TNF-α may play an important role in the development

or infection by migrating to affected locations and secreting inflammatory 
molecules. However, hyperactivated microglial is neurotoxic and plays critical 
roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Pristimerin, a 
naturally occurring triterpenoid, possesses antitumor, antioxidant, and 
anti-inflammatory activities. However, the effect and the molecular mechanism of 
pristimerin against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neurotoxicity in microglia 
remain to be revealed. In the present study, using BV-2 microglial cultures, we 
investigated whether pristimerin modifies neurotoxicity after LPS stimulation 
and which intracellular pathways are involved in the effect of pristimerin. Here 
we show that pristimerin markedly suppressed the release of Regulated on 
Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), transforming growth 
factor-β1 (TGF-β1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and nitric oxide 
(NO). Pristimerin also significantly inhibited migration of BV-2 microglia and 
alleviated the death of neuron-like PC12 cell induced by the conditioned medium 
from LPS-activated BV-2 microglial cells. Moreover, pristimerin reduced the 
expression and interaction of TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) and 
Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases (IRAK1), limiting TGF-beta activating 
kinase 1 (TAK1) activation, and resulting in an inhibition of IKKα/β/NF-κB and 
MKK7/JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia. Taken together, 
the anti-neurotoxicity action of pristimerin is mediated through the inhibition 
of TRAF6/IRAK1/TAK1 interaction as well as the related pathways: IKKα/β/NF-κB 
and MKK7/JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways. These findings may suggest that 
pristimerin might serve as a new therapeutic agent for treating hyperactivated

Africa, and is endemic to areas where people are chronically co-infected with 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. The 
contribution of these pathogens in the oncogenic process remains poorly 
understood. We showed earlier that the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 
by hemozoin, a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by P. 
falciparum, suppresses the lytic reactivation of EBV in BL cells. EBV lytic 
reactivation is regulated by the expression of transcription factor Zta (ZEBRA), 
encoded by the EBV gene BZLF1. Here, we explore in the BL cell line Akata, the 
mechanism involved in repression by TLR9 of expression of BZLF1. We show that 
BZLF1 repression is mediated upon TLR9 engagement by a mechanism that is largely 
independent of de novo protein synthesis. By CRISPR/Cas9-induced inactivation of 
TLR9, MyD88, IRAK4 and IRAK1 we confirm that BZLF1 repression is dependent on 
functional TLR9 and MyD88 signaling, and identify IRAK4 as an essential element 
for TLR9-induced repression of BZLF1 expression upon BCR cross-linking. Our 
results unprecedentedly show that TLR9-mediated inhibition of lytic EBV is 
largely independent of new protein synthesis and demonstrate the central roles

regulome could affect microRNAs-mediated regulation. Therefore, in the present 
study we were aimed at (1) comparison of microRNA 146-a (miR-146a) peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma levels between diabetic patients and 
controls, and (2) investigating the possible association of rs2910164 with 
miR-146a and its related target genes expression and also serum cytokine levels.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 60 subjects including 30 type 2 
diabetes (T2D) patients and 30 controls with determined genotypes for rs2910164. 
The RNA expression levels were determined by real-time PCR. Moreover, TNF-α, 
IL-6, IL-10 and IL-1β serum levels were measured using ELISA method.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the miR-146a expression levels were 
significantly decreased in PBMCs (P = 0.004) and plasma (P = 0.008) samples of 
patients with T2D compared to healthy participants. In addition, we observed 
that IRAK1 mRNA expression-but not TLR4, TRAF6 and NFĸB-was significantly

Nod-like receptors (NLRs) have the ability to recognize Aspergillus fumigatus 
(A. fumigates) and induce innate immune response. Dectin-1 is a well-described 
CLR, while interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (Irak1) and 
receptor-interacting protein 2 (Rip2) are pivotal adaptor proteins of TLRs and 
NLRs signaling pathways, respectively.
OBJECTIVES: Our primary aim is to elucidate whether Dectin-1 regulates the 
expression of Irak1 and Rip2, and confirm that CLRs, TLRs, and NLRs pathways act 
synergistically in response to A. fumigatus infection.
METHODS: Pulmonary infection mouse models were established. Myeloid cells were 
differentiated in cell culture and examined by inverted microscopy, flow 
cytometry, and scanning electron microscopy. The relative mRNA levels were 
determined by qRT-PCR. The protein expression levels were determined by 
immunohistochemistry and Western blot.
RESULTS: The expression of Dectin-1, Irak1, Rip2, and phosphorylation level of 
nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 were induced by conidia in immunocompetent mice, 
while their expression and phosphorylation level were inhibited in 
immunocompromised mice after the administration of conidia. Conidia increased 
the expression of Dectin-1, Irak1, and Rip2 in myeloid cells, while Dectin-1 
silencing significantly reduced their expression.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that Dectin-1, Irak1, and Rip2 are involved 
in response to A. fumigatus infection. Dectin-1 modulates the expression of 
Irak1 and Rip2. Additionally, these three signaling pathways are interconnected, 
and CLRs pathway plays a dominant role against A. fumigatus invasion.","DOI: 10.1007/s11046-017-0210-0

admitted to Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang from September 2013 to September 
2015 were enrolled in the study. Carcinoma samples were obtained from each 
patient, and adjacent tissues were used as control samples to determine 
expression levels of miR-146a and miR146b by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. An 
analysis was conducted to find possible correlations between the miRNAs 
expression levels and clinicopathological features in the patients followed up 
for one year after diagnosis. Additionally, to examine the function of miR-146a 
and miR‑146b on TPC-1 cells, the expression of miRNAs was knocked down using 
specific siRNAs. MTT and Transwell assays were used to evaluate cell 
proliferation and migration, respectively, in the miRNA cell lines. Finally, 
western blot analysis was used to analyze the expression of IRAK1 in PTC cancer 
cells. Our results showed that the expression levels of miR-146a and miR-146b in 
carcinoma tissues were significantly higher than the levels in cancer-free 
tissues (p<0.01). The relative expression levels of miR-146a and miR-146b in 
cancerous tissues could be associated with the pathological type and presence or 
absence of lymph node metastasis (p<0.05). Compared with the siRNA-control cell, 
MTT and Transwell assays showed that the cell growth and migration of TPC-1 
cells were decreased in miR-146a and miR-146b low expression cells (p<0.01).

by various posttranslational modifications. Recently, transcription-independent 
functions for glucocorticoids (GC) in restraining inflammation have emerged, but 
the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we report that GC receptor 
(GR)-mediated actions of GC acutely suppress TLR9-induced inflammation via 
inhibition of IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) ubiquitination. β-TrCP-IRAK1 
interaction is required for K48-linked ubiquitination of IRAK1 at Lys134 and 
subsequent membrane-to-cytoplasm trafficking of IRAK1 interacting partners 
TNFR-associated factor 6 and TAK1 that facilitates NF-κB and MAPK activation. 
Upon costimulation of macrophages with GC and TLR9-engaging ligand, GR 
physically interacts with IRAK1 and interferes with protein-protein interactions 
between β-TrCP and IRAK1. Ablation of GR in macrophages prevents GC-dependent 
suppression of β-TrCP-IRAK1 interactions. This GC-mediated suppression of IRAK1 
activation is unique to TLR9, as GC treatment impairs TLR9 but not TLR4 
ligand-induced K48-linked IRAK1 ubiquitination and trafficking of IRAK1 
interacting partners. Furthermore, mutations in IRAK1 at Lys134 prevent TLR9 
ligand-induced activation of inflammatory signaling mediators and synthesis of 
proinflammatory cytokines to an extent comparable to GC-mediated inhibition. 
Collectively, these findings identify a transcription-independent, rapid, and 
nongenomic GC suppression of TLR9 ligand-mediated IRAK1 ubiquitination as a 
novel mechanism for restraining acute inflammatory reactions.","Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1700443

in controlling immune functions with emphasis on their significance, function, 
regulation and expression patterns. The tripartite TLRs are type I integral 
transmembrane receptors that are involved in recognition and conveying of 
pathogens to the immune system. These paralogs are located on cell surfaces or 
within endosomes. The TLRs are found to be functionally involved in the 
recognition of self and non-self-antigens, maturation of DCs and initiation of 
antigen-specific adaptive immune responses as they bridge the innate and 
adaptive immunity. Interestingly, they also have a significant role in 
immunotherapy and vaccination. Signals generated by TLRs are transduced through 
NFκB signaling and MAP kinases pathway to recruit pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
co-stimulatory molecules, which promote inflammatory responses. The excess 
production of these cytokines leads to grave systemic disorders like tumor 
growth and autoimmune disorders. Hence, regulation of the TLR signaling pathway 
is necessary to keep the host system safe. Many molecules like LPS, SOCS1, 
IRAK1, NFκB, and TRAF3 are involved in modulating the TLR pathways to induce 
appropriate response. Though quantification of these TLRs helps in correlating 
the magnitude of immune response exhibited by the animal, there are several 
internal, external, genetic and animal factors that affect their expression 
patterns. So it can be concluded that any identification based on those 
expression profiles may lead to improper diagnosis during certain conditions.","DOI: 10.1080/08830185.2017.1380200

pancreatitis (SAP) in rats and its related mechanism.
METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five 
groups (n = 12 in each group): sham group, SAP model group, dexamethasone group 
(5 mg/kg), low and high dose of hesperidin groups (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg). SAP 
rats were administered a retrograde infusion of 3.5% sodium taurocholate 
solution into the biliopancreatic duct after laparotomy. Sham rats were 
administered with equivalent saline. The treatment was intravenously injected 5 
minutes after operation through femoral vein. After 24 hours, the survival of 
animals was observed, the level of serum amylase, the volume of ascites and the 
relative specific gravity of the pancreas were measured; the pathological 
changes of pancreatic tissue were observed by Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining; 
the levels of serum and pancreatic tissue interleukin (IL-1β, IL-6) and tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA); the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the phosphorylation of 
IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were 
detected by Western Blot.
RESULTS: Compared with SAP model group, the 24-hour survival rate were increased 
in low and high dose of hesperidin groups (83.3%, 100% vs. 58.3%), the volume of 
ascites were reduced (mL: 7.36±0.91, 6.10±1.02 vs. 13.82±2.06), the levels of 
serum amylase were reduced (U/L: 1 081.48±78.23, 1 048.58±49.97 vs. 1 
990.37±127.27), the relative specific gravity of the pancreas were reduced 
[(7.52±1.02)%, (5.59±0.96)% vs. (11.22±0.96)%], and the pathological damage of 
pancreatic tissue were reduced; the levels of serum and pancreatic tissue 
inflammatory factors were reduced in high dose hesperidin group [serum IL-1β 
(ng/L): 68.08±10.49 vs. 130.30±23.35, IL-6 (ng/L): 63.88±10.47 vs. 158.41±21.38, 
TNF-α (ng/L): 10.42±1.49 vs. 18.16±2.01; pancreas IL-1β (pg/μg): 13.87±1.84 vs. 
20.08±1.66, IL-6 (pg/μg): 21.90±3.12 vs. 38.13±3.57, TNF-α (pg/μg): 1.88±0.20 
vs. 4.26±0.58]; the expression of TLR4, and the phosphorylation levels of IRAK1 
and NF-κB were decreased in low and high dose of hesperidin groups (the sham 
operation group was 100, TLR4/β-actin: 91.9±15.6, 83.7±11.2 vs. 168.5±9.0, 
p-IRAK1/IRAK1: 117.4±7.6, 104.7±11.5 vs. 173.5±15.8, p-NF-κB p65/NF-κB p65: 
119.9±9.3, 105.8±12.6 vs. 174.1±13.0), with statistically significant 
differences (all P < 0.05). The effects of dexamethasone were similar to that of 
high dose of hesperidin.
CONCLUSIONS: Hesperidin could significantly protect SAP rats, and this 
protection was related to the inhibition of TLR4/IRAK1/NF-κB signaling pathway, 
and to the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions. The effect of 
high dose hesperidin (20 mg/kg) was more significant.","DOI: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.2095-4352.2017.10.012

unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that TLR2 can enhance inflammatory 
reactions in HCAECs after stimulated by TLR2 agonist. First, we used CRISPR-Cas9 
technology to knockout TLR2 gene in HCAECs. Then, TLR2-KO and wild type HCAECs

Previous studies have investigated the altered expression of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) in various cancers. We aimed at exploring 
the biological function and the underlying molecular mechanism of IRAK1 in EC. 
In this study, IRAK1 was found elevated in EC compared with normal tissues. 
Further, high IRAK1 expression level was correlated with higher tumor stage, 
lymph node metastasis, myometrial invasion, and lower survival rate. Knockdown 
of IRAK1 in two EC cell lines, HEC-1-B and JEC, significantly inhibited cell 
proliferation in vitro and in vivo. We also found that down-regulation of IRAK1 
in EC cells notably induced cell cycle arrest and apoptois, and also inhibited 
cell migration and invasion. Gene set enrichment analysis on The Cancer Genome 
Atlas dataset showed that Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mitotic 
cell cycle and cell division pathways were correlative with the IRAK1 
expression, which was further confirmed in EC cells by Western blot. The 
expression of mitotic cell cycle (CDK1 and Cdc45) and cell division pathway 
(Cdc7 and MCM2) related factors was significantly suppressed by IRAK1 knockdown. 
These collective data indicated that IRAK1 overexpression promotes EC 
tumorigenesis by activating mitotic cell cycle and cell division pathways, and 
IRAK1 may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for EC.","© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","DOI: 10.1002/jcb.26416

high risk of recurrence. Here we report the identification of chromosomal 
copy-number amplification at 1q21.3 that is enriched in subpopulations of breast 
cancer cells bearing characteristics of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and that 
strongly associates with breast cancer recurrence. Amplification is present in 
∼10-30% of primary tumors but in more than 70% of recurrent tumors, regardless 
of breast cancer subtype. Detection of amplification in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
from blood is strongly associated with early relapse in patients with breast

28d. And mice in AA groups were gavaged with AA (20 or 40mg/kg) for 28d. AA 
treatment significantly decreased serum AST and TG, hepatic TG levels, serum 
ethanol and LPS levels compared with chronic ethanol administration. AA 
ameliorated histological changes, lipid droplets, hepatic fibrosis, and 
inflammation induced by ethanol. AA significantly increased the expressions of 
p-LKB1, p-AMPK, and SIRT1 caused by chronic ethanol administration, and 
attenuated the increasing protein expressions of IRAK1 and IRAK4.siRNA against 
AMPKα1 blocked AMPKα1 and increased IRAK4 protein expressions, compared with 
control-siRNA-transfected group, while AA treatment significantly decreased 
IRAK4 expressions compared with AMPKα1-siRNA-transfected group. AMPK-siRNA also 
blocked the decreased effect of AA on inflammatory factors. AA decreased 
over-expression of IRAK4 and inflammation under ethanol plus LPS challenge. AA 
recruited LKB1-AMPK phosphorylation and activated SIRT1 to regulate alcoholic 
liver injury, especially, inhibited IRAK1/4 signaling pathway to regulate lipid 
metabolism, hepatic fibrosis and inflammation caused by alcohol consumption.",Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.09.020

electrical resistance, the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1) 
in mRNA and protein levels, and decreased FD4 and the mRNA expression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β). The pro-inflammatory 
signaling pathways results demonstrated that Cu/Zn-Mt supplementation decreased 
the mRNA levels of TLR4 and its downstream signals (MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6) but had 
no effect on NOD1 and NOD2 signals. Cu/Zn-Mt supplementation did not affect 
NF-κB p65 mRNA abundance, but down-regulated its protein expression. The 
anti-inflammatory signaling pathways results showed supplemental Cu/Zn-Mt also 
increased TβRII, Smad4 and Smad7 mRNA expressions. These findings suggested

induction of a variety of inflammatory genes is elicited by activation of a 
myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent signaling 
pathway. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) plays an 
essential role in this pathway by activating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and 
mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs). Here, we identified optineurin (OPTN) as an 
IRAK1-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid screening using IRAK1 as bait. A 
C-terminal fragment of OPTN harboring a ubiquitin-binding domain was 
co-immunoprecipitated with IRAK1. In reporter analyses, overexpression of OPTN 
inhibited IL-1β-, IRAK1-, and LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Consistently, OPTN 
deficiency resulted in increased NF-κB activation in response to IL-1β/LPS 
stimulation. To address the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of OPTN 
on NF-κB signaling, we focused on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which is an adaptor protein of IRAK1 and 
upon polyubiquitination plays a crucial role during NF-κB activation. 
Overexpression of OPTN prevented TRAF6 polyubiquitination. Furthermore, OPTN 
H486R mutant, which is unable to recruit the deubiquitinase CYLD, failed to 
inhibit IRAK1-induced NF-κB activation. These results suggest that the 
IRAK1-binding protein OPTN negatively regulates IL-1β/LPS-induced NF-κB 
activation by preventing polyubiquitination of TRAF6.","© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M117.813899

METHODS: Forty adult male Wistar rats were allocated randomly into four groups 
(n=10), including sedentary control (SC), sedentary diabetic (SD), healthy 
sixty-day exercise (H60E), and diabetic sixty-day exercise (D60E) groups. 
Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg streptozotocin. 
After 48 h, blood glucose levels >250 mg/dl was included to diabetic rats. After 
2 days of diabetes induction, the exercise protocol began. Animals were exposed 
to 5 days of consecutive treadmill exercise for 60 min/day with the 22 m/min 
speed for 60 days. The kidneys of the rats were removed and microRNA was 
extracted from them using the miRCURYTM RNA isolation kit.
RESULTS: In diabetic rats, statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease 
in miR-146a expression, non-significant decrease in IRAK1 mRNA expression, and 
non-significant increase in TRAF6 and NF-kB mRNA expression compared to the SC 
group. Exercise led to a non-significant increase in the expression of miR-146a

significant increase in TRAF6 and IRAK1 mRNA expression compared to the H60E 
group, and significant increase in TRAF6 mRNA expression compared to the SD

critical for mediating toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 receptor signaling. 
In this study, we have examined whether IRAK-1 expression is altered in high 
glucose (HG)-stimulated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), and whether 
microRNAs (miRs) target IRAK-1 to regulate HG-induced endothelial inflammation. 
Methods: HAECs were treated with HG for 24 and 48 h. Real-time PCR, Western 
blot, monocyte adhesion assay, bioinformatics analysis, TaqMan® arrays, microRNA 
mimic or inhibitor transfection, luciferase reporter assay and siRNA IRAK-1 
transfection were performed. The aortic tissues from db/db type 2 diabetic mice 
were examined by immunohistochemistry staining. Results: HG time-dependently 
increased IRAK-1 mRNA and protein levels in HAECs, and was associated with 
increased VCAM-1/ICAM-1 gene expression and monocyte adhesion. Bioinformatic 
analysis, TaqMan® arrays, and real-time PCR were used to confirm that 
miR-146a-5p, miR-339-5p, and miR-874-3p were significantly downregulated in 
HG-stimulated HAECs, suggesting impaired feedback restraints on HG-induced 
endothelial inflammation via IRAK-1. However, only miR-146a-5p mimic 
transfection reduced the HG-induced upregulation of IRAK-1 expression, 
VCAM-1/ICAM-1 expression, and monocyte adhesion. Additionally, IRAK-1 depletion 
reduced HG-induced VCAM-1/ICAM-1 gene expression, and monocyte adhesion, 
indicating that HG-induced endothelial inflammation was mediated partially 
through IRAK-1. In vivo, intravenous injections of miR-146a-5p mimic prevented 
endothelial IRAK-1 and ICAM-1 expression in db/db mice. Conclusion: These 
results suggest that miR-146a-5p is involved in the regulation of HG-induced 
endothelial inflammation via modulation of IRAK-1; indicating that miR-146a-5p 
may be a novel target for the treatment of diabetic vascular complications.","DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2017.00551

molecular brake, preventing immune overreaction and malignant transformation by 
attenuating NF-κB signaling, putatively via repression of the Traf6 and Irak1 
genes. The exact contribution of miR-146a-mediated silencing of these genes to 
the control of immune activation is currently unknown. Therefore, we defined the

homeostasis using a genetic epistasis analysis in miR-146a-/- mice. We have 
uncovered a surprising separation of functions at the level of miR-146a targets. 
Lowering the Traf6 gene dose and consequent attenuation of NF-κB activation 
rescued several significant miR-146a-/- phenotypes, such as splenomegaly, 
aberrant myeloproliferation, and excessive inflammatory responses. In contrast, 
decreasing Traf6 expression had no effect on the development of the progressive 
bone marrow failure phenotype, as well as lymphomagenesis in miR-146a-/- mice,

in the development of Behcet's disease.
METHODS: Twenty-eight Behcet's patients and thirty-two normal subjects were 
involved in this study. The mRNA levels of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from active Behcet's 
patients, inactive Behcet's patients and normal controls were detected using 
real-time quantitative PCR. CD4+T cells were extracted from peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells of active Behcet's patients and normal controls. After 
coculturing IRAK1/4 inhibitor with CD4+T cells in the presence of rIL-18 protein 
or rIL-1β protein for 3 days, the proliferation of CD4+T cells was measured 
using a modified MTT assay. Meanwhile, the levels of IFN-γ and IL-17 were 
detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The mRNA levels of IRAK1 and IRAK4 were both significantly increased in 
active Behcet's patients compared with those of inactive Behcet's patients and 
normal subjects. However, there was no difference of IRAK1 mRNA level or the 
IRAK4 mRNA level between the inactive Behcet's patients and normal controls. 
After coculturing with IRAK1/4 inhibitor, the proliferation of the CD4+T cells 
was inhibited both in active Behcet's patients and in normal controls. 
Meanwhile, the expression of IFN-γ and IL-17 was also suppressed by IRAK1/4 
inhibitor both in active Behcet's patients and in normal subjects.
CONCLUSION: The high mRNA levels of IRAK1 and IRAK4 were correlated with the 
development of Behcet's disease, which suggested that IRAK1 and IRAK4 might 
participate in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease. The inhibitory function of 
IRAK1/4 inhibitor prompts that it may be a new therapeutic target for treating 
this blindness disease.","DOI: 10.1007/s10792-017-0682-4

inflammation. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is required to combat the 
infection that underlies many ARDS cases but also contributes to pathological 
inflammation. Several TLR signaling pathway genes encoding positive effectors of 
inflammation also produce alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding negative 
regulators of inflammation. An imbalance between these isoforms could contribute 
to pathological inflammation and disease severity. To determine whether splicing 
in TLR pathways is altered in patients with ARDS, we monitored alternative 
splicing of MyD88 and IRAK1, two genes that function in multiple TLR pathways. 
The MyD88 and IRAK1 genes produce long proinflammatory mRNAs (MyD88L and IRAK1) 
and shorter anti-inflammatory mRNAs (MyD88S and IRAK1c). We quantified mRNA 
encoding inflammatory cytokines and MyD88 and IRAK1 isoforms in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 104 patients with ARDS and 30 healthy control 
subjects. We found that MyD88 pre-mRNA splicing is altered in patients with ARDS 
in a proinflammatory direction. We also observed altered MyD88 isoform levels in 
a second critically ill patient cohort, suggesting that these changes may not be 
unique to ARDS. Early in ARDS, PBMC IRAK1c levels were associated with patient 
survival. Despite the similarities in MyD88 and IRAK1 alternative splicing 
observed in previous in vitro studies, there were differences in how MyD88 and 
IRAK1 alternative splicing was altered in patients with ARDS. We conclude that 
pre-mRNA splicing of TLR signaling genes is altered in patients with ARDS, and 
further investigation of altered splicing may lead to novel prognostic and

stellate cells (HSCs). Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) is crucial for

(miR-146a-5p) could regulate TGFβ1/Smad and LPS/NF-κB/Bambi pathways to 
attenuate liver fibrosis. Downregulated miR-146a-5p and upregulated level of LPS 
were found in liver of CCl4-treated rats. On cellular level, expression of 
miR-146a-5p is reduced during primary rat HSCs naturally activation and changed 
in response to TGFβ1 and/or LPS stimulation in primary rat HSCs and human HSC 
line LX-2. Further overexpression of miR-146a-5p suppresses proliferation and 
activation of HSCs. The underlying mechanism involved that miR-146a-5p directly 
suppresses profibrogenic effects of TGFβ1 by down-regulating the expression of 
Smad4 and phosphorylation of Smad2. Moreover, miR-146a-5p indirectly suppresses 
TGFβ1/Smad pathway by targeting IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and

response. We hypothesized that an inflammation-mediated dysregulation of these 
miRNAs may occur in patients with Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).
METHODS: The miRNA expression patterns were investigated by in situ 
hybridization in developing hippocampus from controls, patients with DS and in 
adults with AD pathology (DS and sporadic AD; sAD). Quantitative real-time PCR 
was employed to evaluate the miRNA levels in the hippocampus of sAD and in mouse 
models of DS and AD. Both miRNAs were expressed in prenatal human hippocampus. 
In DS we detected increased miR-146a expression in reactive astrocytes. 
Increased expression of miR-146a was found in the hippocampus of sAD and 
negatively correlated with its target IRAK-1. APP/PS1 mice showed a significant 
increase in the expression of both miRNAs at 11-13 months of age as compared to 
WT and mice at 3 months. A negative correlation between miR-146a levels and its 
target TRAF6 was observed in both Ts65Dn and APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a possible involvement of miR-146a and 
miR-155 in brain development and neurodegeneration. In particular, we provide 
evidence of a dysregulation of these two immunomodulatory miRNAs in AD with a 
potential therapeutical implication, deserving further investigation.","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at

by other enzymes activated by toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, we investigated the 
possibility that spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a protein tyrosine kinase that is 
activated at an earlier stage during TLR4 activation, plays a central role in 
regulating the functional activation of IRAK1. Indeed, we found that 
overexpression of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), an 
adaptor molecule that drives TLR signaling, induced IRAK1 expression and that 
piceatannol, a Syk inhibitor, successfully suppressed the MyD88-dependent 
upregulation of IRAK1 under LPS treatment conditions. Interestingly, in 
Syk-knockout RAW264.7 cells, IRAK1 activity was almost completely blocked after 
LPS treatment, while providing a Syk-recovery gene to the knockout cells 
successfully restored IRAK1 expression. According to our measurements of IRAK1 
mRNA levels, the transcriptional upregulation of IRAK1 was induced by LPS 
treatment between 4 and 60 min, and this can be suppressed in Syk knockout 
cells, providing an effect similar that that seen under piceatannol treatment. 
The overexpression of Syk reverses this effect and leads to a significantly 
higher IRAK1 mRNA level. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that Syk 
plays a critical role in regulating both the activity and transcriptional level

upstream of the NF-κB pathway components TRAF2, TRAF6, and TAK1. Since SH 
coimmunoprecipitated with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), RIP1, and 
IRAK1, we hypothesize that SH exerts its inhibitory function by interacting with 
TNFR1, interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), and TLR3 complexes in the plasma 
membrane of infected cells.IMPORTANCE The MuV SH has been shown to impede 
TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation and is therefore thought to contribute to viral 
immune evasion. However, the mechanisms by which SH mediates NF-κB inhibition 
remained largely unknown. In this study, we show that SH interacts with TNFR1, 
IL-1R1, and TLR3 complexes in infected cells. We thereby not only shed light on 
the mechanisms of SH-mediated NF-κB inhibition but also reveal that SH 
interferes with NF-κB activation induced by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and 
double-stranded RNA.",Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.,"DOI: 10.1128/JVI.01037-17

in rats.
METHODS: EIU in Wistar rats was developed by subcutaneous injection of LPS (200 
μg). Lower dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or its carrier was 
injected daily for five days before EIU induction. Twenty-four hours after EIU, 
eyes were examined and then enucleated. The degree of inflammatory reaction was 
determined by routine histological examinations. Real-time RT-PCR and Western 
blot were used to determine the activation of NF-kB and expression of IRAK-1, 
IRAK-4, and IRAK-M Results: Repeated pre-administration of LPS induced a 
significant reduction in ocular inflammation and the expression of NF-κb p65 in 
neurons. The expression of IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 was suppressed in endotoxin 
tolerance group, whereas IRAK-M was increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Endotoxin tolerance has a protective effect against EIU, and 
upregulation of IRAK-M through TLR-signaling pathway is one of the most likely 
candidates to be involved in the observed phenomenon.","DOI: 10.1080/09273948.2017.1291842

Interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) mediates pro-inflammatory 
signaling via IL-1 receptor/Toll-like receptors, which may contribute to insulin 
resistance, but this hypothesis is untested. Here, we used male Irak1 null (k/o) 
mice to investigate the metabolic role of IRAK-1. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and k/o 
mice had comparable body weights on low-fat and high-fat diets (LFD and HFD, 
respectively). After 12 weeks on LFD (but not HFD), k/o mice (versus WT) had 
substantially improved glucose tolerance (assessed by the intraperitoneal 
glucose tolerance test (IPGTT)). As assessed with the hyperinsulinemic 
euglycemic glucose clamp technique, insulin sensitivity was 30% higher in the 
Irak1 k/o mice on chow diet, but the Irak1 deletion did not affect IPGTT 
outcomes in mice on HFD, suggesting that the deletion did not overcome the 
impact of obesity on glucose tolerance. Moreover, insulin-stimulated 
glucose-disposal rates were higher in the k/o mice, but we detected no 
significant difference in hepatic glucose production rates (± insulin infusion). 
Positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher insulin-stimulated 
glucose uptake in muscle, but not liver, in Irak1 k/o mice in vivo Moreover, 
insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt was higher in muscle, but not in 
liver, from Irak1 k/o mice ex vivo In conclusion, Irak1 deletion improved muscle 
insulin sensitivity, with the effect being most apparent in LFD mice.","© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M117.779108

During IL-1β treatment, LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of RCAN1 promoted the

decreased binding between Tollip and IRAK1, which was accompanied by increased

interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and IRAK4 reliably in human 
cell extracts, by employing Pellino1 as a substrate in conjunction with specific 
pharmacological inhibitors of IRAK1 and IRAK4. We exploited these assays to show 
that IRAK4 was constitutively active and that its intrinsic activity towards 
Pellino1 was not increased significantly by stimulation with interleukin-1 
(IL-1) in IL-1R-expressing HEK293 cells, Pam3CSK4-stimulated human THP1

of other investigators, suggest that the IL-1-stimulated

primary response gene 88-induced dimerization of IRAK4 and is not caused by an 
increase in the intrinsic catalytic activity of IRAK4. In contrast with IRAK4, 
we found that IRAK1 was inactive in unstimulated cells and converted into an 
active protein kinase in response to IL-1 or Pam3CSK4 in human cells. 
Surprisingly, the IL-1-stimulated activation of IRAK1 was not affected by 
pharmacological inhibition of IRAK4 and not reversed by dephosphorylation and/or 
deubiquitylation, suggesting that IRAK1 catalytic activity is not triggered by a 
covalent modification but by an allosteric mechanism induced by its interaction

responses in the spleen of Balb/c mice. The present investigation was carried 
out to study the impact of BA on macrophages, which are the primary scavenger 
cells in the body that act as a connecting link between innate and adaptive 
immunity. Parenteral administration of BA (daily for one week) to mice resulted 
in enhanced levels of nitric oxide (NO) and overexpression of inflammatory 
markers (COX-2, MMP-9 and PGE-2) in macrophages; however the level of MHC 
class-I and MHC class-II receptors were down regulated. Further, the potential 
membrane receptor targets (TLRs) of BA and its interaction with TLRs was 
investigated using computational methods. Professional phagocytes play pivotal 
roles in sensing bacteria through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 
by various pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs). Several studies have implicated these TLRs in the amplification of the 
inflammatory responses, however the fundamental role played by TLRs in mediating 
the inflammation associated with xenobiotics is still obscure and not 
understood. From the in silico analysis, it was evident that BA showed the 
highest binding affinity with TLR4 as compared to other TLRs. The western 
blotting studies confirmed that BA exposure indeed upregulated the expression of 
TLR 4, 5 and 9. Moreover, the downstream signaling cascade proteins of TLRs such 
as myeloid differentiation primary response protein-88 (MyD88), IL-1 receptor 
associated kinase (IRAK-1), and TNFR-associated factor (TRAF-6) were found to be 
enhanced in the BA treated groups. It was also observed that BA treatment 
increased the expression of ICAM-1, p-Lyn, p-Syk, p-PI3-K, IP3, PLC-γ, cAMP and 
Ca+2 influx, which are known to play a critical role in TLR mediated

pro-inflammatory mediators inhibit natural anticoagulant factors and initiate an 
increase in procoagulant activity. Previous studies proved the beneficial 
effects of heparin in pulmonary coagulopathy, which derive from its 
anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activities, although it is uncertain whether 
heparin works. Understanding the specific effect of unfractioned heparin on cell 
lung populations would be of interest to increase our knowledge about heparin 
pathways and to treat ARDS.
METHODS: In the current study, the effect of heparin was assessed in primary 
human alveolar macrophages (hAM), alveolar type II cells (hATII), and 
fibroblasts (hF) that had been injured with LPS.
RESULTS: Heparin did not produce any changes in the Smad/TGFß pathway, in any of 
the cell types evaluated. Heparin reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory 
markers (TNF-α and IL-6) in hAM and deactivated the NF-kß pathway in hATII, 
diminishing the expression of IRAK1 and MyD88 and their effectors, IL-6, MCP-1 
and IL-8.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that heparin significantly 
ameliorated the cells lung injury induced by LPS through the inhibition of 
pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages and the NF-kß pathway in 
alveolar cells. Our results suggested that a local pulmonary administration of 
heparin through nebulization may be able to reduce inflammation in the lung; 
however, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","DOI: 10.1186/s12931-017-0572-3

expression of microglial Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their downstream signal 
transducers play critical roles in determining microglial activation status. 
Emerging reports have also demonstrated that cocaine can enhance the strength of 
TLR signaling. Detailed molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, 
however, remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the role(s) of miR-124 
in regulating microglial TLR4 signaling in the context of cocaine. Herein, we 
found a dose- and time-dependent upregulation of KLF4 in cocaine-exposed BV-2 
cells and rat primary microglial cells (rPMs). KLF4 also identified as a novel 
3'-UTR target directly regulated by miR-124. In parallel, miR-124 regulated 
multiple TLR4 signaling molecules including TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, and IRAK1. 
Repeated doses of cocaine (20 mg/kg; i.p.) administration in mice for 7 days 
further validated the in vitro key findings. Also, miR-124 overexpression 
significantly blocked the cocaine-mediated upregulation of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines. In contrast, miR-124 overexpression notably increased the expression 
of anti-inflammatory mediators in cocaine-exposed microglial cells. 
Intriguingly, stereotactic administration of lentivirus-miR-124 in the striatum 
significantly inhibited cocaine-mediated microglial activation and locomotor 
hyperactivity in vivo. In summary, these findings implicate the role of miR-124 
in regulating TLR4 signaling, thereby indicating a new pathway responsible for 
cocaine-mediated microglial activation.","DOI: 10.1007/s12035-017-0584-5

(1)MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, School of Life Sciences, 
University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, UK.","The adaptor protein MyD88 is required for signal transmission by toll-like 
receptors and receptors of the interleukin-1 family of cytokines. MyD88 
signalling triggers the formation of Lys63-linked and Met1-linked ubiquitin 
(K63-Ub, M1-Ub) chains within minutes. The K63-Ub chains, which are formed by 
the E3 ubiquitin ligases TRAF6, Pellino1 and Pellino2, activate TAK1, the master 
kinase that switches on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades and 
initiates activation of the canonical IκB kinase (IKK) complex. The M1-Ub 
chains, which are formed by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), 
bind to the NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) component of the IKK complex and 
are required for TAK1 to activate IKKs, but not MAP kinases. An essential E3 
ligase-independent role of TRAF6 is to recruit LUBAC into the MyD88 signalling 
complex, where it recognises preformed K63-Ub chains attached to protein 
components of these complexes, such as IRAK1 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase), 
producing ubiquitin chains containing both types of linkage, termed K63/M1-Ub 
hybrids. The formation of K63/M1-Ub hybrids, which is a feature of several 
innate immune signalling pathways, permits the co-recruitment of proteins that 
interact with either K63-Ub or M1-Ub chains. Two likely roles for K63/M1-Ub 
hybrids are to facilitate the TAK1-dependent activation of the IKK complex and 
to prevent the hyperactivation of these kinases by recruiting A20 and 
A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB1 (ABIN1). These proteins restrict activation of 
the TAK1 and IKK complexes, probably by competing with them for binding to 
K63/M1-Ub hybrids. The formation of K63/M1-Ub hybrids may also regulate the rate 
at which the ubiquitin linkages in these chains are hydrolysed. The 
IKK-catalysed phosphorylation of some of its substrates permits their 
recognition by the E3 ligase SCFβTRCP, leading to their Lys48-linked 
ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Innate immune signalling is 
therefore controlled by the formation and destruction of three different types 
of ubiquitin linkage.","DOI: 10.1038/cdd.2017.17

expression of miRNA-146a/b was accompanied by an increase in the expression of 
and TRAF6 and a decrease in the expression of IRAK1 genes in the peripheral 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) 
patients. Recently, the expression of EBV encoded. RNA (EBER) was published in 
the B cells of salivary glands of in pSS. In the present study, we applied an 
EBV-EBER1 specific synthetic single stranded complementary DNA molecule 
(EBV-EBER1-cDNA) to test whether any EBER1 related effect exists also in PBMCs 
of pSS patients.
METHODS: In the PBMCs of pSS patients and healthy controls, we investigated in 
vitro the effects of a synthetic single stranded EBV-EBER1-cDNA molecule, 
synthetic double-stranded (ds)RNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] 
and polyadenylic acid potassium salt poly-adenylic acid [poly-(A)] on the 
expression of TRAF6 gene tested by qRTPCR. The release of interferon -α was 
detected by ELISA.
RESULTS: EBV-EBER1-cDNA resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of 
TRAF6 in the cells of patients, but in the healthy controls not, whereas the 
treatments with poly (I:C) and poly-(A) could not reduce the TRAF6 
over-expression. No release of EBER1 could be observed in the culture 
supernatants of patients with pSS. Only the treatment with poly (I:C) resulted 
in a significant increase of interferon -α release, and only in the heathy 
controls. No release of EBER1 molecules took place during the culturing of 
cells. EBV-EBER- cDNA acted functionally on the cells of patients only.
CONCLUSION: These findings give a further evidence of the linkage between EBV 
and pSS, furthermore, they show the possible role of EBV-EBER1 in the induction 
of increased TRAF6 expression in the peripheral B cells of Sjögren's patients.","© 2017 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley &

widely used as a traditional herbal medicine in Northeast Asia for treating 
inflammatory diseases.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of 
2-carbomethoxy-2,3-epoxy-3- prenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (CMEP-NQ), purified from 
the roots of R. cordifolia L. as the major anti-inflammatory component, in 
LPS-treated RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-inflammatory activity of CMEP-NQ was investigated in 
LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells by measuring the levels of NO, PGE2, and cytokines 
(IL1β, IL-6, TNF-α) in the culture supernatants and the TLR4-mediated 
intracellular events including association of MyD88 with IRAK1, activation of 
IRAK1, TAK1, MAPKs, NF-κB/AP-1, and IRF3, and generation of ROS.
RESULTS: Pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with CMEP-NQ reduced LPS-induced 
production of NO and PGE2 by suppressing iNOS and COX-2 gene expression. CMEP-NQ 
also reduced the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α by down-regulating mRNA 
levels. Under these conditions, TLR4-mediated MyD88-dependent events were 
inhibited by CMEP-NQ, including the association of MyD88 with IRAK1, 
phosphorylation of IRAK1, TAK1, and MAPKs (ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK), and 
activation of NF-κB and AP-1. As TRIF-dependent events of TLR4 signaling, 
phosphorylation of IRF3 and induction of iNOS protein expression were also 
inhibited by CMEP-NQ. However, the binding of FITC-conjugated LPS to cell 
surface TLR4 was not affected by CMEP-NQ. Following LPS stimulation, 
intracellular ROS production was first detected by DCFH-DA staining at 1h; then 
it continuously increased until 16h. Although CMEP-NQ failed to exhibit DPPH 
radical- or ABTS radical-scavenging activity in vitro, LPS-induced ROS 
production in RAW264.7 cells was more efficiently blocked by CMEP-NQ than by 
NAC.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the suppressive effect of CMEP-NQ on 
LPS-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 cells was mainly exerted via its 
inhibition of TLR4-mediated proximal events, such as MyD88-dependent NF-κB/AP-1 
activation and ROS production, and TRIF-dependent IRF3 activation.",Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2017.04.029

particularly gouty arthritis (GA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: the 
normal group, model group, colchicine group (COL) and three total saponin groups 
(RDN) (high dose [160mg/kg], middle dose [80mg/kg] and low dose [40mg/kg]). The 
mRNA and protein expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, IRAK1, TRAF6, TAK1, IKKα, IκBα 
and NF-κB in the synovial tissue of joint were detected by realtime PCR and WB 
methods respectively. The contents of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the blood serum 
were measured by Elisa method. The activation of NF-κB was measured by EMSA 
method.
RESULTS: Our study showed that RDN decreased both the mRNA and protein 
expressions of TLR2, TLR4, IRAK1, TRAF6, TAK1, IKKα, IκBα and NF-κB of the 
synovial tissue of joint of rats induced with monosodium urate crystal (MSU). 
They could also reduce the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the blood serum. 
Further, EMSA results showed that RDN reduced the DNA binding ability of NF-κB 
p65 of model group.

increased incidence of tuberculosis and infections with non-tuberculous 
mycobacteria in human populations, but the mechanisms by which this polymorphism 
affects TLR2 signaling are unclear. In this study, we determined the impact of 
the R753Q TLR2 polymorphism on macrophage sensing of Mycobacterium smegmatis 
Upon infection with M. smegmatis, macrophages from knock-in mice harboring R753Q 
TLR2 expressed lower levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 compared with cells 
from WT mice, but both R753Q TLR2- and WT-derived macrophages exhibited 
comparable bacterial burdens. The decreased cytokine responses in R753Q 
TLR2-expressing macrophages were accompanied by impaired phosphorylation of 
IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1), p38, ERK1/2 MAPKs, and p65 NF-κB, suggesting 
that the R753Q TLR2 polymorphism alters the functions of the myeloid 
differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-IRAK-dependent signaling 
axis. Supporting this notion, HEK293 cells stably transfected with YFP-tagged 
R753Q TLR2 displayed reduced recruitment of MyD88 to TLR2, decreased NF-κB 
activation, and impaired IL-8 expression upon exposure to M. smegmatis 
Collectively, our results indicate that the R753Q polymorphism alters TLR2 
signaling competence, leading to impaired MyD88-TLR2 assembly, reduced 
phosphorylation of IRAK-1, diminished activation of MAPKs and NF-κB, and 
deficient induction of cytokines in macrophages infected with M. smegmatis.","© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M117.784470

the status of PF in SSc. We performed that an exhaustive search of the PubMed 
database was performed to identify eligible studies. Then, a comprehensive 
meta-analysis was performed by comparing PF+-SSc and PF--SSc patients to 
identify genetic polymorphisms associated with the status of PF in SSc. Among 
eight SSc-associated susceptibility polymorphisms which were applied for 
meta-analysis, IRF5 rs2004640 polymorphism (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.22, 
P = 1.39 × 10-2), STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.07-1.47, 
P = 5.3 × 10-3), IRAK1 rs1059702 polymorphism (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.37, 
P = 0.007), and CTGF G-945C polymorphism (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.18-1.71, P = 0.002) 
are associated with PF status in SSc, while TNFAIP3 rs5029939, CD226 rs763361, 
CD247 rs2056626, and IRF5 rs10488631 polymorphisms are not. Since IRF5, STAT4, 
and IRAK1 are important regulatory factors in the control of innate immune 
responses and CTGF is involved in the synthesis of extracellular matrix, these 
results suggest a role of the innate immunity and matrix compounds in the 
pathogenesis of PF in SSc.","DOI: 10.1007/s00296-017-3722-5

cardiac cell survival, whereas another receptor, TLR2, from the same family, is 
detrimental. Here, we examined the interactive role of these two innate 
signaling molecules under stressful conditions, including IL-10 knockout 
(IL-10-/-) mice, global ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rat hearts, and in 
vitro short hairpin RNA experimental models in the presence or absence of IL-10 
(10 ng/ml). Circulating and myocardial levels of TNF-α as well as apoptosis and 
fibrosis were higher in IL-10-/- mice. The increase in TLR2 in IL-10-/- hearts 
indicated its negative regulation by IL-10. Ex vivo I/R also caused a marked 
upregulation of TLR2 and TNF-α as well as apoptotic and fibrotic signals. 
However, a 40-min reperfusion with IL-10 triggered an increase in TLR4 
expression and improved recovery of cardiac function. The increase in IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-M and IRAK-2 activity during I/R injury 
suggested their role in TLR2 signaling. In vitro inhibition of TLR4 activity as 
a consequence of RNA inhibition-mediated suppression of myeloid differentiation 
gene (MyD)88 suggested MyD88-dependent activation of TLR4. The inclusion of 
IL-10 during reperfusion also downregulated the expression of IRAK-2, TNF-α 
receptor-associated factor 1-interacting protein (TRAIP) and apoptotic signals, 
caspase-3, and the Bax-to-Bcl-xL ratio. IL-10 reduced the TNF-α 
receptor-associated increase in TRAIP-induced apoptosis during I/R injury, which 
led to an increase in IL-1β to mitigate transforming growth factor-β receptor 
type I-mediated fibrosis. The IL-10 mitigation of these changes suggests that 
the stimulation through TLR4 signaling promotes IRAK-4 and phosphorylates IRAK-1 
instead of IRAK-2 and may be an important therapeutic approach in restoring 
heart health in stress.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Under stress conditions such as 
downregulation of the IL-10 gene or ischemia-reperfusion injury, Toll-like 
receptor (TLR)4 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 activation is 
suppressed, along with the upregulation of TLR-2 and IRAK-2, resulting in 
fibrosis and apoptosis. It is suggested that IL-10 helps to maintain heart 
function during stress via myeloid differentiation gene

the Lys63-linked ubiquitin (K63-Ub) chains needed to activate the ""master"" 
protein kinase TAK1. Here, we report that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity contributes 
to but is not essential for the IL-1-dependent formation of K63-Ub chains, TAK1 
activation, or IL-8 production in human cells, because Pellino1 and Pellino2 
generate the K63-Ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing E3 
ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants. The IL-1-induced formation of K63-Ub chains and 
ubiquitylation of IRAK1, IRAK4, and MyD88 was abolished in 
TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-knockout (KO) cells, but not in TRAF6 KO or 
Pellino1/2 double-KO cells. The reexpression of E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants 
partially restored IL-1 signaling in TRAF6 KO cells, but not in 
TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-KO cells. Pellino1-generated K63-Ub chains 
activated the TAK1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to TRAF6-generated 
K63-Ub chains. The early phase of TLR signaling and the TLR-dependent secretion 
of IL-10 (controlled by IRAKs 1 and 2) was only reduced modestly in primary 
macrophages from knockin mice expressing the E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6[L74H] 
mutant, but the late-phase production of IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα (controlled only 
by the pseudokinase IRAK2) was abolished. RANKL-induced signaling in macrophages

fruits, and vegetables. Apigenin can attenuate inflammation, which is associated 
with many chronic diseases of aging. Senescent cells-stressed cells that 
accumulate with age in mammals-display a pro-inflammatory senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype (SASP) that can drive or exacerbate several age-related 
pathologies, including cancer. Flavonoids, including apigenin, were recently 
shown to reduce the SASP of a human fibroblast strain induced to senesce by 
bleomycin. Here, we confirm that apigenin suppresses the SASP in three human 
fibroblast strains induced to senesce by ionizing radiation, constitutive MAPK 
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling, oncogenic RAS, or replicative 
exhaustion. Apigenin suppressed the SASP in part by suppressing IL-1α signaling 
through IRAK1 and IRAK4, p38-MAPK, and NF-κB. Apigenin was particularly potent 
at suppressing the expression and secretion of CXCL10 (IP10), a newly identified 
SASP factor. Further, apigenin-mediated suppression of the SASP substantially 
reduced the aggressive phenotype of human breast cancer cells, as determined by 
cell proliferation, extracellular matrix invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition. Our results support the idea that apigenin is a promising natural 
product for reducing the impact of senescent cells on age-related diseases such 
as cancer.","DOI: 10.1007/s11357-017-9970-1

significant worldwide public health problem. While the majority of infections 
are asymptomatic, infection can result in a range of symptoms. MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through 
repression or degradation of mRNAs. To understand the contribution of miRNAs to 
DENV 2 replication, we screened a number of candidate miRNAs for variations in 
expression levels during DENV 2 infection of HepG2 (liver) cells. Seven miRNAs 
were identified as differentially expressed, and one, miR-21, was differentially 
expressed at all time points examined. Interestingly, miR-21 was also 
differentially regulated in DENV 2 infection under conditions of antibody 
dependent enhancement of infection, and in direct Zika virus infection, but not 
in DENV 4 infection. The role of miR-21 during DENV infection was further 
examined by treating HepG2 cells with an anti-miR-21 (AMO-21) before DENV 
infection. The results showed a significant reduction in DENV 2 production, 
clearly suggesting that miR-21 plays a key role in DENV 2 replication. To 
further confirm the role of miR-21 in DENV infection, a peptide nucleic acid-21 
(PNA-21) construct with a nucleotide sequence complementary to AMO-21, was 
co-administered with AMO-21 as an AMO-21/PNA-21 complex followed by DENV 2

PNA-21 significantly increased DENV 2 titer and the combined AMO-21/PNA-21 
showed no difference from non-treated infection controls. Taken together, the

of multiple cancers. However, the clinical significance of IRAK1 in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying molecular mechanism remain 
unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of IRAK1 in the 
pathogenesis of HCC in this study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HCC tissues and para-carcinoma tissues were collected for 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis to evaluate IRAK1 expression. Data of IRAK1 
expression were downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) for analyzing the 
clinical significance of IRAK1. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
and survival analyses were carried out to assess the diagnostic and prognostic 
significance of IRAK1 in IHC and TCGA data. Additionally, we investigated the 
alteration of IRAK1 gene in HCC from cBioPortal to generate a network of the 
interaction between IRAK1 and the neighboring genes. The influence of IRAK1 gene 
alteration on the prognosis of HCC patients was evaluated by survival analysis.
RESULTS: Analysis of both IHC and TCGA data revealed a significant upregulation 
of IRAK1 in HCC tissues. The IHC analysis revealed there was an increasing trend 
in IRAK1 expression among normal liver tissues, liver cirrhosis tissues, 
para-carcinoma tissues and HCC tissues. The ROC curves for IHC and TCGA data 
demonstrated that IRAK1 exhibited a significant diagnostic value for HCC. 
Moreover, IRAK1 expression was observed to be associated with tumor size, 
metastasis and T-stage. The survival analysis indicated that the upregulation of 
IRAK1 predicted a worse overall survival of HCC. Additionally, data from 
cBioPortal confirmed that 29% of HCC tissues possessed an alteration of the 
IRAK1 gene.
CONCLUSION: IRAK1 may act as an oncogene in the development of HCC with its 
overexpression in HCC. Moreover, IRAK1 might serve as a promising diagnostic and 
therapeutic target for HCC.","DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S132120

in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, 
there is a close relationship between TLRs and miRNAs and impairment in 
regulating their expression which can play a vital role in the 
immunopathogenesis of many inflammatory reactions. This research aimed to study 
the pharmaceutical effects of M2000 (β-d-mannuronic acid) on the expression of 
miR-146a and its two target molecules (IRAK1 and TRAF6), and the transcription 
factor NF-κB in the HEK-Blue hTLR2 cell line.
METHODS: The cytotoxicity of M2000 was assessed by the MTT assay, and the 
qRT-PCR technique was employed in the presence and absence of M2000 treatment to 
measure gene-expression levels of miR-146a, IRAK1, TRAF6, and NF-κB.
RESULTS: MTT assay indicated that M2000 (before the concentration of 500μg/ml) 
had no cytotoxic effect on HEK-Blue hTLR2 cells. Our results showed that M2000 
at low and high doses (5 and 25μg/well) could significantly reduce gene

medication at two different doses could considerably decrease IRAK1 and TRAF6 
gene expression (p<0.001). Moreover, this study revealed that expression level 
of NF-κB also significantly declined at these two doses (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study for the first time shows that M2000 as a novel NSAID 
with immunosuppressive properties is able to modify TLR signaling through 
suppressing the adaptor molecules IRAK1 and TRAF6, the transcription factor

with acute watery diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae O1 or enterotoxigenic 
Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection was investigated. Duodenal biopsies were 
obtained from study-participants at the acute (day 2) and convalescent (day 21) 
stages of disease, and from healthy individuals. Levels of miR-146a, miR-155 and 
miR-375 and target gene (IRAK1, TRAF6, CARD10) and 11 cytokine mRNAs were 
determined by qRT-PCR. The cellular source of microRNAs in biopsies was analyzed 
by in situ hybridization. The ability of V. cholerae bacteria and their secreted 
products to cause changes in microRNA- and mRNA levels in polarized tight 
monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells was investigated. miR-146a and miR-155 
were expressed at significantly elevated levels at acute stage of V. cholerae 
infection and declined to normal at convalescent stage (P<0.009 versus controls; 
P = 0.03 versus convalescent stage, pairwise). Both microRNAs were mainly 
expressed in the epithelium. Only marginal down-regulation of target genes IRAK1 
and CARD10 was seen and a weak cytokine-profile was identified in the acute 
infected mucosa. No elevation of microRNA levels was seen in ETEC infection. 
Challenge of tight monolayers with the wild type V. cholerae O1 strain C6706 and 
clinical isolates from two study-participants, caused significant increase in 
miR-155 and miR-146a by the strain C6706 (P<0.01). One clinical isolate caused 
reduction in IRAK1 levels (P<0.05) and none of the strains induced inflammatory 
cytokines. In contrast, secreted factors from these strains caused markedly 
increased levels of IL-8, IL-1β, and CARD10 (P<0.001), without inducing microRNA 
expression. Thus, miR-146a and miR-155 are expressed in the duodenal epithelium 
at the acute stage of cholera. The inducer is probably the V. cholerae 
bacterium. By inducing microRNAs the bacterium can limit the innate immune 
response of the host, including inflammation evoked by its own secreted factors, 
thereby decreasing the risk of being eliminated.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173817

MIM *300005) results in the Rett syndrome, whereas gain-of-function mutations 
are associated with the MECP2 duplication syndrome.
METHODS: We did research on a family with two brothers showing Xq28 duplication 
syndrome using various molecular cytogenetic techniques such as multiplex 
ligation-dependent probe amplification and array-based genomic hybridization.
RESULTS: The duplicated region had several genes including MECP2 and 
interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1; MIM *300283). MECP2 and IRAK1 
were associated with the neurological phenotypes in dose-sensitive and 
dose-critical manner. The brothers demonstrated severe intellectual disability, 
autistic features, generalized hypotonia, recurrent infections, epilepsy, 
choreiform movements such as hand-wringing movement, and moderate increased 
spasticity with the lower limbs. The X-inactivation test showed a complete 
skewed X inactivation pattern of mother. In this reason, the mother had the same 
loci duplication but showed significantly little neurological manifestation 
compared to the two sons.
CONCLUSIONS: MECP2/IRAK1 duplication at Xq28 is inherited as an X-linked 
recessive trait and male-specific disorder associated with severe intellectual 
disability. We tried to analyze the information of the relationship between 
neuropsychiatric phenotype and the extent of duplication at Xq28 by comparing 
with previous reports.","DOI: 10.1186/s12881-017-0394-7

feedback regulator of multiple nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activation 
pathways in retinal endothelial cells (RECs). We hypothesized that miR-146 plays 
an important role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) by inhibiting diabetes-induced 
inflammatory response in the retina. The purpose of the current study is to test 
this hypothesis in vivo.
METHODS: Lentiviruses expressing rno-miR-146a, lenti-miR-146a, and negative 
control oligonucleotide with scrambled sequence, lenti-miR-neg ctl, were 
produced. Young male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with a single dose of 
streptozotocin ([STZ] 65 mg/kg) to induce diabetes. One week after diabetes, 
animals were injected with lentivirus intravitreally (4 μl, ∼106 CFU/mL). Three 
months after diabetes, retinal microvascular leakage was tested by Evans blue 
assay; retinal function by electroretinogram (ERG). Total RNA and protein lysate 
were isolated from the retina for quantitative (q)RT-PCR and Western blot 
analyses.
RESULTS: Lenti-miR-146a robustly transduced human retinal endothelial cells 
(HRECs) and increased the expression of miR-146a in vitro. In vivo, intravitreal 
injection of lenti-miR-146a increased the expression of miR-146a in the retina, 
while its key downstream target genes, including CARD10, IRAK1, and TRAF6, were 
downregulated. Intravitreal delivery of miR-146 inhibited diabetes-induced 
upregulation of NF-κB downstream gene, Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 
(ICAM1), as well as microvascular leakage and retinal functional defects.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal delivery of miR-146 inhibited diabetes-induced NF-κB 
activation and retinal microvascular and neuronal functional defects in a 
diabetic rat model.","DOI: 10.1167/iovs.16-21223

sensing gut microbes and subsequently initiating proper immune responses. During 
the neonatal stage, the intestinal epithelium is under immune repression, 
allowing the transition for newborns from a relatively sterile intra-uterine 
environment to one that is rich in foreign antigens. The mechanism underlying 
such immune repression remains largely unclear, but involves downregulation of 
IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase), an essential component of 
toll-like receptor-mediated NF-κB signaling. We report here that heterogeneous 
nuclear ribonucleoprotein I (hnRNPI), an RNA binding protein, is essential for 
regulating neonatal immune adaptation. We generated a mouse model in which 
hnRNPI is ablated specifically in the intestinal epithelial cells, and 
characterized intestinal defects in the knockout mice. We found that loss of 
hnRNPI function in mouse intestinal epithelial cells results in early onset of 
spontaneous colitis followed by development of invasive colorectal cancer. 
Strikingly, the epithelium-specific hnRNPI knockout neonates contain aberrantly 
high IRAK1 protein levels in the colons and fail to develop immune tolerance to 
environmental microbes. Our results demonstrate that hnRNPI plays a critical 
role in establishing neonatal immune adaptation and preventing colitis and 
colorectal cancer.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006672

Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Commonly recurring mutations include MYD88 
(95% to 97%), CXCR4 (30% to 40%), ARID1A (17%), and CD79B (8% to 15%). 
Diagnostic discrimination of WM from overlapping B-cell malignancies is aided by 
MYD88 mutation status. Transcription is affected by MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations 
and includes overexpression of genes involved in VDJ recombination, CXCR4 
pathway signaling, and BCL2 family members. Among patients with MYD88 mutations, 
those with CXCR4 mutations show transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressors 
associated with acquisition of mutated MYD88. Deletions involving chromosome 6q 
are common and include genes that modulate nuclear factor-κB, BCL2, BTK, 
apoptosis, differentiation, and ARID1B. Non-chromosome 6q genes are also 
frequently deleted and include LYN, a regulator of B-cell receptor signaling. 
MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations affect WM disease presentation and treatment outcome. 
Patients with wild-type MYD88 show lower bone marrow disease burden and serum 
immunoglobulin M levels but show an increased risk of death. Patients with CXCR4 
mutations have higher bone marrow disease burden, and those with nonsense CXCR4 
mutations have higher serum immunoglobulin M levels and incidence of symptomatic 
hyperviscosity. Mutated MYD88 triggers BTK, IRAK1/IRAK4, and HCK growth and 
survival signaling, whereas CXCR4 mutations promote AKT and extracellular 
regulated kinase-1/2 signaling and drug resistance in the presence of its ligand 
CXCL12. Ibrutinib is active in patients with WM and is affected by MYD88 and 
CXCR4 mutation status. Patients with mutated MYD88 and wild-type CXCR4 mutation 
status exhibit best responses to ibrutinib. Lower response rates and delayed 
responses to ibrutinib are associated with mutated CXCR4 in patients with WM. 
MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation status may be helpful in treatment selection for 
symptomatic patients. Novel therapeutic approaches under investigation include 
therapeutics targeting MYD88, CXCR4, and BCL2 signaling.","DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2016.71.0814

sepsis. IVIg also affects monocyte differentiation and functions, two processes 
in which microRNAs play a crucial role. Monocytes detect microorganisms through 
pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLR4. MiR-146a has been shown to 
supress NF-κB and IRF3 activity, two key components of TLR4 signaling. To 
evaluate whether miR-146a is involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of IVIg, 
monocytes were treated with LPS or IVIg alone or, alternately, first activated 
with LPS followed by washing and addition of IVIg. MiR-146a, IRF3, TNF-α, IL-1β, 
IL-6, IL-10, IFN-β, TGF-β1 and IL-1Ra expression was analyzed by qPCR, while 
IRAK1, TRAF6 and IκBα expression was measured by Western blotting. We found that 
addition of IVIg to LPS-activated monocytes significantly upregulated the 
expression of miR-146a, which was associated with a significant reduction in the 
expression of its targets IRF3 and its regulated gene IFN-β. Furthermore, 
expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, and consequently NF-κB activation, was also reduced 
in LPS-activated monocytes following addition of IVIg, whereas TGF-β1, IL-10 and 
IL-1Ra were increased. Our results thus suggest that miR-146a is a mediator of 
IVIg effects in inflammatory disorders, point to an important role for miR-146a

inflammatory factors in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) induced by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its underlying mechanism.
METHODS: hPDLCs were cultured by tissue cultivation in vitro and treated with 
various concentrations of LPS for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. hPDLCs were treated with 
miR-142-3p mimics for 24 h in the presence of 2.0 μg/mL LPS and the expression 
levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) were detected by ELISA 
assay. The target relationship between miR-142-3p and interleukin-1 receptor- 
associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The 
miR-142-3p and IRAK1 mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR. The protein 
expression levels of IRAK1, TLR4 and NF-κB were detected by Western blotting. 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 software package.
RESULTS: The miR-142-3p expression level was decreased significantly at 24 h in 
2.0 μg/mL LPS-treated hPDLCs (P<0.01). Transfection of miR-142-3p mimics 
remarkably increased miR-142-3p expression (P<0.01). The secretion of 
inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) in LPS-treated hPDLCs was 
significantly decreased by miR-142-3p overexpression (P<0.05). Dual-luciferase 
reporter assay showed a directly targeting relationship between miR-142-3p and 
IRAK1. Overexpression of miR-142-3p significantly reduced the IRAK1 protein 
expression in LPS-treated hPDLCs (P<0.05), whereas no obvious effect on IRAK1 
mRNA expression was noted (P>0.05). Moreover, miR-142-3p overexpression markedly 
diminished the protein expression of TLR4 and phosphorylated NF-κB in 
LPS-treated hPDLCs (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of miR-142-3p can alleviate the inflammatory 
response induced by LPS in hPDLCs and the underlying mechanism may be associated

expression of TLR2 in patients, which is suggested to induce invasive pulmonary 
aspergillosis (IPA). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles 
in the pathogenesis of human respiratory system disorders. Therefore, the aim of 
this study was to identify the miRNAs involved in the regulation of TLR2 
signaling in COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: miRNA microarray analysis was performed to screen for the 
dysregulated miRNAs in alveolar macrophages (AMs) isolated from COPD rats. The 
interaction between these miRNAs and TLR2 gene was predicted using miRBase and 
validated using dual luciferase assay. Based on the analysis, a novel 
miR-344b-1-3p was identified as a novel modulator of TLR2 gene. Then, the 
mechanism through which miR-344b-1-3p regulated TLR2 expression was explored 
using cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-pretreated NR8383 cells. Moreover, by 
subjecting CSE-pretreated NR8383 cells to Pam3CSK4, the effect of miR-344b-1-3p 
on NF-κB activity and other important mediators of COPD, including IRAK-1, ERK, 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and MIP-2, was also assessed.
RESULTS: COPD rat model was successfully induced by smoke inhalation. Among the 
11 upregulated miRNAs in AMs from COPD rats, miR-344b-1-3p was predicted to be a 
novel miRNA targeting TLR2 gene. In the CSE pretreated NR8383 cells exposed to 
Pam3CSK4, miR-344b-1-3p inhibition increased the expression levels of TLR2, 
TNF-α, and IL-1β and decreased the expression levels of MIP-2. In addition, the 
phosphorylation of IRAK-1, IκBα, and IRK was augmented by miR-344b-1-3p 
inhibition.
CONCLUSION: Findings outlined in this study suggest that miR-344b-1-3p was an 
effective modulator of TLR2 gene, which can be employed as a promising 
therapeutic and preventive target of IPA in COPD patients.","DOI: 10.2147/COPD.S120415

reduced. Additionally, hippocampal damage was alleviated. While the relative 
miR-146a levels significantly increased, the expression of its target mRNAs 
(IRAK-1 and TRAF-6) and typical inflammatory modulators (NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β, 
and IL-6) decreased, supporting an anti-inflammatory role of miR-146a via the 
TLR pathway. This study is the first to demonstrate that intranasal delivery of 
miR-146a mimics can improve seizure onset and hippocampal damage in the acute 
phase of lithium-pilocarpine-induced seizures, which provides inflammation-based 
clues for the development of novel TLE treatments.","DOI: 10.1155/2017/6512620

of the central nervous system (CNS), leads to demyelination and functional 
deficits. Currently, there is lack of effective remyelination therapies for 
patients with demyelinating diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate OL function. We 
hypothesized that miR-146a, by inactivating interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1), promotes differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells 
(OPCs) and thereby enhances remyelination. To test this hypothesis, a 
demyelination model induced by a cuprizone (CPZ) diet was employed, in which 
C57BL/6J mice were fed with a CPZ diet for 5weeks. After termination of CPZ 
diet, the mice were randomly treated with continuous infusion of miR-146a mimics 
or mimic controls into the corpus callosum for 7days. Compared to the mimic 
control, infusion of miR-146a mimics facilitated remyelination assessed by 
increased myelin basic proteins in the corpus callosum, which was associated 
with augmentation of newly generated mature OLs. Infusion of miR-146a mimics 
also substantially elevated miR-146a levels in the corpus callosum and 
fluorescently tagged miR-146a mimics were mainly detected in OPCs. Western blot 
and double immmunofluorescent staining analysis showed that the miR-146a 
treatment considerably reduced IRAK1 protein levels and the number of 
IRAK1-positive cells, respectively. Collectively, these data indicate that 
exogenous miR-146a enhances remyelination, possibly by promoting OPCs to 
differentiate into myelinated OLs via targeting IRAK1.",Copyright © 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.02.029

phosphorylation patterns of signaling proteins, activator protein (AP)-1, and 
nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways were all affected by TQ treatment. Finally, we 
used additional kinase and luciferase validation assays with interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) to show that IRAK1 is directly suppressed

(D-GalN) administration. In other in vitro experiment, RAW264.7 macrophages were 
pretreated with GA before LPS exposure. The mortality, hepatic tissue histology,

and bacterial LPS. LPS binds Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, which leads to the 
release of proinflammatory cytokines that are essential for a potent innate 
immune response against pathogens. The innate immune system is tightly 
regulated, as excessive inflammation can lead to organ failure and death. 
MicroRNAs have recently emerged as important regulators of the innate immune 
system. Here we determined the function of miR-718, which is conserved across 
mammals and overlaps with the 5' UTR of the interleukin 1 receptor-associated 
kinase (IRAK1) gene. As IRAK1 is a key component of innate immune signaling 
pathways that are downstream of most TLRs, we hypothesized that miR-718 helps 
regulate the innate immune response. Activation of TLR4, but not TLR3, induced 
the expression of miR-718 in macrophages. miR-718 expression was also induced in 
the spleens of mice upon LPS injection. miR-718 modulates PI3K/Akt signaling by 
directly down-regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), thereby 
promoting phosphorylation of Akt, which leads to a decrease in proinflammatory 
cytokine production. Phosphorylated Akt induces let-7e expression, which, in 
turn, down-regulates TLR4 and further diminishes TLR4-mediated proinflammatory 
signals. Decreased miR-718 expression is associated with bacterial burden during 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection and alters the infection dynamics of N. 
gonorrhoeae in vitro Furthermore, miR-718 regulates the induction of LPS 
tolerance in macrophages. We propose a role for miR-718 in controlling TLR4 
signaling and inflammatory cytokine signaling through a negative feedback 
regulation loop involving down-regulation of TLR4, IRAK1, and NF-κB.","© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M116.749325

array of proinflammatory cytokines through the nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway. 
Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Toll-like receptors contain a common 
cytoplasmic motif the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) homology domain. This motif is required 
for NF-κB activation. IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a key adapter 
molecule recruited during the signaling cascade of the TIR. Its gene expression 
is regulated by the micro-RNA (miR)-146a.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of IRAK1 single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) rs3027898 (IRAK1 rs3027898) and miR-146a SNP rs2910164 (miR-146a 
rs2910164) in Tunisian patients with RA and their association with C reactive 
protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), anticyclic citrullinated peptide 
(anti-CCP) antibodies, and erosion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort of 172 adult RA patients and 224 matched 
controls, IRAK1 rs3027898 genotyping was determined by mutagenically separated 
polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) with newly designed primers, and miR-146a 
rs2910164 genotyping was determined by fragment length polymorphism 
PCR-restriction (RFLP-PCR).
RESULTS: The IRAK1 rs3027898 A allele was detected in 67% of RA patients and 70% 
of controls indicating that it is not associated with RA in codominant, 
dominant, or recessive models even after stratification by age and gender. The 
miR-146a rs2910164 G allele was detected in 76% of RA patients and 68% of 
controls, thus the C allele confers some protection based on a dominant model 
[CC+GC (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.6 (0.3-0.9), p = 0.03)]. No 
association with CRP, RF, anti-CCP, or erosion was found for either SNPs.
CONCLUSION: The IRAK1 rs3027898 was not associated with RA, whereas C allele of 
miR-146a rs2910164 was found to be protective. Functional studies are required 
to investigate the exact role of miR-146a rs2910164 during RA.","DOI: 10.1089/gtmb.2016.0270

inflammation, antimicrobial and killing mechanism associated genes, immune 
mediators, adhesion, and pathogen recognition. The results indicated that

permissive cells for respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (IAV) and 
respiratory syncytial virus. Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs 
(miRNAs) are involved in virus-host relationship, and this led us to investigate 
its essential roles in the in vitro hNECs model derived from multiple donors. By 
comparing the differential expression of miRNAs upon IAV infection among animal 
and cell line studies, candidates were selected with focus on the initial immune 
response. After infection of influenza H3N2 virus, hNECs showed constant 
increase virus titer at 24-72h post-infection (hpi); accompanied with a 
significantly elevated level of miR-146a-5p at 72 hpi. The exponential elevation 
of progeny virus titer correlated with a key influenza sensing Toll-like 
receptor (TLR)7 pathway. TLR7 downstream gene transcripts, myeloid 
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), interferon regulator factor 7 
(IRF7), and interferon-β (IFN-β) were significantly upregulated at 48 and 72 
hpi, while interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor 
associated factor-6 (TRAF6) were unchanged. Interestingly, when miR-146a was 
overexpressed with miRNA mimics prior to H3N2 infection, further decreased 
transcripts of TRAF6, but not IRAK1, were detected. By using the in vitro hNEC 
model, we demonstrated that H3N2-induced miR-146a specifically targets and 
regulates TRAF6 expression; but not IRAK expression in the nasal epithelium. We 
also found that unlike the cell model studies that lead to our studies, when ran 
across a heterogeneous model of different individual, miRNA signals were highly 
varied and the expression of most miRNAs, including miR-146a-5p, was more 
subdued compared to homogenous cell line model, highlighting a need for a more

(1)From the Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, 
Japan.","OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-36 (IL-36) is a recently described proinflammatory 
cytokine, characterized by the induction of inflammatory mediators. In the 
present study, we investigated the biological activity and the signal 
transduction of IL-36α in human pancreatic myofibroblasts.
METHODS: The mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators was evaluated 
using real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
respectively. The expression of IL-36α and its receptor in the pancreatic tissue 
was evaluated using immunohistochemical technique. Intracellular signaling 
pathways were evaluated using immunoblotting and specific small interference 
RNA-transfected cells.
RESULTS: Interleukin-36α and its receptor complex IL-36R/IL-1RAcP were detected 
in fibrotic tissue of chronic pancreatitis. Interleukin-36α dose- and 
time-dependently induced the mRNA expression and protein secretion of CXCL1, 
CXCL8, MMP-1, and MMP-3 from human pancreatic myofibroblasts. Interleukin-36α 
assembled MyD88 adaptor proteins (MyD88, TRAF6, IRAK1, and TAK1) into a complex. 
Furthermore, IL-36α induced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein 
kinases and the activation of nuclear factor κB and activator protein 1. 
Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors and small interference RNAs specific 
for nuclear factor κB and activator protein 1 significantly suppressed the 
protein secretion of inflammatory mediators induced by IL-36α stimulation.

has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory ability. However, the 
hepatoprotective effects and molecular mechanisms of CGA on concanavalin A (Con 
A)-induced hepatitis have not been explored. In the present study, we found that 
pretreatment with CGA dose-dependently inhibited the elevation of plasma 
aminotransferases and alleviated hepatic pathological damage as well as 
hepatocyte apoptosis in Con A-exposed mice. Additionally, CGA markedly 
suppressed the production of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon 
(IFN)-γ, alleviated the infiltration of hepatic macrophages, neutrophils, and 
activated CD4+ T lymphocytes in Con A-primed mice. Moreover, CGA downregulated 
Con A-induced hepatic expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and 
ELAM-1) mRNA and protein, and inhibited Con A-activated Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
4 signal molecules including TLR4, p-IRAK1, p-IκB, and p-p38. Finally, our 
results also showed that CGA exhibited a therapeutic effect, which CGA 
posttreatment improved hepatic damage at 1, 3, and 6h after Con A. Taken 
together, these data suggested that CGA could effectively prevent mice from Con 
A-induced hepatitis, which might be through suppressing the activation of TLR4 
signaling, downregulating the expression of adhesion molecules, and alleviating 
the infiltration and activation of hepatic leukocytes and the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines.",Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2017.01.017

extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing microRNAs. However, no data are 
available on whether human CD4+ T cell subsets release EVs containing different 
pattern of microRNAs. The present work aimed at filling this gap by assessing 
the microRNA content in EVs released upon in vitro T cell receptor stimulation 
of Th1, Th17, and T regulatory (Treg) cells. Our results indicate that EVs 
released by Treg cells are significantly different compared with those released 
by the other subsets. In particular, miR-146a-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-21-5p are 
enriched, whereas miR-106a-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-19a-3p are depleted in 
Treg-derived EVs. The in vitro identified EV-associated microRNA signature was 
increased in serum of autoimmune patients with psoriasis and returned to healthy 
levels upon effective treatment with etanercept, a biological drug targeting the 
TNF pathway and suppressing inflammation. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
showed an over-representation of genes relevant for T cell activation, such as 
CD40L, IRAK1, IRAK2, STAT1, and c-Myb in the list of validated targets of 
Treg-derived EV miRNAs. At functional level, Treg-derived (but not 
Th1/Th17-derived) EVs inhibited CD4+ T cell proliferation and suppressed two 
relevant targets of miR-146a-5p: STAT1 and IRAK2. In conclusion, our work 
identified the miRNAs specifically released by different human CD4+ T cell 
subsets and started to unveil the potential use of their quantity in human serum 
to mark the pathological elicitation of these cells in vivo and their biological 
effect in cell to cell communication during the adaptive immune response.","© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M116.769893

families transduce signals via a canonical pathway involving the MyD88 adapter 
and the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) complex. This complex 
contains four molecules, including at least two (IRAK-1 and IRAK-4) active 
kinases. In mice and humans, deficiencies of IRAK-4 or MyD88 abolish most TLR 
(except for TLR3 and some TLR4) and IL-1R signaling in both leukocytes and 
fibroblasts. TLR and IL-1R responses are weak but not abolished in mice lacking 
IRAK-1, whereas the role of IRAK-1 in humans remains unclear. We describe here a 
boy with X-linked MECP2 deficiency-related syndrome due to a large de novo Xq28 
chromosomal deletion encompassing both MECP2 and IRAK1 Like many boys with MECP2 
null mutations, this child died very early, at the age of 7 mo. Unlike most 
IRAK-4- or MyD88-deficient patients, he did not suffer from invasive bacterial 
diseases during his short life. The IRAK-1 protein was completely absent from 
the patient's fibroblasts, which responded very poorly to all TLR2/6 (PAM2CSK4, 
LTA, FSL-1), TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4), and TLR4 (LPS, MPLA) agonists tested but had 
almost unimpaired responses to IL-1β. By contrast, the patient's peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells responded normally to all TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4, TLR7, 
and TLR8 (R848) agonists tested, and to IL-1β. The death of this child precluded 
long-term evaluations of the clinical consequences of inherited IRAK-1 
deficiency. However, these findings suggest that human IRAK-1 is essential 
downstream from TLRs but not IL-1Rs in fibroblasts, whereas it plays a redundant 
role downstream from both TLRs and IL-1Rs in leukocytes.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1620139114

complications such as neurological disorders. Previous reports have indicated 
the memory-improving effect of troxerutin, in rat hippocampus, but the 
underlying mechanisms are unclear. Hence, we have investigated the effect of 
troxerutin pretreatment on gene expressions of inflammation-related microRNAs 
(miRs), miR-146a and miR-155, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling 
pathway in the hippocampus of healthy and diabetic rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups 
(control, control + troxerutin, diabetic, and diabetic + troxerutin). Diabetes 
was induced by a single i.p. injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). Troxerutin 
(150 mg/kg) was orally administered in animals for 1 month. After 10 weeks of 
diabetes, animals were anesthetized and decapitated for the isolation of 
hippocampus. The expression of miR-146a and miR-155 and the messenger RNA (mRNA) 
expressions of NF-κB, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), and 
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6) were analyzed by 
real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Diabetes significantly increased hippocampal mRNA levels of NF-κB, 
IRAK-1, and TRAF-6 compared with nondiabetic rats (P < 0.05); however, 
pretreatment with troxerutin decreased them in both diabetic and nondiabetic 
animals, independent of its glycemic effect (P < 0.05). The expression levels of 
miR-146a and miR-155 were decreased in diabetic group as compared to the control 
(P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: These findings showed that troxerutin could inhibit the inflammatory 
NF-κB pathway in the hippocampus of diabetic rats, which may be due to the 
negative feedback loop regulated by miR-146a.","DOI: 10.4103/0253-7613.194847

    Sci Transl Med. 2017 Jan 25;9(374):","Chromosomal translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with various 
partner genes result in aggressive leukemia with dismal outcomes. Despite 
similar expression at the mRNA level from the wild-type and chimeric MLL 
alleles, the chimeric protein is more stable. We report that UBE2O functions in 
regulating the stability of wild-type MLL in response to interleukin-1 
signaling. Targeting wild-type MLL degradation impedes MLL leukemia cell 
proliferation, and it downregulates a specific group of target genes of the MLL 
chimeras and their oncogenic cofactor, the super elongation complex. 
Pharmacologically inhibiting this pathway substantially delays progression, and 
it improves survival of murine leukemia through stabilizing wild-type MLL 
protein, which displaces the MLL chimera from some of its target genes and, 
therefore, relieves the cellular oncogenic addiction to MLL chimeras. 
Stabilization of MLL provides us with a paradigm in the development of therapies 
for aggressive MLL leukemia and perhaps for other cancers caused by

with females. Immune genes which exhibit higher expression in umbilical cord 
blood (UCB) of females may contribute to the female immune advantage during 
infection and inflammation. The aim of this study was to quantify expression of 
Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling genes encoded on the X-chromosome in UCB 
from term female vs. male neonates.
METHODS: UCB samples were collected from term neonates (n = 26) born by elective 
Caesarean section and whole blood was collected from adults (n = 20). Leukocyte 
RNA was isolated and used in quantitative PCR reactions for IκB kinase γ (IKKγ), 
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK)1. 
IRAK1 protein was analyzed by Western blot and confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: In neonates there was no significant difference in the relative 
expression of IKKγ or BTK mRNA between genders. IRAK1 gene and protein 
expression was significantly higher in female vs. male UCB, with increased 
cytosolic IRAK1 expression also evident in female UCB mononuclear cells. Adults 
had higher expression of all three genes compared with neonates.
CONCLUSION: Increased expression of IRAK1 could be responsible, in part, for 
sex-specific responses to infection and subsequent immune advantage in female 
neonates.","DOI: 10.1038/pr.2017.2

homolog (FpIRAK-1) was cloned from the red tail shrimp Fenneropenaeus

specificity for JAK2, FLT3, IRAK1, and CFS1R. This multicenter phase 1/2 study 
evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and clinical activity of 
pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and other advanced myeloid 
malignancies.
METHODS: In the phase 1 dose-escalation part of the study, 43 adults with 
advanced myeloid malignancies received pacritinib 100 to 600 mg once daily (QD). 
In the phase 2 part of the study, 31 adults with refractory or intermediate- or 
high-risk newly diagnosed MF and any degree of cytopenia received pacritinib 
400 mg QD. The primary endpoint is a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume at week 24 
as determined by magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Five patients (11.6%) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity during cycle 
1 of phase 1. The clinical benefit rate was 86.0% (13 patients achieving 
clinical improvement and 24 patients having stable disease). The MTD was 
established at 500 mg QD, and the recommended phase 2 dose was 400 mg QD. In 
phase 2, the primary endpoint was achieved by 23.5% of evaluable patients 
(4/17), with 47.4% (9/19) achieving a ≥50% spleen length reduction at week 24 as 
measured by physical examination. At week 24, 38.9% of evaluable patients (7/18) 
achieved a ≥50% decrease in MF Quality of Life and Symptom Assessment total 
score. Gastrointestinal toxicities were the most common adverse events and were 
predominantly grade 1/2 in severity. Grade 3/4 anemia was reported in 5/31 
patients and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 3/31 patients. The most 
frequent AEs considered to be treatment related were diarrhea (28/31), nausea 
(15/31), vomiting (9/31), and fatigue (4/31). Grade 3 treatment-related AEs were 
reported in seven patients (22.6%), four of whom had diarrhea. No grade 4/5 
treatment-related AEs were reported. No leukopenia, neutropenia, or lymphopenia 
were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Pacritinib was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity in 
MF. The study suggests that pacritinib has unique characteristics, namely a lack 
of substantial myelosuppression and manageable side effects, making it an 
attractive target for further evaluation in MF.

factors leading to the development of related diseases such as insulin 
resistance and liver steatosis. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified as 
important regulators of WAT functions. Herein, we cultured human 
Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes with macrophage-conditioned 
medium (MacCM) and performed an Affimetrix miRNA array to identify miRNAs 
differentially expressed under inflammatory conditions. We identified 24 miRNAs 
differentially expressed upon inflammation in human adipocytes and miR-146a was 
the most up-regulated miRNA species. In subcutaneous WAT, miR-146a was elevated 
in both human and murine obesity. Transfection of miR-146a mimics prevented the 
MacCM-induced inflammatory response in SGBS adipocytes as seen by reduced levels 
of IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA and protein. We identified IRAK1 and TRAF6 as targets of 
miR-146a in human adipocytes and detected a reduced inflammation-induced 
activation of JNK and p38 upon miR-146a transfection. Taken together, we could 
show that miR-146a reduces the inflammatory response in human adipocytes. In a 
negative feedback loop miR-146a might contribute to the regulation of 
inflammatory processes in WAT and possibly prevent an overwhelming inflammatory 
response.","DOI: 10.1038/srep38339

cuspidatum Sieb, a widely used traditional Chinese remedies, possesses 
anti-inflammatory activity in several experimental models. In this study, we 
investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of PD on Staphylococcus 
aureus-induced mastitis in mice and elucidated the potential mechanisms. In mice 
with S aureus-induced mastitis, administration of PD (15, 30, 45 mg/kg, ip) or 
dexamethasone (Dex, 5 mg/kg, ip) significantly suppressed the infiltration of 
inflammatory cells, ameliorated the mammary structural damage, and inhibited the 
activity of myeloperoxidase, a biomarker of neutrophils accumulation. 
Furthermore, PD treatment dose-dependently decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, 
IL-6 and IL-8 in the mammary gland tissues. PD treatment also dose-dependently 
decreased the expression of TLR2, MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4 and TRAF6 as well as the 
phosphorylation of TAK1, MKK3/6, p38 MAPK, IκB-α and NF-κB in the mammary gland 
tissues. In mouse mammary epithelial cells (mMECs) infected by S aureus in 
vitro, pretreatment with PD dose-dependently suppressed the upregulated 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling proteins, and the nuclear translocation 
of NF-κB p65 and AP-1. A TLR2-neutralizing antibody mimicked PD in its 
suppression on S aureus-induced upregulation of MyD88, p-p38 and p-p65 levels in 
mMECs. PD (50, 100 μg/mL) affected neither the growth of S aureus in vitro, nor 
the viability of mMECs. In conclusion, PD does not exhibit antibacterial 
activity against S aureus, its therapeutic effects in mouse S aureus-induced

Previous studies have indicated that dysregulating the miRNAs leads to the 
immunosuppression of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 
(PRRSV). However, it is not clear how PRRSV regulates the expression of host 
miRNA, which may lead to immune escape or promote the replication of the virus. 
The present work suggests that PRRSV upregulated the expression of miR-373 
through elevating the expression of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) in MARC-145 
cells. Furthermore, this work demonstrated that miR-373 promoted the replication 
of PRRSV, since miR-373 was a novel negative miRNA for the production of beta 
interferon (IFN-β) by targeting nuclear factor IA (NFIA), NFIB, interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), IRAK4, and interferon regulatory factor 1 
(IRF1). We also found that both NFIA and NFIB were novel proteins for inducing 
the production of IFN-β, and both of them could inhibit the replication of 
PRRSV. In conclusion, PRRSV upregulated the expression of miR-373 by elevating 
the expression of Sp1 and hijacked the host miR-373 to promote the replication 
of PRRSV by negatively regulating the production of IFN-β.
IMPORTANCE: PRRSV causes one of the most economically devastating diseases of 
swine, and there is no effective method for controlling PRRSV. It is not clear 
how PRRSV inhibits the host's immune response and induces persistent infection. 
Previous studies have shown that PRRSV inhibited the production of type I IFN, 
and the treatment of type I IFN could efficiently inhibit the replication of 
PRRSV, so it will be helpful to design new methods of controlling PRRSV by 
understanding the molecular mechanism by which PRRSV modulated the production of 
IFN. The current work shows that miR-373, upregulated by PRRSV, promotes PRRSV 
replication, since miR-373 impaired the production of IFN-β by targeting NFIA, 
NFIB, IRAK1, IRAK4, and IRF1, and both NFIA and NFIB were antiviral proteins to 
PRRSV. In conclusion, this paper revealed a novel mechanism of PRRSV that 
impaired the production of type I IFN by upregulating miR-373 expression in

costimulatory surface molecules, the release of inflammatory cytokines, and the 
proliferation of T cells during the activation process of DCs, were determined. 
RNAi was used to silence IRAK‑1 gene expression in DCs, followed by 
lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Flow cytometry was then used to detect the 
expression levels of DC surface molecules, including cluster of differentiation 
(CD)86, major histocompatibility complex class II and CD40. Quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction was conducted to detect the mRNA expression levels of 
Toll‑like receptor 4, IRAK‑4, IRAK‑1 and nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) in DCs. In 
addition, ELISA was used to detect the release of the following inflammatory 
cytokines: Interleukin (IL)‑10, IL‑12 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The 
MTS assay was used to determine the effects of IRAK‑1 RNAi on T‑cell 
proliferation. Knockdown of IRAK‑1 gene expression in DCs significantly reduced 
the expression levels of costimulatory surface molecules and intracellular

increased release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL‑10, and significantly 
reduced the proliferation of T cells. These results suggested that suppression

the death domain (DD) adaptor protein MyD88 into an oligomeric post receptor 
complex termed the Myddosome. The Myddosome is a hub for inflammatory and 
oncogenic signaling and has a hierarchical arrangement with 6-8 MyD88 molecules 
assembling with exactly 4 of IRAK-4 and 4 of IRAK-2. Here we show that a 
conserved motif in IRAK-4 (Ser8-X-X-X-Arg12) is autophosphorylated and that the 
phosphorylated DD is unable to form Myddosomes. Furthermore a mutant DD with the 
phospho-mimetic residue Asp at this position is impaired in both signalling and 
Myddosome assembly. IRAK-4 Arg12 is also essential for Myddosome assembly and 
signalling and we propose that phosphorylated Ser8 induces the N-terminal loop 
to fold into an α-helix. This conformer is stabilised by an electrostatic 
interaction between phospho-Ser8 and Arg12 and would destabilise a critical 
interface between IRAK-4 and MyD88. Interestingly IRAK-2 does not conserve this 
motif and has an alternative interface in the Myddosome that requires Arg67, a

(PTC) and is associated with extrathyroidal invasion, advanced tumor stage, and 
poor prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism of miR-146b in relation to its 
oncogenic behavior in PTC and its putative targets remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to investigate IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1) as the potential miR-146b target gene and its involvement in PTC.
DESIGN: We used genome-wide microarray, computational analysis, and 3' UTR 
reporter gene assays to identify IRAK1 as a miR-146b target gene. In vitro 
gain/loss-of-function experiments were further performed to determine the 
effects of IRAK1 on proliferation, colony formation, and wound-healing in PTC 
cancer cell lines. Expression levels of miR-146b and IRAK1 of 50 cases of PTC 
and its adjacent normal thyroid specimens were assessed via qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: Microarray expression profile revealed that the mRNA level of IRAK1 
gene was down-regulated by miR-146b. The 3' UTR of IRAK1 mRNA was found to be a 
molecular target of miR-146b posttranscriptional repression in BCPAP cells by 
reporter gene assays. MiR-146b promoted the migration and proliferation of PTC 
cells by down-regulating IRAK1 expression, whereas restoration of IRAK1 
expression reversed this effect. In addition, the expression of IRAK1 mRNA was 
significantly lower in PTC clinical tissue samples than normal adjacent thyroid 
specimens and showed a strong inverse correlation with the expression of 
miR-146b in PTC specimens.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that IRAK1 is a direct target of miR-146b 
and has functional roles to inhibit various aggressive PTC cell activities. In 
conjunction with current therapeutic regimens, targeting the miR-146b-IRAK1 axis 
may provide a potential approach for PTC management.","DOI: 10.1210/jc.2016-2276

two sets of such neighboring motifs (Ser131/Ser144 and Ser163/Ser173),

phosphorylated peptides showed that individual motifs displayed weak affinities

aggressive behavior and poor outcome of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). 
However, clinically effective and safe NF-κB inhibitors are not yet available. 
Because NF-κB transcription factors can be activated by the interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) downstream of the Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs), but has not been explored in PDAC, we sought to investigate the role of 
IRAKs in the pathobiology of PDAC.Experimental Design: We examined the 
phosphorylation status of IRAK4 (p-IRAK4), the master regulator of TLR 
signaling, in PDAC cell lines, in surgical samples and commercial tissue 
microarray. We then performed functional studies using small-molecule IRAK1/4 
inhibitor, RNA-interference, and CRISPR/Cas9n techniques to delineate the role 
of IRAK4 in NF-κB activity, chemoresistance, cytokine production, and growth of 
PDAC cells in vitro and in vivoResults: p-IRAK4 staining was detectable in the 
majority of PDAC lines and about 60% of human PDAC samples. The presence of 
p-IRAK4 strongly correlated with phospho-NF-κB/p65 staining in PDAC samples and 
is predictive of postoperative relapse and poor overall survival. Inhibition of 
IRAK4 potently reduced NF-κB activity, anchorage-independent growth, 
chemoresistance, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from PDAC cells. 
Both pharmacologic suppression and genetic ablation of IRAK4 greatly abolished 
PDAC growth in mice and augmented the therapeutic effect of gemcitabine by 
promoting apoptosis, reducing tumor cell proliferation and tumor

systemic immune suppression and is dependent on TLR4/MyD88 signalling, but the 
apoptotic signalling pathways have not been defined. Macrophages pretreated with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were unresponsive to subsequent LPS treatment, however, 
but were susceptible to UVR-induced apoptosis. Macrophage survival and apoptotic 
events after UVR were also unaffected by treatment with TLR4 antagonists, a 
blocking IgG or a TLR4 analog antagonist, suggesting that UVR cell death is 
independent of a soluble ligand. After UVR, IRAK4KDKI (catalytically inactive 
IRAK4) and wild-type (WT) macrophages show equivalent levels of survival, as 
measured by MTT assay, and apoptosis, as measured by cleaved caspase-3. 
Furthermore, in macrophages from both mice, UVR activated caspase-8 and PARP, 
while inactivating Rip3. This finding is supported by a lack of IRAK1 
degradation after UVR, compared to treatment with TLR2 or TLR4 agonists. UVR 
induced association of MyD88 with FADD, an extrinsic apoptotic pathway protein, 
but not IRAK4. UVR-induced migration of FADD to the cell membrane of WT 
macrophages, but not MyD88-/- macrophages, was observed (confocal microscopy). 
Co-immunoprecipitation using an epitope-tagged MyD88 revealed that FADD, but not 
TRADD, was recruited to MyD88 within 30 minutes of UVR exposure. UVR engages 
TLR4/MyD88 as a death signalling complex, rather than the classical inflammatory 
signalling pathway triggered by PAMP recognition of TLR4. These studies provide 
the rationale for the future development of topical TLR4 modulating therapies to 
interfere with this UVB-mediated apoptosis and the associated negative 
consequences of immune suppression.",© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/exd.13222

the IKK would likely provide therapeutic benefit for NF-κB-mediated inflammatory 
disease. We previously identified brazilin as a selective upstream IKK inhibitor 
targeting the Myddosome complex. In this study, using a cell-based 
ubiquitination assay for IRAK1 and a chemical library comprising a series of 
structural analogues of brazilin, a novel small molecule, 
2-hydroxy-5,6-dihydroisoindolo[1,2-a]isoquinoline-3,8-dione (IinQ), was 
identified as a selective and potent inhibitor of IRAK1-dependent NF-κB 
activation upon TLR4 ligation. In RAW264.7 macrophages, IinQ drastically 
suppressed activation of upstream IKK signaling events including membrane-bound 
IRAK1 ubiquitination and IKK phosphorylation by the TLR4 ligand, resulting in 
reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators including IL-6, TNF-α, and 
nitric oxide. Interestingly, IinQ did not suppress NF-κB activation via the TLR3 
ligand, DNA damaging agents, or a protein kinase C activator, indicating IinQ is 
specific for TLR4 signaling. Analysis of upstream signaling events further 
confirmed that IinQ disrupts the MyD88-IRAK1-TRAF6 complex formation induced by 
LPS treatment, without affecting TLR4 oligomerization. Moreover, intravenous 
administration of IinQ significantly reduced lethality and attenuated systemic 
inflammatory responses in an in vivo mouse model of endotoxin shock following 
LPS challenge. Thus, IinQ represents a novel class of brazilin analogues with 
improved potency and specificity toward disruption of Myddosome complex 
formation in TLR4 signaling, indicating that IinQ may be a promising therapeutic 
candidate for the treatment of systemic inflammatory diseases.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.bcp.2016.09.017

activation have been linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). However, 
negative regulators of TLR pathways have not been previously investigated in 
this context. Here, we sought to investigate the association of depression 
severity, measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), 
with mRNA expression levels of negative regulators of the TLR pathway, including 
SOCS1, TOLLIP, SIGIRR, MyD88s, NOD2 and TNFAIP3, in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) from 100 patients with MDD and 53 healthy controls, before and 
after treatment with antidepressants. Positive regulators of the TLR4 pathway, 
including Pellino 1, TRAF6 and IRAK1, were also investigated. Among all 
patients, MyD88s, and TNFAIP3 mRNAs were expressed at lower levels in PBMCs from 
patients with MDD. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that TNFAIP3 
mRNA expression before treatment was inversely correlated with severity of 
depression and effectively predicted improvement in HAMD-17 scores. Among 79 
treatment-completers, only TNFAIP3 mRNA was significantly increased by treatment 
with antidepressants for 4 weeks. Treatment of human monocytes (THP-1) and mouse 
microglia (SIM-A9) cell lines with fluoxetine significantly increased TNFAIP3 
mRNA expression and suppressed IL-6 levels. The suppressive effect of fluoxetine 
on IL-6 was attenuated by knockdown of TNFAIP3 expression. These findings 
suggest that both dysfunction of the negative regulatory system in patients with 
MDD and antidepressant treatment exert anti-inflammatory effects, at least in 
part through increased expression of the TNFAIP3 gene. They also indicate that 
modulating expression of the TNFAIP3 gene to rebalance TLR-mediated inflammatory

of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, plays important roles in series of 
malignancies. However, the role of IRAK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
remains little known.
METHODS: In our study, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), Western Blot, and 
immunohistochemical staining were used to assess the mRNA and protein levels of 
IRAK1 in clinical samples and cell lines. Cell counting assay and flow cytometry 
were employed to analyze the effect of IRAK1 on cell cycle and apoptosis. 
Transwell assay was used to study the role of IRAK1 in cell migration. Moreover, 
subcutaneous xenograft tumor models predict the efficacy of targeting IRAK1 
against HCC in vivo.
RESULTS: IRAK1 was over-expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. Suppression of 
IRAK1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) or a pharmaceutical IRAK1/4 inhibitor 
impeded cell growth, induced apoptosis and lessened HCC xenograft tumor growth. 
Particularly, IRAK1/4 inhibitor treatment caused G1/S cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis, confirming IRAK1 as a new therapeutic target for HCC.
CONCLUSION: IRAK1 promotes cell proliferation and protects against apoptosis in 
HCC, and can be a novel target for HCC treatment.","DOI: 10.1186/s13046-016-0413-0

risk; however, the results were inconsistent.
AIM: A case control study was carried out to explore the association between 
IRAK1 rs3027898 and miR-499 rs3746444 and the RA risk in a Chinese population. 
Meta-analyses combining present with previous studies were conducted to further 
explore the association.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 386 RA patients were enrolled along with 
576 matched healthy controls. Genotyping was performed by using TaqMan 
genotyping assays on Fluidigm 192.24 system. For the meta-analysis, a systematic 
literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies.
RESULTS: This case control study showed that the IRAK1 rs3027898 C allele was 
associated with increased risk of RA with an odds ratio (OR) = 1.4 and 95 % 
confidence intervals (CI) = 1.093-1.793, P = 0.008 but miR-499 rs3746444

meta-analyses included a total of 4 case control studies on IRAK1 rs3027898 and 
4 studies on miR-499 rs3746444. The IRAK1 rs3027898 C allele had an overall OR 
of 1.268 (95 % CI = 1.130-1.424, P < 0.001). After stratification by ethnicity

been reportedly used for the treatment of arthritis, cancer, and inflammation. 
Although its anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated 
inflammatory cells has been reported, the exact mechanism of its 
anti-inflammatory action has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the aim of 
this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of bee venom in 
BV2 microglial cells. We first investigated whether NO production in 
LPS-activated BV2 cells was inhibited by bee venom, and further iNOS mRNA and 
protein expressions were determined. The mRNA and protein levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines were examined using semiquantitative RT-PCR and 
immunoblotting, respectively. Moreover, modulation of the transcription factor 
NF-κB by bee venom was also investigated using a luciferase assay. LPS-induced 
NO production in BV2 microglial cells was significantly inhibited in a 
concentration-dependent manner upon pretreatment with bee venom. Bee venom 
markedly reduced the mRNA expression of COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and 
suppressed LPS-induced activation of MyD88 and IRAK1 and phosphorylation of 
TAK1. Moreover, NF-κB translocation by IKKα/β phosphorylation and subsequent 
IκB-α degradation were also attenuated. Thus, collectively, these results 
indicate that bee venom exerts its anti-inflammatory activity via the

glycosaminoglycan chains) has been shown to protect neonatal cardiomyocytes 
against simulated ischemia/reperfusion injury (SI/R), however, the mechanism of 
action is not clear. In this study we aimed to investigate, which structural 
component of biglycan is responsible for its cardiocytoprotective effect and to 
further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the cytoprotection.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A pilot study was conducted to demonstrate that both native 
(glycanated) and deglycanated biglycan can attenuate cell death induced by SI/R 
in a dose-dependent manner in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from 
Wistar rats. In separate experiments, we have shown that similarly to glycanated 
biglycan, recombinant human biglycan core protein (rhBGNc) protects 
cardiomyocytes against SI/R injury. In contrast, the glycosaminoglycan component 
dermatan sulfate had no significant effect on cell viability, while chondroitin 
sulfate further enhanced cell death induced by SI/R. Treatment of cardiomyocytes 
with rhBGNc reverses the effect of SI/R upon markers of necrosis, apoptosis, 
mitochondrial membrane potential, and autophagy. We have also shown that 
pharmacological blockade of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling or its 
downstream mediators (IRAK1/4, ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases) abolished the 
cytoprotective effect of rhBGNc against SI/R injury. Pretreatment of 
cardiomyocytes with rhBGNc for 20h resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation and 
NO production without having significant effect on phosphorylation of ERK1/2, 
STAT3, and on the production of superoxide. Treatment over 10min and 1h with 
rhBGNc increased ERK1 phosphorylation, while the SI/R-induced increase in 
superoxide production was attenuated by rhBGNc. Blockade of NO synthesis also 
prevented the cardiocytoprotective effect of rhBGNc.
CONCLUSIONS: The core protein of exogenous biglycan protects myocardial cells 
from SI/R injury via TLR4-mediated mechanisms involving activation of ERK, JNK 
and p38 MAP kinases and increased NO production. The cytoprotective effect of 
rhBGNc is due to modulation of SI/R-induced changes in necrosis, apoptosis and 
autophagy.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.08.006

express proinflammatory chemokines and antiviral cytokines that play a role in 
innate immunity. Previously, we demonstrated that RV interaction with TLR2 
causes ILR-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) depletion in both airway epithelial 
cells and macrophages. Further, IRAK-1 degradation caused by TLR2 activation was 
shown to inhibit ssRNA-induced IFN expression in dendritic cells. Therefore, in 
this study, we examined the role of TLR2 and IRAK-1 in RV-induced IFN-β, IFN-λ1, 
and CXCL-10, which require signaling by viral RNA. In airway epithelial cells, 
blocking TLR2 enhanced RV-induced expression of IFNs and CXCL-10. By contrast, 
IRAK-1 inhibition abrogated RV-induced expression of CXCL-10, but not IFNs in 
these cells. Neutralization of IL-33 or its receptor, ST2, which requires IRAK-1 
for signaling, inhibited RV-stimulated CXCL-10 expression. In addition, RV 
induced expression of both ST2 and IL-33 in airway epithelial cells. In 
macrophages, however, RV-stimulated CXCL-10 expression was primarily dependent 
on TLR2/IL-1R. Interestingly, in a mouse model of RV infection, blocking ST2 not 
only attenuated RV-induced CXCL-10, but also lung inflammation. Finally, 
influenza- and respiratory syncytial virus-induced CXCL-10 was also found to be 
partially dependent on IL-33/ST2/IRAK-1 signaling in airway epithelial cells. 
Together, our results indicate that RV stimulates CXCL-10 expression via the 
IL-33/ST2 signaling axis, and that TLR2 signaling limits RV-induced CXCL-10 via 
IRAK-1 depletion at least in airway epithelial cells. To our knowledge, this is 
the first report to demonstrate the role of respiratory virus-induced IL-33 in 
the induction of CXCL-10 in airway epithelial cells.","Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1502702

pathogens in the middle ear has been shown to play a key role in OM 
susceptibility, pathogenesis and recovery. Recent studies implicate microRNA 146 
(miR-146) in regulation of inflammation via negative feedback of toll-like 
receptor signaling (TLR) in a wide variety of tissues, however its involvement 
in otitis media is unknown.
METHODS: Human middle ear epithelial cells were stimulated with proinflammatory 
cytokines, interleukin 1 beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha, for two to 
twenty-four hours. Middle ear biopsies were collected from children with otitis 
media with effusion (n = 20), recurrent otitis media (n = 9), and control 
subjects undergoing cochlear implantation (n = 10). miR-146a, miR-146b 
expression was assayed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Expression of miR-146 targets 
involved in TLR signaling, IRAK1 and TRAF6, was assayed by qPCR in middle ear 
biopsies. Middle ear biopsies were cryosectioned and epithelial thickness 
measured by a certified pathologist.
RESULTS: Proinflammatory cytokines induced expression of miR-146 in middle ear 
epithelial cells in vitro. Middle ear miR-146a and miR-146b expression was 
elevated in otitis media patients relative to control subjects and correlated 
with middle ear epithelial thickness. A trend towards inverse correlation was 
observed between miR-146 and TRAF6 expression in the clinical population.
CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first to assess miRNA expression in a clinical 
population with OM. Findings herein suggest miR-146 may play a role in OM.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2016.06.056

ligands to elicit either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses, but the 
mechanism that dictates such contrasting immune responses is not well 
understood. In this work, we demonstrate that proline-proline-glutamic acid 
(PPE)17 protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces TLR1/2 heterodimerization 
to elicit proinflammatory-type response, whereas PPE18-induced homodimerization 
of TLR2 triggers anti-inflammatory type responses. Ligation of TLR1/2 caused an 
increased recruitment of IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)1, MyD88, and protein 
kinase C (PKC)ε to the downstream TLR-signaling complex that translocated PKCε 
into the nucleus in an IRAK1-dependent manner. PKCε-mediated phosphorylation 
allowed the nuclear IRAK3 to be exported to the cytoplasm, leading to increased 
activation of ERK1/2, stabilization of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), and induction 
of TNF-α with concomitant downregulation of p38MAPK. Silencing of TLR1 inhibited 
PPE17-triggered cytoplasmic export of IRAK3 as well as TNF-α induction, 
suggesting an important role of TLR1/2 heterodimer in regulating proinflammatory 
responses via the IRAK3-signaling pathway. In contrast, PPE18-mediated 
homodimerization of TLR2 caused poorer cytoplasmic export of nuclear IRAK3 and 
MKP-1 stabilization, resulting in increased p38MAPK activation. Our study hints 
to a novel mechanism that implicates PKCε-IRAK3-MKP-1 signaling in the 
regulation of MAPK activity and inflammatory cascades downstream of TLR2 in 
tuberculosis.","Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1501816

Aeromonas hydrophila is becoming ever more widespread in Chinese perch

heterologous on bacteria using anchoring motifs from outer membranes proteins

constructed. Then the ISKNV orf086 was verified to express on the surface of A. 
hydrophila K28 by RT-PCR, western blot and indirect immunofluorescence assay. 
Next, Chinese perch were intraperitoneally inoculated with formalin inactivated 
A. hydrophila k28 emulsified with ISA763 adjuvant with a dose of 9 × 10(8) CFU 
per fish. Transcriptional analysis of non-specific and specific immune related 
genes revealed that the expression levels of IRF-7, IRAK1, Mx, Viperin, Lysozyme 
and IgM were strongly up-regulated in Chinese perch post-inoculation. In 
addition, specific antibodies were detected by ELISA, and the results showed 
that antibody titer against ISKNV or A. hydrophila reached the highest with 
1:800 or 1:1200 on 14dpv, respectively. Lymphocyte proliferation were detected 
by MTT methods, and the results showed that the SI values of AH-K28 vaccinated 
group to three different stimulators were significantly higher than those of

The cumulative mortality rates of vaccinated groups were significantly lower 
than the control one (P < 0.05) after ISKNV or A. hydrophila challenge, and the 
relative percentage survival (RPS) value was 73.3% and 60%, respectively. This 
system provides a novel approach to the surface display of heterologous

investigated the upstream kinase responsible for activation of p38 in 
sarcoidosis alveolar macrophages (AMs) and PBMCs. We identified that sustained 
p38 phosphorylation in sarcoidosis AMs and PBMCs is associated with active MAPK 
kinase 4 but not with MAPK kinase 3/6. Additionally, we found that sarcoidosis 
AMs exhibit a higher expression of IRAK1, IRAK-M, and receptor interacting

with IRAK1/4 inhibitor led to a significant increase in IL-1β mRNA expression 
both spontaneously and in response to TLR2 ligand. However, a combination of 
Rip2 and IRAK-1/4 inhibitors significantly decreased both IL-1β and IL-6 
production in sarcoidosis PBMCs and moderately in AMs. Importantly, a 
combination of Rip2 and IRAK-1/4 inhibitors led to decreased IFN-γ and IL-6 and 
decreased percentage of activated CD4(+)CD25(+) cells in PBMCs. These data 
suggest that in sarcoidosis, both pathways, namely IRAK and Rip2, are

receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathways, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 
(IRAK) family members play essential roles in an animal's immune response. In 
this study, an IRAK family member, designated EcIRAK-1, was identified in the 
orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides, and its role in signal transduction 
investigated. The full-length EcIRAK-1 gene is 2822 bp, encoding a 
760-amino-acid protein that has the typical characteristics of mammalian IRAK-1, 
including an N-terminal death domain, a ProST domain, a central kinase domain, 
and C-terminal C1 and C2 domains. EcIRAK-1 shares 42%-79% sequence identity with 
other fish IRAK-1 proteins, and the death and kinase domains are more conserved 
than the other domains. Several important amino acids and motifs of mammalian 
IRAK-1 are also conserved in the grouper and other piscine IRAK-1s. In healthy 
grouper, EcIRAK-1 was broadly expressed in all the tissues tested, with the 
highest expression in the gill and skin. After infection with Cryptocaryon 
irritans, EcIRAK-1 expression increased in the gill and spleen. After its 
exogenous expression in HEK293T cells, EcIRAK-1 significantly activated nuclear 
factor kappaB (NF-κB). The death domain, ProST domain, and some conserved amino 
acids, such as T58, T207, K237, and T387, in EcIRAK-1 are required for its 
signaling function. These data demonstrate that piscine IRAK-1 has the same 
structural characteristics as its mammalian counterpart and that its function is 
conserved among vertebrates.",Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.fsi.2016.06.030

malignancy. To explore the genetic origins of MEC, we performed systematic 
genomic analyses of these tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing and gene copy-number analyses were 
performed for 18 primary cancers with matched normal tissue. FISH was used to 
determine the presence or absence of the MECT1-MAML2 translocation in 17 tumors.
RESULTS: TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in MEC (28%), and mutations 
were found only in intermediate- and high-grade tumors. Tumors with TP53 
mutations had more mutations overall than tumors without TP53 mutations (P = 
0.006). POU6F2 was the second most frequently mutated gene, found in three 
low-grade MECs with the same in-frame deletion. Somatic alterations in IRAK1, 
MAP3K9, ITGAL, ERBB4, OTOGL, KMT2C, and OBSCN were identified in at least two of 
the 18 tumors sequenced. FISH analysis confirmed the presence of the MECT1-MAML2 
translocation in 15 of 17 tumors (88%).
CONCLUSIONS: Through these integrated genomic analyses, MECT1-MAML2 
translocation and somatic TP53 and POU6F2 mutations appear to be the main 
drivers of MEC. Clin Cancer Res; 23(1); 283-8. ©2016 AACR.",©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.,"DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-0720

inhibit the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB and activator protein

interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and spleen tyrosine kinase 
(Syk). Therefore, our data strongly suggest that AQCA-mediated suppression of

isotype-specific effects remain poorly understood. Therefore, we examined the 
effect of the ApoE isotype on the brain levels of major regulators of TLR 
signaling including miR146a, a microRNA enriched in the brain. We used 
6-month-old ApoE3 or ApoE4 targeted replacement mice with and without mutant

both in the brain (29%; P<0.0001) and in plasma (47%; P<0.05), which correlated 
with each other (r=0.74; P<0.05). The presence of 5xFAD transgenes increased 
brain miR146a in both ApoE3 (E3FAD) and ApoE4 (E4FAD) mice; however, miR146a 
levels in E4FAD mice remained lower than those in E3FAD mice (62%; P<0.05), 
despite increased amyloid and inflammation. Supporting these observations, ApoE4 
brains showed increased expression of interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1 
(160%; P<0.05) (normally downregulated by miR146) that correlated inversely with 
miR146a levels (r=0.637; P<0.0001). Reduced negative feedback of toll-like 
receptor signaling (by miRNA146a) can explain early-life hypersensitivity to 
innate immune stimuli (including Aβ) in ApoE4 carriers. Thus, ApoE4 causes early 
dysregulation of a central controller of the innate immune system both centrally 
and systemically. This defect persists with familial AD pathology and may be 
relevant to ApoE4 AD risk.","DOI: 10.1097/WNR.0000000000000608

obesity and asthma severity. Here, we examined the effects of diet-induced 
obesity (DIO) on the expression levels of IL-1β, IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 mRNA in male 
Wistar rats tracheal after sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty male Wistar rats divided to four groups, included, 
control group with normal diet (C+ND), OVA-sensitized group with normal diet 
(S+ND), control group with high-fat diet (C+HFD), and OVA-sensitized group with 
high-fat diet (S+HFD). All animals fed for 8 weeks with standard pelts or 
high-fat diet, and then were sensitized and challenged with OVA or saline for 
another 4 weeks with designed regimens. At the end of study, trachea isolated 
and examined for expression levels of IL-1β, IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 mRNA with RT-PCR 
method.
RESULTS: Diet-induced obesity groups developed increased weight, obesity indexes 
and lipid profiles (P<0.05 to P<0.001). The expression levels of IL-1β mRNA in 
OVA-sensitization groups (S+ND and S+HFD) showed a significantly increased when 
compared with control group. Also in S+HFD group, expression level of TRAF-6 
mRNA was higher than other groups (P<0.001). IRAK-1 expression level was high in 
S+HFD compared with control group.IL-1β and TRAF-6 mRNA correlated positively 
with obesity indexes.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that DIO causes overexpression of IL-1β, IRAK-1

in obese-asthmatic conditions locally production and activation of 
pro-inflammatory agents can be increased. These findings showed that possible

monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs). Ox-LDL (40 μg/mL, 15 minutes-48 hours) 
treatment induced time-dependent increase in IRAK1, IRAK4, and Stat1 activation 
in THP-1 derived macrophages. IRAK1/4 inhibitor (INH) or IRAK1 siRNA 
significantly attenuated cholesterol accumulation, DiI-Ox-LDL binding, and

SR-BI was decreased. IRAK1/4 inhibition or IRAK1 knockdown, however, attenuated 
Ox-LDL-induced CD36 expression; augmented ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression while 
expression of others was unaffected in THP-1 derived macrophages and HMDMs. 
Moreover, IRAK1/4 inhibition had no significant effect on genes involved in 
lipid biosynthesis. In IRAK1/4 INH pre-treated THP-1 derived macrophages 
Ox-LDL-induced Stat1 phosphorylation and its binding to CD36 promoter was 
significantly attenuated while LXRα expression and its binding to the

autoimmunity. During inflammation process toll like receptor 4(TLR4) responds to 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of the bacterial components, and TLR4 signaling

factor of inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, NF-ĸB over activation induces 
miR-146a in innate immune cells which can consequently reduce TRAF6, IRAK1, and 
NF-ĸB activation in a negative feedback. G2013 is a novel designed non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which was recently shown to be effective in 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate G2013 effects on inflammatory (IRAK1 and TRAF6) and

activation inhibitor; however, the exact mechanism behind this action is still 
unknown. Using text-mining technology, the authors predicted that interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are potential celastrol targets, and 
hypothesized that targeting IRAKs might be one way that celastrol inhibits 
NF-κB. This is because IRAKs are key molecules for some crucial pathways to 
activate NF-κB (e.g., the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)/Toll-like receptor 
(TLR) superfamily).
METHODS: The human hepatocellular cell line (HepG2) treated with palmitic acid 
(PA) was used as a model for stimulating TLR4/NF-κB activation, in order to 
observe the potential effects of celastrol in IRAK regulation and NF-κB 
inhibition. The transfection of small interfering RNA was used for 
down-regulating TLR4, IRAK1 and IRAK4, and the Western blot method was used to 
detect changes in the protein expressions.
RESULTS: The results showed that celastrol could effectively inhibit PA-caused 
TLR4-dependent NF-κB activation in the HepG2 cells; PA also activated IRAKs, 
which were inhibited by celastrol. Knocking down IRAKs abolished PA-caused NF-κB 
activation.
CONCLUSION: The results for the first time show that targeting IRAKs is one way 
in which celastrol inhibits NF-κB activation.","DOI: 10.1016/S2095-4964(16)60257-1

protein 2 gene (MECP2) are observed most in males with a severe 
neurodevelopmental disorder associated with hypotonia, spasticity, severe 
learning disability, delayed psychomotor development, and recurrent pulmonary 
infections. Most female carriers are asymptomatic due to extremely or completely 
skewed X-inactivation.
METHODS: A retrospective clinical and molecular study was conducted to examine 
16 patients and two fetuses from 10 families who were identified among patients 
with Xq28 duplications who presented at genetic clinics.
RESULTS: Of all 16 patients, 10 had a family history. Only one patient was 
female. All of the patients had no relevant pre-natal history. All of the 
patients exhibited severe psychomotor developmental delay, infantile hypotonia 
and recurrent infections. Some of the patients exhibited cardiac abnormalities, 
gastrointestinal mobility problems, hydrocele of tunica vaginalis, 
cryptorchidism, and autistic phenotypes. Additionally, neonatal kidney calculus, 
premature closure of the fontanel and pulmonary sequestration were found in the 
patients. Duplication sizes in these patients range from 0.21 to 14.391 Mb (most 
were smaller than 1 Mb), and all the duplications included host cell factor C1 
(HCFC1), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and MECP2. 
Bioinformatics analysis revealed that approximately half of the distal 
breakpoints were located within the low-copy repeats (LCRs), which may be 
involved in the recombination. The two fetuses were found to be healthy in the 
prenatal diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: This is the first large cohort of patients with MECP2 duplication 
syndrome, including a female, reported in China. Interestingly, neonatal kidney 
calculus, premature closure of the fontanel and pulmonary sequestration were 
first reported in this syndrome. However, it was difficult to distinguish if 
these patients represented unique cases or if these phenotypes can be considered 
as part of the syndrome. The correlation between the infrequent phenotypes and 
duplications/genes in the duplication region needs further systematic 
delineation. In conclusion, our study suggested that it is important to 
emphasize molecular genetic analysis in patients with developmental 
delay/intellectual disability and recurrent infections and that it is especially 
important for familial female carriers to accept prenatal diagnosis.",Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmg.2016.05.004

used to treat several diseases in Asia. Reports document that T. nucifera has 
anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative activities. In spite of numerous 
findings on its pharmacological effects, the understanding of the molecular 
inhibitory mechanisms of the plant remains to be studied. Therefore, we aimed to 
explore in vitro anti-inflammatory mechanisms of ethyl acetate fraction 
(Tn-EE-BF) prepared from the seed of T. nucifera in LPS-stimulated macrophage 
inflammatory responses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, we measured nitric oxide (NO) and 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Additionally, using 
RT-PCR, luciferase reporter gene assay, immunoblotting analysis, and kinase 
assay, the levels of inflammatory genes, transcription factors, and inflammatory 
signal-regulatory proteins were investigated. Finally, the constituent of 
Tn-EE-BF was identified using HPLC.
RESULTS: Tn-EE-BF inhibits NO and PGE2 production and also blocks mRNA levels of 
inducible NO synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and cyclooxygenase 
(COX)-2 in a dose dependent manner. Tn-EE-BF reduces nuclear levels of the 
transcriptional factors NF-κB (p65) and AP-1 (c-Jun and FRA-1). Surprisingly, we 
found that Tn-EE-BF inhibits phosphorylation levels of Src and Syk in the NF-κB 
pathway, as well as, IRAK1 at the protein level, part of the AP-1 pathway. By 
kinase assay, we confirmed that Src, Syk, and IRAK1 are suppressed directly. 
HPLC analysis indicates that arctigenin, amentoflavone, and quercetin may be 
active components with anti-inflammatory activities.

Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, ameliorates neurological

investigated. Using rat primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons cultured in a

disease affecting multiple organs in the body, but therapeutic options are still 
very limited and often come with adverse effects. Increasing evidence has 
underlined an important role of the Toll-like receptor 7 
(TLR-7)/TLR-9/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1)/interferon 
regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) pathway in the development and progression of SLE. 
Notably, the prolyl isomerase Pin1 is an essential regulator of IRAK-1 in 
TLR-7/TLR-9 signaling, but its role in SLE is unknown. We undertook this study 
to determine whether Pin1 is activated and plays any role in the development and 
treatment of SLE.
METHODS: Activation of Pin1 and TLR-7/TLR-9/IRAK-1/IRF-7 signaling was 
determined in various cell types among peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 
healthy controls and SLE patients. The effects of Pin1 and TLR signaling on SLE 
development were determined using validated Pin1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), Pin1 
genetic knockout, and the small-molecule Pin1 inhibitor all-trans-retinoic acid 
(ATRA) in immune cells and in several strains of lupus-prone mice.
RESULTS: We found abnormal activation of Pin1 and its downstream targets IRAK-1 
and IRF-7 in SLE patients. Furthermore, inhibition of Pin1 using either 
validated Pin1 shRNA or ATRA blocked TLR-7-induced activation of IRAK-1 and 
IRF-7 in SLE patient-derived immune cells. Moreover, in multiple lupus-prone 
animals, both Pin1 knockout and ATRA strikingly attenuated the expression of 
autoimmunity, including skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, 
glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, and production of anti-double-stranded DNA 
antibodies and CD4-CD8- T cells, and also prolonged overall survival in MRL/lpr 
and B6.lpr mice.
CONCLUSION: Pin1 plays a critical role in the development of SLE, and 
Pin1-targeted therapy offers a promising new strategy for treating SLE.","© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.","DOI: 10.1002/art.39741

atherosclerosis, especially in diabetes. Functional deficiency of IRAK4 inhibits 
the formation of vascular lesions in ApoE-/- mice. Therefore, in this study, we 
examined the functions of IRAK4 in the regulation of VSMCs differentiation and 
phenotypic modulation at the levels of transcription and translation in T2D 
rats. The T2D rat model was generated by feeding a high-fat diet and injecting a 
low dose of streptozotocin intraperitoneally. VSMCs were isolated from the 
thoracic aortas of the T2D rats. VSMCs proliferation and migration were measured 
using water soluble tetrazolium salt-1 assay, 5-ethynyl-29-deoxyuridine staining 
and migration assay. IRAK4 was knocked down by siRNA and inhibited by an IRAK1/4 
inhibitor. The mRNAs and proteins of signal molecules and phenotypic markers 
were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The results demonstrated that LPS 
significantly increased viability, cell migration rate and amount of DNA in 
VSMCs. The IRAK4 inhibitor also reduced LPS-mediated protein expression of 
myosin heavy chain and nuclear factor κB p65 subunit and increased smooth muscle 
22α expression. Moreover, IRAK4 knock-down reduced the LPS-mediated expression 
of mRNAs for myosin heavy chain, nuclear factor κB p65 subunit, and monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), but increased the mRNA of smooth muscle 22α 
in VSMCs. The activation of IRAK4 phenotypically modulated VSMCs from 
differentiation to dedifferentiation. Inactivation of IRAK4 exerts a protective 
effect on VSMCs differentiation and inhibits inflammation. IRAK4 could therefore 
be a target for interventions to prevent and treat the initial phase of 
atherosclerosis.","PMCID: PMC4846934

Gram-negative bacteria. This includes Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), a 
causative agent of severe pneumonia. Upon its transmission into the lung, L. 
pneumophila primarily infects and replicates within macrophages. Here, we 
analyzed the influence of L. pneumophila OMVs on macrophages. To this end, 
differentiated THP-1 cells were incubated with increasing doses of Legionella 
OMVs, leading to a TLR2-dependent classical activation of macrophages with the 
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of TLR2 and NF-κB signaling 
reduced the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, treatment of 
THP-1 cells with OMVs prior to infection reduced replication of L. pneumophila 
in THP-1 cells. Blocking of TLR2 activation or heat denaturation of OMVs 
restored bacterial replication in the first 24 h of infection. With prolonged 
infection-time, OMV pre-treated macrophages became more permissive for bacterial 
replication than untreated cells and showed increased numbers of 
Legionella-containing vacuoles and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine induction. 
Additionally, miRNA-146a was found to be transcriptionally induced by OMVs and 
to facilitate bacterial replication. Accordingly, IRAK-1, one of miRNA-146a's 
targets, showed prolonged activation-dependent degradation, which rendered THP-1 
cells more permissive for Legionella replication. In conclusion, L. pneumophila 
OMVs are initially potent pro-inflammatory stimulators of macrophages, acting 
via TLR2, IRAK-1, and NF-κB, while at later time points, OMVs facilitate L. 
pneumophila replication by miR-146a-dependent IRAK-1 suppression. OMVs might 
thereby promote spreading of L. pneumophila in the host.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005592

anthraquinones identified from Brazilian taheebo, ameliorated various 
inflammatory and algesic symptoms in EtOH/HCl- and acetylsalicylic acid- (ASA-) 
induced gastritis, arachidonic acid-induced edema, and acetic acid-induced 
abdominal writhing without displaying toxic profiles in body and organ weight, 
gastric irritation, or serum parameters. In addition, AQCA suppressed the 
expression of inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 in stomach 
tissues and lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) treated RAW264.7 cells. According to 
reporter gene assay and immunoblotting analyses, AQCA inhibited activation of 
the nuclear factor- (NF-) κB and activator protein- (AP-) 1 pathways by 
suppression of upstream signaling involving interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 4 (IRAK1), p38, Src, and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Our data strongly 
suggest that anthraquinones such as AQCA act as potent anti-inflammatory and 
antinociceptive components in vivo, thus contributing to the immune regulatory 
role of fruits and herbs.","DOI: 10.1155/2016/1903849

neuroprotective approach whereby a low dose of stimulus confers significant 
protection against subsequent substantial brain damage by reprogramming the 
ischemia-activated TLRs signaling. Herein, we aim to explore whether 
preconditioning with recombinant high-mobility group box 1 (rHMGB1), one of the 
TLRs ligands, decreases cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Rats were 
intracerebroventricularly pretreated with rHMGB1, 1 or 3 days before induction 
of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Results showed that preconditioning with 
rHMGB1 1 day, but not 3 days, prior to ischemia dramatically reduced 
neurological deficits, infarct size, brain swelling, cell apoptosis, and 
blood-brain barrier permeability. Interleukin-1R-associated kinase-M (IRAK-M), a 
critical negative regulator of TLRs signaling, was robustly increased in 
response to brain IRI and was further elevated by rHMGB1 pretreatment, 
indicating its role associated with the rHMGB1 preconditioning-mediated ischemic 
tolerance. In vitro and in vivo assays indicated that the induced IRAK-M 
expression was localized in microglia. In addition, TLR4 specific inhibitor 
TAK-242 abolished the neuroprotective effects and the induction of IRAK-M 
offered by rHMGB1 preconditioning. Collectively, our study demonstrates that 
rHMGB1 preconditioning is neuroprotective during cerebral IRI, which is 
associated with activated TLR4/IRAK-M signaling in microglia. We found that 
high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) pretreatment conditioned the brain against 
subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury. We propose the following mechanism for 
HMGB1 preconditioning-mediated ischemic tolerance: through toll-like receptor 
TLR4, HMGB1 preconditioning magnifies the up-regulation of 
interleukin-1R-associated kinase-M (IRAK-M) induced by ischemia-reperfusion in 
microglia, resulting in the decreased phosphorylation of IRAK-1. These findings 
are helpful in understanding the endogenous mechanisms that counteract ischemic 
insults.",© 2016 International Society for Neurochemistry.,"DOI: 10.1111/jnc.13611

inflammatory response in neuroglia cell (microglia).
METHODS: BV2 cells were transfected by MiR-146a mimics,and then stimulated by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). MiR-146a expression was measured by real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). Interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNFα) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
Furthermore, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) were detected by PCR and Western blotting.
RESULTS: Compared to the normal control group, MiR-146a expression was 
significantly elevated by transfection with MiR-146a mimics (t=5.846, P=0.0021). 
The expression levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, TNFα, and IL-6 significantly increased in 
the LPS-stimulated BV2 cells compared to the non-stimulated BV2. The enhancement 
of MiR-146a resulted in significantly decreased IL-6 (t=5.200, P=0.0003) and

(t=6.980, P=0.0009) levels of TRAF6, but not IRAK1, also significantly 
decreased.

derivative, have been shown to have cytoprotective effects against H2O2-induced 
oxidative stress in human endothelial cells. However, little is known about its 
anti-inflammatory effects in lupus nephritis (LN). In the present study, we 
investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of CSTMP on lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (hRPTECs) and 
elucidated its molecular mechanisms. CSTMP significantly attenuated the 
cytotoxicity and suppressed the release of proinflammatory mediators, including 
iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, CCL-2, ICAM-1, IL-1β, and MCP-1 in LPS-induced

interactions with these adapter molecules in LPS-induced hRPTECs, resulting in 
an inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/TAK1/ TRAF6/IRAK1 complex. Moreover, CSTMP also 
attenuated phosphorylation of IκB and IKK-α/β, and P50-NF-κB and P65-NF-κB

senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), able to promote inflammaging 
and cancer progression. Emerging evidence suggest that preventing SASP 
development could help to slow the rate of aging and the progression of

whether and how adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a major SASP component, can prevent the SASP. A 
three-pronged approach has been adopted to assess the if adalimumab is able to: 
i) modulate a panel of classic and novel senescence- and SASP-associated markers 
(interleukin [IL]-6, senescence associated-β-galactosidase, p16/Ink4a, 
plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, 
miR-146a-5p/Irak1 and miR-126-3p/Spred1) in human umbilical vein endothelial

iii) exert significant decrease of miR-146a-5p and increase of miR-126-3p in 
circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) from psoriasis patients receiving adalimumab 
in monotherapy.TNF-α blockade associated with adalimumab induced significant

miR-146a-5p expression levels both in long-term HUVEC cultures and in CACs 
isolated from psoriasis patients was also evident. Interestingly, conditioned 
medium from senescent HUVECs treated with adalimumab was less consistent than 
medium from untreated cells in inducing migration- and mammosphere- promoting 
effects on MCF-7 cells.Our findings suggest that adalimumab can induce 
epigenetic modifications in cells undergoing senescence, thus contributing to 
the attenuation of SASP tumor-promoting effects.","DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.7858

translocation is a key determinant of human immunodeficiency virus/simian 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV/SIV) disease progression. Although extensive 
research on inflammation has focused on studying protein regulators, increasing 
evidence suggests a critical role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating several 
aspects of the immune/inflammatory response and immune cell proliferation, 
differentiation, and activation. To understand their immunoregulatory role, we 
profiled miRNA expression sequentially in intestinal lamina propria leukocytes 
(LPLs) of eight macaques before and at 21, 90, and 180 days postinfection (dpi). 
At 21 dpi, ∼20 and 9 miRNAs were up- and downregulated, respectively. However, 
at 90 dpi (n = 60) and 180 dpi (n = 44), ≥75% of miRNAs showed decreased 
expression. Notably, the T-cell activation-associated miR-15b, miR-142-3p, 
miR-142-5p, and miR-150 expression was significantly downregulated at 90 and 180 
dpi. Out of ∼10 downregulated miRNAs predicted to regulate CD69, we confirmed 
miR-92a to directly target CD69. Interestingly, the SIV-induced miR-190b 
expression was elevated at all time points. Additionally, elevated 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive miR-146b-5p expression at 180 dpi was 
confirmed in primary intestinal macrophages following LPS treatment in vitro 
Further, reporter and overexpression assays validated IRAK1 (interleukin-1 
receptor 1 kinase) as a direct miR-150 target. Furthermore, IRAK1 protein levels 
were markedly elevated in intestinal LPLs and epithelium. Finally, blockade of 
CD8(+) T-cell activation/proliferation with delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol 
(Δ(9)-THC) significantly prevented miR-150 downregulation and IRAK1 
upregulation. Our findings suggest that miR-150 downregulation during T-cell 
activation disrupts the translational control of IRAK1, facilitating persistent 
gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation. Finally, the ability of Δ(9)-THC to block 
the miR-150-IRAK1 regulatory cascade highlights the potential of cannabinoids to 
inhibit persistent inflammation/immune activation in HIV/SIV infection.
IMPORTANCE: Persistent GI tract disease/inflammation is a cardinal feature of 
HIV/SIV infection. Increasing evidence points to a critical role for miRNAs in 
controlling several aspects of the immune/inflammatory response. Here, we show 
significant dysregulation of miRNA expression exclusively in the intestinal 
lamina propria cellular compartment through the course of SIV infection. 
Specifically, the study identified miRNA signatures associated with key 
pathogenic events, such as viral replication, T-cell activation, and microbial 
translocation. The T-cell-enriched miR-150 showed significant downregulation 
throughout SIV infection and was confirmed to target IRAK1, a critical 
signal-transducing component of the IL-1 receptor and TLR signaling pathways. 
Reduced miR-150 expression was associated with markedly elevated IRAK1 
expression in the intestines of chronically SIV-infected macaques. Finally, 
Δ(9)-THC-mediated blockade of CD8(+) T-cell activation in vitro significantly 
inhibited miR-150 downregulation and IRAK1 upregulation, suggesting its 
potential for targeted immune modulation in HIV infection.","Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.","DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00189-16

Therefore, we genotyped Saudi CD patients and healthy controls for three

MMEL1 genes. Single locus analysis identified that carriers of the 518 Thr/Thr 
(MMEL1) genotype conferred a 1.6-fold increased disease risk compared to the 
noncarriers (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.22-5.54; P < 0.01). This significance persisted 
even under allelic (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.05-2.28; P = 0.02) and additive (OR = 
0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.71; P = 0.03) genetic models. However, frequencies for 
Trp262Arg (SH2B3) and Phe196Ser (IRAK1) polymorphisms were not significantly 
different between patients and controls. The overall best MDR model included 
Met518Thr and Trp262Arg polymorphisms, with a maximal testing accuracy of 64.1% 
and a maximal cross-validation consistency of 10 out of 10 (P = 0.0156). Allelic 
distribution of the 518 Thr/Thr polymorphism in MMEL1 primarily suggests its 
independent and synergistic contribution towards CD susceptibility among Saudi

in Saudi patients but their association in European groups suggests the genetic

response to P. gingivalis. IRF6 and IL-1R-associated kinase 1 also regulated the 
stimulation of IL-36γ expression by a TLR2 agonist. IL-36γ was shown to elicit 
inflammatory responses by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and 
macrophages, including the expression of the neutrophil chemokines IL-8 and 
CXCL1, as well as the Th17 chemokine CCL20. IL-36γ similarly stimulated their 
expression by human oral epithelial cells. Significantly, the Th17 cytokine 
IL-17 not only stimulated the expression of important regulators of neutrophil 
recruitment and survival by oral epithelial cells, but IL-17 also stimulated 
them to express IL-36γ. Thus, our findings suggest that IRF6 is likely to 
promote inflammation to P. gingivalis through its regulation of IL-36γ.","Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1501263

reported member of the IL-1 cytokine family. In this study, we investigated 
IL-36 expression in the inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease and characterized the proinflammatory actions of IL-36 cytokines in 
human colonic epithelial cells.
METHODS: IL-36 mRNA expression was evaluated using real-time PCR. IL-36 protein 
expression was analyzed using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical technique. 
Intracellular signaling pathways were evaluated by immunoblotting and by 
specific siRNA-transfected cells.
RESULTS: The mRNA expression of IL-36α and IL-36γ, but not of IL-36β, was 
enhanced in the inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, in 
particular, in ulcerative colitis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that T 
cells, monocytes, and plasma cells are the source of IL-36α and IL-36γ in 
colonic mucosa. DNA microarray analysis indicated that IL-36α induces the mRNA 
expression of CXC chemokines and acute phase proteins in intestinal epithelial 
cell line, HT-29 cells. IL-36α and IL-36γ dose-dependently and time-dependently 
induced the mRNA and protein expression of CXC chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 
etc.) in HT-29 and Widr cells. Stimulation with IL-36α and IL-36γ assembled 
MyD88 adaptor proteins (MyD88, TRAF6, IRAK1, and TAK1) into a complex and 
induced the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and also the phosphorylation of MAPKs. 
MAPK inhibitors and siRNAs specific for NF-κB and c-Jun AP-1 significantly 
reduced IL-36-induced CXC chemokine expression.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-36α and IL-36γ may play a proinflammatory role in the 
pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease through induction of CXC 
chemokines and acute phase proteins.","DOI: 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000654

brain repair. Molecular mechanisms that regulate oligodendrogenesis have not 
been fully investigated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules 
that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. MiR-146a has been reported 
to regulate immune response, but the role of miR-146a in oligodendrocyte 
progenitor cells (OPCs) remains unknown. Adult Wistar rats were subjected to the 
right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). In situ hybridization analysis 
with LNA probes against miR-146a revealed that stroke considerably increased 
miR-146a density in the corpus callosum and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the 
lateral ventricle of the ischemic hemisphere. In vitro, overexpression of 
miR-146a in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) significantly increased their 
differentiation into O4+ OPCs. Overexpression of miR-146a in primary OPCs 
increased their expression of myelin proteins, whereas attenuation of endogenous 
miR-146a suppressed generation of myelin proteins. MiR-146a also inversely 
regulated its target gene-IRAK1 expression in OPCs. Attenuation of IRAK1 in OPCs 
substantially increased myelin proteins and decreased OPC apoptosis. 
Collectively, our data suggest that miR-146a may mediate stroke-induced 
oligodendrogenesis.","DOI: 10.1007/s12035-015-9655-7

which mediate the responses of innate immune cells to microbial stimuli. To 
systematically determine the roles of proteins in canonical TLR signaling 
pathways, we conducted an RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen in human and 
mouse macrophages. We observed a pattern of conserved signaling module 
dependencies across species, but found notable species-specific requirements at 
the level of individual proteins. Among these, we identified unexpected 
differences in the involvement of members of the interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family between the human and mouse TLR 
pathways. Whereas TLR signaling in mouse macrophages depended primarily on IRAK4 
and IRAK2, with little or no role for IRAK1, TLR signaling and proinflammatory 
cytokine production in human macrophages depended on IRAK1, with knockdown of 
IRAK4 or IRAK2 having less of an effect. Consistent with species-specific roles 
for these kinases, IRAK4 orthologs failed to rescue signaling in IRAK4-deficient 
macrophages from the other species, and only mouse macrophages required the 
kinase activity of IRAK4 to mediate TLR responses. The identification of a 
critical role for IRAK1 in TLR signaling in humans could potentially explain the 
association of IRAK1 with several autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, this study 
demonstrated how systematic screening can be used to identify important 
characteristics of innate immune responses across species, which could optimize 
therapeutic targeting to manipulate human TLR-dependent outputs.","Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.","DOI: 10.1126/scisignal.aab2191

promoting bacterial intracellular survival, colonization, and pathogenesis. In 
this study, we investigated the function of the virulence-associated effector 
SrfA (SsrAB regulated factor) both in macrophages in vitro and in infected mice 
in vivo. SrfA was secreted into the cytoplasm during S. Typhimurium infection 
and disassociated IL-1R-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) from the IRAK-1-Toll 
interacting protein (Tollip) complex by interacting with Tollip. The released 
IRAK-1 was phosphorylated and subsequently activated the NF-κB signaling 
pathway, which enhanced the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines, 
such as IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α. The coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic 
reticulum degradation aa 183-219 domain of Tollip is the binding region for 
SrfA, and both the MDaa207-226 and CTaa357-377 regions of SrfA mediate binding 
to Tollip and NF-κB signaling activation. Deletion of SrfA in S. Typhimurium had 
no notable effects on its replication but impaired the induction of NF-κB 
activation in infected macrophages. The mice infected with srfA-deficient 
bacteria exhibited a decreased inflammatory response and an increased survival 
rate compared with those infected with wild-type S. Typhimurium. We conclude 
that SrfA is a novel Salmonella virulence effector that helps modulate host 
inflammatory responses by promoting NF-κB signaling activation.","Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1500679

regulator of gene expression in the maintenance and development of the central 
nervous system. Loss- or gain-function of this gene may contribute to 
neurodevelopmental disorders. The aim of this study is to delineate the clinical 
characteristics of MECP2 duplication syndrome and the hereditary mechanism in a 
Chinese family.
CASE PRESENTATION: We identified a Chinese family with three persons carry MECP2 
gene duplication: a boy, his mother and his grandmother. The duplication segment 
which was detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) 
included gene MECP2, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), filamin 
A (FLNA), and L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM). Furthermore, array comparative 
genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed on the mother, showed that MECP2 
containing duplication was 510 Kb (153,113,885-153,624,154), including 16 other 
genes except MECP2. The boy showed most symptoms of MECP2 duplication syndrome. 
His mother and maternal grandmother were asymptomatic. Both female carriers had 
a skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI), which were 80:20 and 74:26 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the second reported Chinese Han family 
with MECP2-containing duplications. And this patient had recurrent respiratory 
infections which was different from the first two Chinese-brother cases. MECP2 
is the core gene responsible for MECP2 duplication syndrome. XCI may play an 
important role in modulating the clinical manifestation.","DOI: 10.1186/s12881-015-0264-0

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder 
whose etiology is incompletely understood, but likely involves environmental 
triggers in genetically susceptible individuals. Using an unbiased genome-wide 
association (GWA) scan and replication analysis, we sought to identify the 
genetic loci associated with SLE in a Korean population.
METHODS: A total of 1,174 SLE cases and 4,246 population controls from Korea 
were genotyped and analyzed with a GWA scan to identify single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with SLE, after strict quality 
control measures were applied. For select variants, replication of SLE risk loci 
was tested in an independent data set of 1,416 SLE cases and 1,145 population 
controls from Korea and China.
RESULTS: Eleven regions outside the HLA exceeded the genome-wide significance 
level (P = 5 × 10(-8) ). A novel SNP-SLE association was identified between 
FCHSD2 and P2RY2, peaking at rs11235667 (P = 1.03 × 10(-8) , odds ratio [OR] 
0.59) on a 33-kb haplotype upstream of ATG16L2. In the independent replication 
data set, the SNP rs11235667 continued to show a significant association with 
SLE (replication meta-analysis P = 0.001, overall meta-analysis P = 6.67 × 
10(-11) ; OR 0.63). Within the HLA region, the SNP-SLE association peaked in the 
class II region at rs116727542, with multiple independent effects observed in 
this region. Classic HLA allele imputation analysis identified HLA-DRB1*1501 and 
HLA-DQB1*0602, each highly correlated with one another, as most strongly 
associated with SLE. Ten previously established SLE risk loci were replicated: 
STAT1-STAT4, TNFSF4, TNFAIP3, IKZF1, HIP1, IRF5, BLK, WDFY4, ETS1, and 
IRAK1-MECP2. Of these loci, previously unreported, independent second risk 
effects of SNPs in TNFAIP3 and TNFSF4, as well as differences in the association 
with a putative causal variant in the WDFY4 region, were identified.
CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to identify true SLE risk effects in 
other loci suggestive of a significant association, and to identify the causal 
variants in the regions of ATG16L2, FCHSD2, and P2RY2.","© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.","DOI: 10.1002/art.39548

of renal diseases. Locally secreted chemokines mediated leukocyte recruitment 
during the initiation and amplification phase of renal inflammation. However, 
the regulation of chemokine induction is not fully understood. In this study, we 
found that IL-1 induced a significant up-regulation of CXC chemokines CXCL1, 2, 
and 8 at both mRNA and protein levels in human mesangial cells. The induction of 
chemokines was tolerant, as the pre-treatment of HMC with IL-1 down-regulated 
the induction of chemokines induced by IL-1 re-stimulation. IL-1 up-regulated 
the ubiquintin-editing enzyme A20. A20 over-expression down-regulated 
IL-1-induced up-regulation of chemokines, and A20 down-regulation reversed 
chemokine inhibition induced by IL-1 pre-treatment, suggested that A20 played 
important roles in the tolerant production of chemokines. Unexpectedly, A20 
over- expression inhibited the activation of ERK, JNK, and P38, but did not 
inhibit the activation of NF-κB. In addition, both IL-1 treatment and A20 
over-expression induced the degradation of IRAK1, an important adaptor for 
IL-1R1 signaling, and A20 inhibition by RNA interference partly reversed the

speciosa L. (Banaba) leaves, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by regulating 
phosphorylation of interleukin receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-2 via the NF-κB 
cascade. However, the protective effect of CA against endotoxic shock has not 
been reported. LPS (200 ng/mL, 30 min) induced phosphorylation of IRAK-1 and 
treatment with CA (10 μM) significantly attenuated this effect. In addition, CA 
also reduced protein levels of NLRP3 and ASC which are the main components of 
the inflammasome in BMDMs. LPS-induced inflammasome assembly through activation 
of IRAK-1 was down-regulated by CA challenge. Treatment with Bay11-7082, an 
inhibitor of IκB-α, had no effect on CA-mediated inhibition of IRAK-1 
activation, indicating that CA-mediated attenuation of IRAK-1 phosphorylation 
was independent of NF-κB signaling. These results demonstrate that CA 
ameliorates acute inflammation in mouse BMDMs and CA may be useful as a

with a strong genetic component. We undertook the present work to perform the 
first genome-wide association study on individuals from the Americas who are 
enriched for Native American heritage.
METHODS: We analyzed 3,710 individuals from the US and 4 countries of Latin 
America who were diagnosed as having SLE, and healthy controls. Samples were 
genotyped with HumanOmni1 BeadChip. Data on out-of-study controls genotyped with 
HumanOmni2.5 were also included. Statistical analyses were performed using 
SNPtest and SNPGWA. Data were adjusted for genomic control and false discovery 
rate. Imputation was performed using Impute2 and, for classic HLA alleles, 
HiBag. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The IRF5-TNPO3 region showed the strongest association and largest OR 
for SLE (rs10488631: genomic control-adjusted P [Pgcadj ] = 2.61 × 10(-29), OR 
2.12 [95% CI 1.88-2.39]), followed by HLA class II on the DQA2-DQB1 loci 
(rs9275572: Pgcadj  = 1.11 × 10(-16), OR 1.62 [95% CI 1.46-1.80] and rs9271366: 
Pgcadj  = 6.46 × 10(-12), OR 2.06 [95% CI 1.71-2.50]). Other known SLE loci 
found to be associated in this population were ITGAM, STAT4, TNIP1, NCF2, and 
IRAK1. We identified a novel locus on 10q24.33 (rs4917385: Pgcadj  = 1.39 × 
10(-8)) with an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effect (Peqtl  = 8.0 
× 10(-37) at USMG5/miR1307), and several new suggestive loci. SLE risk loci 
previously identified in Europeans and Asians were corroborated. Local ancestry 
estimation showed that the HLA allele risk contribution is of European ancestral 
origin. Imputation of HLA alleles suggested that autochthonous Native American 
haplotypes provide protection against development of SLE.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that studying admixed populations provides 
new insights in the delineation of the genetic architecture that underlies 
autoimmune and complex diseases.","© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.","DOI: 10.1002/art.39504

shown that immunological and inflammatory elements play important roles in the 
initiation and development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs) comprise a superfamily of innate immune system receptors. The roles and 
mechanisms of TLRs in the pathogenesis of diabetic renal lesions are mostly 
unknown. Compared with rodents, miniature pigs are more similar to humans with 
respect to metabolism, kidney structure, and immune system, and therefore 
represent an ideal large-animal model for DN mechanistic studies. A diabetes 
model was established by feeding miniature pigs with high-sugar and high-fat 
diets. Functional and pathological markers, expression and activation of 
endogenous TLR ligands [HSP70 (heat shock protein 70) and HMGB1], TLR1 to TLR11 
and their downstream signaling pathway molecules (MyD88, IRAK-1, and IRF-3), 
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway molecules (IKKβ, IκBα, and 
NF-κBp65), inflammatory cytokines [IL-6 (interleukin-6), MIP-2, MCP-1, CCL5, and 
VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1)], and infiltration of inflammatory 
cells were systematically evaluated. The expression of HSP70 was significantly 
increased in diabetic pig kidneys. The expression of MyD88-dependent TLR2, TLR4, 
TLR5, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR11 and their downstream signaling molecules MyD88 and 
phospho-IRAK-1 (activated IRAK-1), as well as that of MyD88-independent TLR3 and 
TLR4 and their downstream signaling molecule phospho-IRF-3 (activated IRF-3), 
was significantly up-regulated. The expression and activation of NF-κB pathway 
molecules phospho-IKKβ, phospho-IκBα, NF-κBp65, and phospho-NF-κBp65 were 
significantly increased. Levels of IL-6, MIP-2, MCP-1, CCL5, VCAM-1, and 
macrophage marker CD68 were significantly increased in diabetic pig kidneys. 
These results suggested that the metabolic inflammation activated by TLRs might 
play an important role in diabetic renal injuries.","DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.1400183

their lysosomes from small, punctate organelles into a network of tubules. 
Tubular lysosomes have been implicated in phagosome maturation, retention of 
fluid phase, and antigen presentation. There is a growing appreciation that 
lysosomes act as sensors of stress and the metabolic state of the cell through 
the kinase mTOR. Here we show that LPS stimulates mTOR and that mTOR is required 
for LPS-induced lysosome tubulation and secretion of major histocompatibility 
complex II in macrophages and dendritic cells. Specifically, we show that the 
canonical phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway regulates 
LPS-induced lysosome tubulation independently of IRAK1/4 and TBK. Of note, we 
find that LPS treatment augmented the levels of membrane-associated Arl8b, a 
lysosomal GTPase required for tubulation that promotes kinesin-dependent 
lysosome movement to the cell periphery, in an mTOR-dependent manner. This 
suggests that mTOR may interface with the Arl8b-kinesin machinery. To further 
support this notion, we show that mTOR antagonists can block outward movement of 
lysosomes in cells treated with acetate but have no effect in retrograde 
movement upon acetate removal. Overall our work provides tantalizing evidence 
that mTOR plays a role in controlling lysosome morphology and trafficking by 
modulating microtubule-based motor activity in leukocytes.","© 2016 Saric et al. This article is distributed by The American Society for Cell

driven to adopt M1 and M2 phenotypes. Recently, the distinct functions of M1 and 
M2 microglia have been intensively studied. M1-activation microglia are 
pro-inflammatory and may contribute to the development of several CSN disorders, 
while M2-activation microglia are anti-inflammatory and may promote tissue 
reconstruction. TRAM1 is a protein involved in translocation of nascent 
polypeptides and functions as a sorting adaptor of TLR4. Here, we found that 
TRAM1 plays an important role in microglia M1 polarization. Our results showed 
that the expression of TRAM1 is highly induced in LPS/interferon 
(IFN)-γ-stimulated BV2 cells and primary microglia cells. Flag-TRAM1 
transfection, but not Flag-GFP used as a control, significantly enhanced M1 
polarization by strongly increasing expression of M1 makers, such as IL-6, 
IL-1β, iNOS, and so on. Silence of TRAM1 effectively inhibited LPS/IFN-γ-induced 
expression of M1-related genes in BV2 cells. In addition, TRAM1 was found to 
cooperate with TLR4 to induce an M1 genetic program in Flag-TRAM1-transfected 
and LPS/IFN-γ-induced BV2 cells. TRAM1 is essential for LPS/IFN-γ induced 
expressions of adapter molecule (IRAK1, phosphorylation of TBK1, and IRF3) of 
TLR4. TRAM1 is also essential for phosphorylation of IκB and P65 and for 
P65-NF-kB translocation to nucleus. Overall, our findings showed that TRAM1 
could promote microglia M1 polarization.","DOI: 10.1007/s12031-015-0678-3

signaling pathways, which influence Th cell differentiation. In this study, we 
show that IRAK1 promotes Th17 development by mediating IL-1β-induced 
upregulation of IL-23R and subsequent STAT3 phosphorylation, thus enabling 
sustained IL-17 production. Moreover, we show that IRAK1 signaling fosters Th1 
differentiation by mediating T-bet induction and counteracts regulatory T cell 
generation. Cotransfer experiments revealed that Irak1-deficient CD4(+) T cells 
have a cell-intrinsic defect in generating Th1 and Th17 cells under inflammatory 
conditions in spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and colon tissue. Furthermore, 
IRAK1 expression in T cells was shown to be essential for T cell accumulation in 
the inflamed intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes. Transcriptome analysis ex 
vivo revealed that IRAK1 promotes T cell activation and induction of gut-homing 
molecules in a cell-intrinsic manner. Accordingly, Irak1-deficient T cells 
failed to upregulate surface expression of α4β7 integrin after transfer into 
Rag1(-/-) mice, and their ability to induce colitis was greatly impaired. Lack 
of IRAK1 in recipient mice provided additional protection from colitis. 
Therefore, IRAK1 plays an important role in intestinal inflammation by mediating 
T cell activation, differentiation, and accumulation in the gut. Thus, IRAK1 is 
a promising novel target for therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases.","Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1501874

HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Relevant cellular 
and molecular mechanism(s) controlled by DEK in HNSCC remain poorly understood. 
While DEK is known to regulate specific transcriptional targets, global 
DEK-dependent gene networks in HNSCC are unknown. To identify DEK 
transcriptional signatures we performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) in HNSCC cell 
lines that were either proficient or deficient for DEK. Bioinformatic analyses 
and subsequent validation revealed that IRAK1, a regulator of inflammatory 
signaling, and IRAK1-dependent regulatory networks were significantly repressed 
upon DEK knockdown in HNSCC. According to TCGA data, 14% of HNSCC specimens 
overexpressed IRAK1, thus supporting possible oncogenic functions. Furthermore, 
genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of IRAK1 in HNSCC cell lines was sufficient 
to attenuate downstream signaling such as ERK1/2 and to induce HNSCC cell death 
by apoptosis. Finally, targeting DEK and IRAK1 simultaneously enhanced cell 
death as compared to targeting either alone. Our findings reveal that IRAK1 
promotes cell survival and is an attractive therapeutic target in HNSCC cells. 
Thus, we propose a model wherein IRAK1 stimulates tumor signaling and phenotypes 
both independently and in conjunction with DEK.","DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.6028

promoting lipid accumulation and pro-inflammatory effects in vascular smooth 
muscle cells (VSMCs), which facilitate atherosclerosis development and 
progression. Previous studies have demonstrated that excess lipid accumulation 
in VSMCs is due to an inhibition of the expression of ATP-binding cassette 
transporter A1 (ABCA1), an important molecular mediator of lipid efflux from 
VSMCs. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this process are unclear. 
The purpose of this study was to disclose the underlying molecular mechanisms of 
TLR4 signaling in regulating ABCA1 expression. Primary cultured VSMCs were 
stimulated with 50 μg/ml oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). We determined 
that enhancing TLR4 signaling using oxLDL significantly downregulated ABCA1 
expression and induced lipid accumulation in VSMCs. However, TLR4 knockout 
significantly rescued oxLDL-induced ABCA1 downregulation and lipid accumulation. 
In addition, IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) was involved in the effects of 
TLR4 signaling on ABCA1 expression and lipid accumulation. Silencing IRAK1 
expression using a specific siRNA reversed TLR4-induced ABCA1 downregulation and 
lipid accumulation in vitro. These results were further confirmed by our in vivo 
experiments. We determined that enhancing TLR4 signaling by administering a 
12-week-long high-fat diet (HFD) to mice significantly increased IRAK1 
expression, which downregulated ABCA1 expression and induced lipid accumulation. 
In addition, TLR4 knockout in vivo reversed the effects of the HFD on IRAK1 and 
ABCA1 expression, as well as on lipid accumulation. In conclusion, IRAK1 is 
involved in TLR4-mediated downregulation of ABCA1 expression and lipid 
accumulation in VSMCs.","DOI: 10.1038/cddis.2015.212

of breast cancer clinical management. Here we report that interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is overexpressed in a subset of breast 
cancers, in particular triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it acts to 
drive aggressive growth, metastasis and acquired resistance to paclitaxel 
treatment. We show that IRAK1 overexpression confers TNBC growth advantage 
through NF-κB-related cytokine secretion and metastatic TNBC cells exhibit gain 
of IRAK1 dependency, resulting in high susceptibility to genetic and 
pharmacologic inhibition of IRAK1. Importantly, paclitaxel treatment induces 
strong IRAK1 phosphorylation, an increase in inflammatory cytokine expression, 
enrichment of cancer stem cells and acquired resistance to paclitaxel treatment. 
Pharmacologic inhibition of IRAK1 is able to reverse paclitaxel resistance by 
triggering massive apoptosis at least in part through inhibiting p38-MCL1 
pro-survival pathway. Our study thus demonstrates IRAK1 as a promising 
therapeutic target for TNBC metastasis and paclitaxel resistance.","DOI: 10.1038/ncomms9746

MAPKKK family protein in interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 
and Toll-like receptor signaling. This study was undertaken to examine the 
posttranslational modification of TAK1 and its therapeutic regulation in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: The effect of TAK1, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1), and TNF 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) inhibition was evaluated in 
IL-1β-stimulated human RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). Western blotting, 
immunoprecipitation, and 20S proteasome assay were used to study the 
ubiquitination process in RASFs. The efficacy of epigallocatechin-3-gallate 
(EGCG), a potent antiinflammatory molecule, in regulating these processes in 
RASFs was evaluated. Molecular docking was performed to examine the interaction 
of EGCG with human TAK1, IRAK-1, and TRAF6. These findings were confirmed using 
a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA).
RESULTS: Inhibition of TAK1, but not IRAK-1 or TRAF6, completely abrogated 
IL-1β-induced IL-6 and IL-8 synthesis in RASFs. EGCG inhibited TAK1 
phosphorylation at Thr(184/187) and occupied the C(174) position, an ATP-binding 
site, to inhibit its kinase activity. EGCG pretreatment also inhibited K(63) 
-linked autoubiquitination of TRAF6, a posttranslational modification essential 
for TAK1 autophosphorylation, by forming a stable H bond at the K(124) position 
on TRAF6. Furthermore, EGCG enhanced proteasome-associated deubiquitinase 
expression to rescue proteins from proteasomal degradation. Western blot 
analyses of joint homogenates from rats with AIA showed a significant increase 
in K(48) -linked polyubiquitination, TAK1 phosphorylation, and TRAF6 expression 
when compared to naive rats. Administration of EGCG (50 mg/kg/day) for 10 days 
ameliorated AIA in rats by reducing TAK1 phosphorylation and K(48) -linked 
polyubiquitination.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a rationale for targeting TAK1 for the 
treatment of RA with EGCG.","© 2015, American College of Rheumatology.","DOI: 10.1002/art.39447

we investigated the biological activity of IL-36α and IL-36γ using human colonic 
subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs).
METHODS: The mRNA expression and the protein expression of target molecules in 
SEMFs were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, respectively. The intracellular signaling of IL-36 
cytokines was analyzed using Western blot analysis and small interfering RNAs 
(siRNAs) specific for MyD88 adaptor proteins (MyD88 and IRAK1) and NF-κB p65.
RESULTS: IL-36α and IL-36γ significantly enhanced the secretion of IL-6 and CXC 
chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8) by SEMFs. The combination of IL-36α/γ and 
IL-17A or of IL-36α/γ and tumor necrosis factor-α showed a synergistic effect on 
the induction of IL-6 and CXC chemokines. The mRNA expression of proinflammatory 
mediators induced by IL-36α and/or IL-36γ was significantly suppressed by 
transfection of siRNA for MyD88 or IRAK1. Both inhibitors of mitogen activated 
protein kinases and siRNAs specific for NF-κBp65 significantly reduced the

with specific telopodes. Our previous study evidenced that TCs differed from 
fibroblasts and stem cells at the aspect of gene expression profiles. The 
present study aims to search the characters and patterns of chromosome X genes 
of TC-specific or TC-dominated gene profiles and fingerprints, investigate the 
network of principle genes, and explore potential functional association.
METHODS: We compared gene expression profiles in chromosome X of pulmonary TCs 
with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), fibroblasts (Fb), alveolar type II cells 
(ATII), airway basal cells (ABC), proximal airway cells (PAC), CD8(+) T cells 
come from bronchial lymph nodes (T-BL), or CD8(+) T cells from lungs (T-L) by 
global analyses, and selected the genes which were consistently up or down 
regulated (>1 fold) in TCs compared to other cells as TC-specific genes. The 
functional and characteristic networks were identified and compared by 
bioinformatics tools.
RESULTS: We selected 31 chromosome X genes as the TC-specific or dominated 
genes, among which 8 up-regulated (Flna, Msn, Cfp, Col4a5, Mum1l1, Rnf128, Syn1, 
and Srpx2) and 23 down-regulated (Abcb7, Atf1, Ddx26b, Drp2, Fam122b, Gyk,

CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that gene expressions of chromosome X in TCs are 
different with those in other cells in the lung tissue. According to the 
selected TC-specific genes, we infer that pulmonary TCs function as modulators 
which may enhance cellular growth and migration, resist senescence, protect 
cells from external stress, regulate immune responses, participate in tissue 
remodeling and repair, regulate neural function, and promote vessel formation.","DOI: 10.1186/s12967-015-0669-8

postnatal morbidity. The genetic basis of altered immune responses underlying 
placental inflammation (PI) remains understudied. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the relationship among TLR signaling pathway polymorphisms and

METHODS: Prospective cohort study in infants involving cord blood collection and 
placental examination for PI. One hundred and fifty-nine infants enrolled in 
study out of which 28 were term (eight with PI) and 131 preterm (47 with PI). 
DNA from blood was genotyped for SNPs in TLR2, 4, 5, 9, NFKBI, NFKBIA, TIRAP,

RESULTS: While there were no differences in BW, GA, gender, race, and SPL among 
infants with or without PI, there was a higher incidence of PPROM, maternal 
smoking, drug use, and clinical chorioamnionitis among infants with PI. Out of 
nine TLR variants, only CT and/or TT genotypes of the TLR9 variant (rs352140)

Zn, 65 mg/kg of Mn, 11 mg/kg of Cu, and 1 mg/kg of Co, and additional Zn, Mn, 
and Co provided by sulfates), and a subset of calves (n=8/treatment) was used 
for blood immunometabolic marker and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) gene and 
miRNA expression analyses. Samples were collected at birth (before colostrum 
feeding), 1d (24 h after colostrum intake), and 7 and 21d of age. Data were 
analyzed as a factorial design with the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS. No 
differences were detected in BW, but maternal ORG tended to increase calf 
withers height. Calves from INO-fed cows had greater concentrations of blood 
glucose, GOT, paraoxonase, myeloperoxidase, and reactive oxygen metabolites. 
Antioxidant capacity also was greater in INO calves. The PMNL expression of 
toll-like receptor pathway genes indicated a pro-inflammatory state in INO 
calves, with greater expression of the inflammatory mediators MYD88, IRAK1, 
TRAF6, NFKB, and NFKBIA. The lower expression of miR-155 and miR-125b in ORG 
calves indicated the potential for maternal organic trace minerals in regulating 
the PMNL inflammatory response at least via alterations in mRNA and miRNA 
expression. Overall, these results indicate that maternal nutrition with organic 
trace minerals could alter the neonatal innate immune response at least in part 
via changes in gene and miRNA expression. Further studies involving inflammatory 
challenges during the neonatal period should be performed to determine the 
functional benefit of maternal organic trace minerals on the neonatal immune

increase correlated with body mass index (r = 0.45; P = 0.001) and fat 
percentage (r = 0.36; P = 0.01). In diabetics, IRAK-1 mRNA expression was also 
higher in obese as compared with lean subjects (P = 0.012). As also shown by 
immunohistochemistry/confocal microscopy in non-diabetics and by 
immunohistochemistry in diabetics, IRAK-1 protein expression was higher in obese 
than overweight and lean adipose tissues. IRAK-1 gene expression correlated 
positively/significantly with mRNAs of TNF-α (r = 0.46; P = 0.0008), IL-6 
(r = 0.30; P = 0.03) and IL-18 (r = 0.31; P = 0.028) in non-diabetics; and only 
with TNF-α (r = 0.32; P = 0.03) in diabetics. IRAK-1 expression also correlated 
positively/significantly with CD68 (r = 0.32; P = 0.02), CD11c (r = 0.30; 
P = 0.03), and CD163 (r = 0.43; P = 0.001) in non-diabetics; and only with CD163 
(r = 0.34; P = 0.02) in diabetics. IRAK-1 mRNA levels also correlated with 
plasma markers including CCL-5 (r = 0.39; P = 0.02), C-reactive protein 
(r = 0.48; P = 0.005), adiponectin (r = -0.36; P = 0.04), and triglycerides 
(r = 0.40; P = 0.02) in non-diabetics; and only with triglycerides (r = -0.36; 
P = 0.04) in diabetics. IRAK-1 expression related with TLR2 (r = 0.39; 
P = 0.007) and MyD88 (r = 0.36; P = 0.01) in non-diabetics; and MyD88 (r = 0.52; 
P = 0.0003) in diabetics.
CONCLUSIONS: The elevated IRAK-1 expression in obese adipose tissue showed 
consensus with local/circulatory inflammatory signatures and represented as a 
tissue marker for metabolic inflammation. The data have clinical significance as 
interventions causing IRAK-1 suppression may alleviate meta-inflammation in 
obesity/T2D.","DOI: 10.1186/s13098-015-0067-7

(1)Institute of Cardiovascular Disease Research, Xuzhou Medical College.","AIM: Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and IRAK4 play essential 
roles in the induction of inflammatory gene products. We aimed to investigate 
the effect of the inhibition of IRAK1 and IRAK4 kinase activities on neointimal 
formation in rats with carotid artery balloon injuries using the IRAK1/4 
inhibitor N-(2-Morpholinylethyl)-2-(3-nitrobenzoylamido)-benzimidazole, a 
cell-permeable benzimidazole compound.
METHODS: Wistar rats and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) isolated from the 
thoracic aortas were used. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated nuclear factor 
kappa B (NFκB) signaling pathway was revealed by microarrays analysis. In 
addition, the differential expression of the TLR4 pathway genes, including TLR4, 
IRAK1, IκBα, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), was confirmed by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical staining, elastic-van Gieson and 
Masson staining, 5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay, transwell migration assay and western blotting were also contributed for 
relevant detection.
RESULTS: The expression of TLR4 protein gradually increased at days 1, 3, 7, and 
21 after balloon injury compared with the uninjured group. The dual inhibition 
of IRAK1 and IRAK4 attenuated neointimal formation and fibrotic remodeling after 
injury in vivo and suppressed VSMC proliferation and migration in vitro. The 
production of mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β in injured 
arteries were also reduced by the inhibition of IRAK1 and IRAK4. The expression 
of NFκB p65- and F4/80-positive cells in inhibitor rats were fewer than those in 
control rats at day 7, while IRAK1 expression was markedly higher at day 3 in 
inhibitor rats. Furthermore, western blotting analysis revealed that the IRAK1/4 
inhibitor suppressed the IRAK1 and IRAK4 kinase activities and the activation of 
the TLR4-mediated NFκB pathway in vivo and in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that IRAK1/4 could serve as a potential 
therapeutic target to suppress neointimal formation in carotid arteries after 
balloon injury through the TLR4/NFκB signaling pathway.","DOI: 10.5551/jat.29421

Grand Dictionary (), a herbal formula (RL) consisting of Rosae Multiflorae 
Fructus (multiflora rose hips) and Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Japanese 
honeysuckle flowers) has traditionally been used in treating inflammatory 
disorders. RL was previously reported to inhibit the expression of various 
inflammatory mediators regulated by NF-κB and MAPKs that are components of the 
TLR4 signalling pathways.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to provide further justification for clinical 
application of RL in treating inflammatory disorders by further delineating the 
involvement of the TLR4 signalling cascades in the effects of RL on inflammatory 
mediators.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RL consisting of Rosae Multiflorae Fructus and Lonicerae 
Japonicae Flos (in 5:3 ratio) was extracted using absolute ethanol. We 
investigated the effect of RL on the production of cytokines and chemokines that 
are regulated by three key transcription factors of the TLR4 signalling pathways 
AP-1, NF-κB and IRF3 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells using the multiplex 
biometric immunoassay. Phosphorylation of AP-1, NF-κB, IRF3, IκB-α, IKKα/β, Akt, 
TAK1, TBK1, IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 were examined in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and 
THP-1 cells using Western blotting. Nuclear localizations of AP-1, NF-κB and 
IRF3 were also examined using Western blotting.
RESULTS: RL reduced the secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines regulated by transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB and IRF3. 
Phosphorylation and nuclear protein levels of these transcription factors were 
decreased by RL treatment. Moreover, RL inhibited the activation/phosphorylation 
of IκB-α, IKKα/β, TAK1, TBK1 and IRAK-1.
CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of the IRAK-1/TAK1 and TBK1/IRF3 signalling pathways 
was associated with the effect of RL on inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated 
RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells. This provides further pharmacological basis for the 
clinical application of RL in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.",Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2015.08.018

in genes belonging to the B-cell receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling 
pathways, thus pointing to their potential implication in the biology of the 
disease. However, limited data is available regarding the exact role of TLRs. We 
aimed at characterizing the expression pattern of TLRs in splenic marginal zone 
lymphoma cells and their functional impact on the activation, proliferation and 
viability of malignant cells in vitro. Cells expressed significant levels of 
TLR1, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 and TLR10 mRNA; TLR2 and TLR4 showed a low, 
variable pattern of expression among patients whereas TLR3 and TLR5 mRNAs were 
undetectable; mRNA specific for TLR signaling molecules and adapters was also 
expressed. At the protein level, TLR1, TLR6, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 were detected. 
Stimulation of TLR1/2, TLR2/6 and TLR9 with their respective ligands triggered 
the activation of IRAK kinases, MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, and the 
induction of CD86 and CD25 activation molecules, although in a heterogeneous 
manner among different patient samples. TLR-induced activation and cell 
viability were also inhibited by a specific IRAK1/4 inhibitor, thus strongly 
supporting the specific role of TLR signaling in these processes. Furthermore, 
TLR2/6 and TLR9 stimulation also significantly increased cell proliferation. In 
conclusion, we demonstrate that splenic marginal zone lymphoma cells are 
equipped with functional TLR and signaling molecules and that the stimulation of 
TLR1/2, TLR2/6 and TLR9 may play a role in regulating disease pathobiology, 
likely promoting the expansion of the neoplastic clone.",Copyright© Ferrata Storti Foundation.,"DOI: 10.3324/haematol.2014.119933

structures. However, the knowledge about the specificity of teleost Tlr factors 
for distinct pathogens is limited so far. We measured baseline expression 
profiles of 18 tlr genes and associated signaling factors in four 
immune-relevant tissues of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Intraperitoneal 
injection of a lethal dose of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida induced 
highly increased levels of cytokine mRNAs during a 72-hour postinfection (hpi) 
period. In contrast, only the fish-specific tlr22a2 and the downstream factor 
irak1 featured clearly increased transcript levels, while the mRNA 
concentrations of many other tlr genes decreased. Flow cytometry quantified cell 
trafficking after infection indicating a dramatic influx of myeloid cells into 
the peritoneum and a belated low level immigration of lymphoid cells. T and B 
lymphocytes were differentiated with RT-qPCR revealing that B lymphocytes 
emigrated from and T lymphocytes immigrated into head kidney. In conclusion, no 
specific TLR can be singled out as a dominant receptor for A. salmonicida. The 
recruitment of cellular factors of innate immunity rather than induced 
expression of pathogen receptors is hence of key importance for mounting a first 
immune defense against invading A. salmonicida.","DOI: 10.1155/2015/901015

(1)1 Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.","BACKGROUND: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) enables assessment and rehabilitation 
of marginal donor lungs before transplantation. We previously demonstrated that 
adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) agonism attenuates lung ischemia-reperfusion 
injury. The current study utilizes a novel murine EVLP model to test the 
hypothesis that A2AR agonist enhances EVLP-mediated rehabilitation of donation 
after circulatory death (DCD) lungs.
METHODS: Mice underwent euthanasia and 60 minutes warm ischemia, and lungs were 
flushed with Perfadex and underwent cold static preservation (CSP, 60 minutes). 
Three groups were studied: no EVLP (CSP), EVLP with Steen solution for 60 
minutes (EVLP), and EVLP with Steen solution supplemented with ATL1223, a 
selective A2AR agonist (EVLP + ATL1223). Lung function, wet/dry weight, 
cytokines and neutrophil numbers were measured. Microarrays were performed using 
the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array.
RESULTS: Ex vivo lung perfusion significantly improved lung function versus CSP, 
which was further, significantly improved by EVLP + ATL1223. Lung edema, 
cytokines, and neutrophil counts were reduced after EVLP and further, 
significantly reduced after EVLP + ATL1223. Gene array analysis revealed 
differential expression of 1594 genes after EVLP, which comprise canonical 
pathways involved in inflammation and innate immunity including IL-1, IL-8, 
IL-6, and IL-17 signaling. Several pathways were uniquely regulated by EVLP + 
ATL1223 including the downregulation of genes involved in IL-1 signaling, such 
as ADCY9, ECSIT, IRAK1, MAPK12, and TOLLIP.
CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo lung perfusion modulates proinflammatory genes and reduces 
pulmonary dysfunction, edema, and inflammation in DCD lungs, which are further 
reduced by A2AR agonism. This murine EVLP model provides a novel platform to 
study rehabilitative mechanisms of DCD lungs.","DOI: 10.1097/TP.0000000000000830

most studies of cardiac protein kinases derive from other systems, an approach 
that fails to account for specific kinases expressed in the heart and the 
contractile cardiomyocytes. We aimed to define the cardiomyocyte kinome (i.e. 
the protein kinases expressed in cardiomyocytes) and identify kinases with 
altered expression in human failing hearts.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression profiling (Affymetrix microarrays) detected >400 
protein kinase mRNAs in rat neonatal ventricular myocytes (NVMs) and/or adult 
ventricular myocytes (AVMs), 32 and 93 of which were significantly up-regulated 
or down-regulated (greater than two-fold), respectively, in AVMs. Data for AGC 
family members were validated by qPCR. Proteomics analysis identified >180 
cardiomyocyte protein kinases, with high relative expression of 
mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and other known cardiomyocyte kinases 
(e.g. CAMKs, cAMP-dependent protein kinase). Other kinases are poorly 
investigated (e.g. Slk, Stk24, Oxsr1). Expression of Akt1/2/3, BRaf, ERK1/2, 
Map2k1, Map3k8, Map4k4, MST1/3, p38-MAPK, PKCδ, Pkn2, Ripk1/2, Tnni3k, and Zak 
was confirmed by immunoblotting. Relative to total protein, Map3k8 and Tnni3k 
were up-regulated in AVMs vs. NVMs. Microarray data for human hearts 
demonstrated variation in kinome expression that may influence responses to 
kinase inhibitor therapies. Furthermore, some kinases were up-regulated (e.g. 
NRK, JAK2, STK38L) or down-regulated (e.g. MAP2K1, IRAK1, STK40) in human 
failing hearts.
CONCLUSION: This characterization of the spectrum of kinases expressed in 
cardiomyocytes and the heart (cardiomyocyte and cardiac kinomes) identified 
novel kinases, some of which are differentially expressed in failing human 
hearts and could serve as potential therapeutic targets.","Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

epilepsy often associated with drug-resistant seizures. Numerous studies suggest 
that neuroinflammatory processes are pathologic hallmarks of both experimental 
and human epilepsy. In particular, the interleukin (IL)-1β/IL-1 receptor type 1 
(R1) axis is activated in epileptogenic tissue, where it contributes 
significantly to the generation and recurrence of seizures in animal models. In 
this study, we investigated whether IL-1β affects the GABA-evoked currents 
(I(GABA)) in TLE tissue from humans. Given the limited availability of fresh 
human brain specimens, we used the ""microtransplantation"" method of injecting 
Xenopus oocytes with membranes from surgically resected hippocampal and cortical 
tissue from 21 patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis (HS), hippocampal 
tissue from five patients with TLE without HS, and autoptic and surgical brain 
specimens from 15 controls without epilepsy. We report the novel finding that 
pathophysiological concentrations of IL-1β decreased the I(GABA) amplitude by up 
to 30% in specimens from patients with TLE with or without HS, but not in 
control tissues. This effect was reproduced by patch-clamp recordings on neurons 
in entorhinal cortex slices from rats with chronic epilepsy, and was not 
observed in control slices. In TLE specimens from humans, the IL-1β effect was 
mediated by IL-1R1 and PKC. We also showed that IL-1R1 and IRAK1, the proximal 
kinase mediating the IL-1R1 signaling, are both up-regulated in the TLE compared 
with control specimens, thus supporting the idea that the IL-1β/IL-R1 axis is 
activated in human epilepsy. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism possibly 
underlying the ictogenic action of IL-1β, thus suggesting that this cytokine 
contributes to seizure generation in human TLE by reducing GABA-mediated 
neurotransmission.",Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.nbd.2015.07.003

Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRs) have a regulatory function in

expression of miR‑146a in plasma and ovarian granulosa cells obtained from 
patients with POF, its effect on the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells and 
the possible underlying mechanisms were examined. The present study demonstrated 
that compared with the control groups, the expression of miR‑146a in the plasma

upregulated. Furthermore, it was found that miR‑146a simultaneously targeted 
interleukin‑1 receptor‑associated kinase (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor

autoimmune diseases (ADs). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase-1 
(IRAK1) is a key mediator in infection immunity, while the gene of IRAK1 is 
recognized as a risk gene in ADs. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
in IRAK1 (rs3027898, rs1059702, rs1059703) are considered to be associated with 
ADs risk. However, the results are conflicting. We conducted this study to get 
more precise estimations.
METHODOLOGY: PubMed, OvidSP, and CNKI databases (published prior to August 2014) 
were searched, and data was extracted from eligible studies. The procedure of 
statistical analysis was performed using STATA 12.0 software. A random effect 
model or fixed effect model was chosen based on the between-study 
heterogeneities.
RESULTS: Of the studies involved, 11 studies included 10,705 cases (9,865 
controls) for rs3027898, 9 studies included 15,005 cases (14,997 controls) for 
rs1059702, and 7 studies included 8,115 cases (6,815 controls) for rs1059703. 
Overall, the results showed that there were significant associations with ADs 
risk in three genetic models for rs3027898 and in four genetic models for 
rs1059702, but in neither model for rs1059703. Moreover, in stratified analyses, 
different extents of associations were found in some different genetic models 
for all three SNPs.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that these three SNPs (rs3027898, rs1059702, 
rs1059703) in IRAK1 were associated with ADs risk.","DOI: 10.3855/jidc.6776

visceral leishmaniasis, escapes Toll-like receptor (TLR) dependent early host 
immune response by inducing the deubiquitinating enzyme A20, which is sustained 
up to 6 h postinfection only. Therefore, Leishmania must apply other means to 
deactivate late host responses. Here, we elucidated the role of IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase M (IRAK-M), a negative regulator of TLR signaling, in 
downregulating macrophage proinflammatory response during late hours of in vitro 
infection. Our data reveal a sharp decline in IRAK1 and IRAK4 phosphorylation at 
24 h postinfection along with markedly reduced association of IRAK1-TNF receptor 
associated factor 6, which is mandatory for TLR activation. In contrast, IRAK-M 
was induced after A20 levels decreased and reached a maximum at 24 h 
postinfection. IRAK-M induction coincided with increased stimulation of TGF-β, a 
hallmark cytokine of visceral infection. TGF-β-dependent signaling-mediated 
induction of SMAD family of proteins, 2, 3, and 4 plays important roles in 
transcriptional upregulation of IRAK-M. In infected macrophages, siRNA-mediated 
silencing of IRAK-M displayed enhanced IRAK1 and IRAK4 phosphorylation with a 
concomitant increase in downstream NF-κB activity and reduced parasite survival. 
Taken together, the results suggest that IRAK-M may be targeted by L. donovani 
to inhibit TLR-mediated proinflammatory response late during in vitro infection.","© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.","DOI: 10.1002/eji.201445336

(miRNAs) have recently been used as finger prints for sepsis, and have been 
validated to be potential sepsis biomarker recently. In the present study, we 
investigated the level of several miRNAs, such as miR-15a, miR-16, miR-15b, and 
miR-223, which have been identified as a biomarker in adult sepsis, in neonatal

miR-15a/16 function on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory 
pathway, the mice macrophage RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected with

down-regulated the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Interleukin-1

difference in the LPS treated cells. And the suppression capability of 
miR-15a/16 on the expression of TLR-4 and IRAK-1 were evaluated by western blot. 
Thus, in present study, we identified miR-15a/16 as potential biomarker for the

ancestral species. This is exemplified by the discovery of the Toll-like

melanogaster. The TLR pathway is ubiquitous and controls sensitivity to 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in eukaryotes. There is, however, 
a marked absence of this pathway from the plathyhelminthes, with the exception 
of the Pellino protein family, which is present in a number of species from this

pathway that provides a priming signal (signal 1) necessary for activation of 
the inflammasome by a second potassium-depleting signal (signal 2). Here we show 
that TLR3 binding to dsRNA promotes post-translational inflammasome activation 
through intermediate and late TRIF/RIPK1/FADD-dependent pathways. Both pathways 
require the scaffolding but not the catalytic function of caspase-8 or RIPK1. 
Only the late pathway requires kinase competent RIPK3 and MLKL function. 
Mechanistically, FADD/caspase-8 scaffolding function provides a

pathway it helps the oligomerization of RIPK3, which together with MLKL provides 
both signal 1 and 2 for inflammasome assembly. Cytoplasmic dsRNA activates NLRP3 
independent of TRIF, RIPK1, RIPK3 or mitochondrial DRP1, but requires 
FADD/caspase-8 in wildtype macrophages to remove RIPK3 inhibition. Our study

important for hosts' defense against the pathogens. Moreover, it plays a crucial 
role to resolve the overwhelming inflammatory responses that can be harmful to 
the host. Polarization of macrophages/monocytes can be induced by 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMP-mediated 
monocyte/macrophage polarization is important during the infection, as pathogen 
can suppress host immune system by altering the polarization status of the 
macrophages/monocytes. OmpU, an outer membrane porin protein of Vibrio cholerae, 
possesses the ability to induce pro-inflammatory responses in 
monocytes/macrophages. It is also able to down-regulate the LPS-mediated 
activation of the monocytes/macrophages. Such observation leads us to believe 
that OmpU may induce a state that can be called as M1/M2-intermediate state. In 
the present study, we evaluated a set of M1 and M2 markers in RAW 264.7 murine 
macrophage cell line, and THP-1 human monocytic cell line, in response to the 
purified OmpU protein. We observed that OmpU, as a PAMP, induced M1-polarization 
by activating the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. OmpU induced 
formation of TLR1/TLR2-heterodimers. OmpU-mediated TLR-activation led to the 
MyD88 recruitment to the TLR1/TLR2 complex. MyD88, in turn, recruited IRAK1. 
Ultimately, OmpU-mediated signaling led to the activation and subsequent nuclear 
translocation of the NFκB p65 subunit. We also observed that blocking of the 
TLR1, TLR2, IRAK1, and NFκB affected OmpU-mediated production of M1-associated 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-6.",Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.imbio.2015.06.009

secretory phenotype (SASP), including growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, 
chemokines, and proteases. The SASP induces a chronic low-grade inflammation 
adjacent to cells and tissues, leading to degenerative diseases. The 
anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids was investigated on SASP expression in 
senescent fibroblasts. Effects of flavonoids on SASP expression such as IL-1α, 
IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, CXCL1, MCP-2 and MMP-3 and signaling molecules were 
examined in bleomycin-induced senescent BJ cells. In vivo activity of apigenin 
on SASP suppression was identified in the kidney of aged rats. Among the five 
naturally-occurring flavonoids initially tested, apigenin and kaempferol 
strongly inhibited the expression of SASP. These flavonoids inhibited NF-κB p65 
activity via the IRAK1/IκBα signaling pathway and expression of IκBζ. Blocking 
IκBζ expression especially reduced the expression of SASP. A structure-activity 
relationship study using some synthetic flavones demonstrated that hydroxyl 
substitutions at C-2',3',4',5 and 7 were important in inhibiting SASP 
production. Finally, these results were verified by results showing that the 
oral administration of apigenin significantly reduced elevated levels of SASP 
and IκBζ mRNA in the kidneys of aged rats. This study is the first to show that 
certain flavonoids are inhibitors of SASP production, partially related to NF-κB

demonstrated deficient TLR4-induced activation of IL-1 receptor-associated 
kinase (IRAK) 4, IRAK1, and TANK-binding kinase (TBK) 1 as critical hallmarks of 
endotoxin tolerance, but mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined 
the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino-1 in endotoxin tolerance and TLR 
signaling. LPS stimulation increased Pellino-1 mRNA and protein expression in 
macrophages from mice injected with saline and in medium-pretreated human 
monocytes, THP-1, and MonoMac-6 cells, whereas endotoxin tolerization abrogated 
LPS inducibility of Pellino-1. Overexpression of Pellino-1 in 293/TLR2 and 
293/TLR4/MD2 cells enhanced TLR2- and TLR4-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and

Pellino-1 ablation in THP-1 cells impaired induction of myeloid differentiation

addition, asparagine (Asn) plays an important role in immune function. We aimed 
to investigate whether Asn could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
liver damage. Forty-eight castrated barrows were allotted to four groups 
including: (1) non-challenged control; (2) LPS-challenged control; (3) LPS + 
0.5% Asn; and (4) LPS + 1.0% Asn. After 19 d feeding with control, 0.5 or 1.0% 
Asn diets, pigs were injected with LPS or saline. Blood and liver samples were 
obtained at 4 h (early stage) and 24 h (late stage) post-injection. Asn 
alleviated liver injury, indicated by reduced serum aspartate aminotransferase 
and alkaline phosphatase activities linearly and quadratically; it increased 
claudin-1 protein expression linearly and quadratically at 24 h, and less severe 
liver morphological impairment at 4 or 24 h. In addition, Asn decreased mRNA 
expression of TNF-α and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) linearly and quadratically 
at 4 h; it increased TNF-α mRNA expression, and HSP70 protein expression 
linearly and quadratically at 24 h. Moreover, Asn increased inducible NO 
synthase activity linearly and quadratically. Finally, Asn down-regulated the 
mRNA expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling molecules (TLR4, IL-1

mortality, conditioned by pneumococcus and host factors, such as Toll-like 
receptors and their Toll-IL1R common signaling pathway. The objectives of this 
study are (1) to correlate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in 
some Toll-IL1R signaling pathway proteins (IRAK1, IRAK4, IRAKM and MyD88) with 
SIPD by comparing patients versus healthy controls. (2) To determine whether 
these SNPs influence SIPD outcome.
METHODS: Case-control prospective observational study: 60 pediatric patients 
with IPD and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and 120 healthy 
volunteers. Well-known immunodeficiencies were excluded.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: SNPs genotypes and alleles. Other variables: demographic, 
previous infections, and clinical, analytical and microbiological evolution 
data.
RESULTS: We have detected significant disequilibrium of SNPs frequencies between 
SIPD patients and controls in rs1059701-CC (IRAK1; P = 0.0067), rs4251513-CC 
(IRAK4; P < 0.0001), rs1461567-T (IRAK4; P = 0.0158) and rs6853-AA (MyD88; P < 
0.0001). SIPD patients showed significant association between: leukocytosis > 
15,000/mmc and rs1059702-nonTT (IRAK1; P = 0.0460), pleuropneumonia and 
rs1624395-G (IRAKM; P = 0.0147), and rs1370128-C (IRAKM; P = 0.0055), sequelae,

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show an association between SNPs in 
IRAK1, IRAK4 and MyD88, and the presence of SIPD. Our data showed that some SNPs 
may lead to a higher risk of developing SIPD while other are related with the 
outcome in SIPD patients. Following PIRO score (predisposition, insult, 
response, organ dysfunction), identifying SNPs predisposing to infectious

arrested at specific stages of thymic development with the underlying genetic 
abnormality often determining the stage of maturation arrest. Although their 
outcome has been improved with current therapy, survival rates remain only 
around 50% at 5 years and patients may therefore benefit from specific targeted 
therapy. Interleukin receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a ubiquitously 
expressed serine/threonine kinase that mediates signaling downstream to 
Toll-like (TLR) and Interleukin-1 Receptors (IL1R). Our data demonstrated that 
IRAK1 is overexpressed in all subtypes of T-ALL, compared to normal human thymic 
subpopulations, and is functional in T-ALL cell lines. Genetic knock-down of 
IRAK1 led to apoptosis, cell cycle disruption, diminished proliferation and 
reversal of corticosteroid resistance in T-ALL cell lines. However, 
pharmacological inhibition of IRAK1 using a small molecule inhibitor 
(IRAK1/4-Inh) only partially reproduced the results of the genetic knock-down. 
Altogether, our data suggest that IRAK1 is a candidate therapeutic target in 
T-ALL and highlight the requirement of next generation IRAK1 inhibitors.","DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.4150

macrophages and plays a pivotal role in fighting against Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of 
Iprl on the expression of macrophage genes related to the anti-infection of Mtb. 
Design or methods: In the experimental and control groups, the macrophages were 
infected with Mycobacterium H37Ra, and then the related immune genes between two 
groups were detected using microarray assay. Real-time quantitative PCR was 
applied to detect the differences in the expression of three up-regulated genes 
detected by microarray assay and to verify the reliability of microarray assay.
RESULTS: The expression of Iprl up-regulated 11 genes related to macrophage 
anti-immunity involved TLRs signaling pathway including TLR2 and TLR4, Irak1, 
Traf7, Ifngr1 and Tnfrsfla. No significant difference was found in terms of the 
molecular expression involved in regulation of the adaptive immune response, 
such as IL-1 and IL-12. The results of real-time PCR were consistent with the 
findings of microarray assay.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Iprl gene probably promotes macrophage activity 
and enhances the ability of macrophages to fight against Mtb infection. The 
underlying mechanism may be achieved by up-regulating the expression levels of 
innate immunity genes, especially TLR2/TLR4 and signal transduction molecules, 
which is determined using microarray assay. All these findings offer the basis 
for subsequent study of the mechanisms of Ipr1 gene in host innate immunity 
against Mtb infection.","PMCID: PMC4443065

contributes to the high mortality of sepsis. Innate and inflammatory responses 
mediated by TLRs play a critical role in sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. 
MicroRNA-146 (miR-146) was first identified as a negative regulator in innate 
immune and inflammatory responses induced by LPS. This study examined whether 
miR-146a will have a protective effect on sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. 
Lentivirus-expressing miR-146a (LmiR-146a) or lentivirus-expressing scrambled 
miR (LmiR-control) was delivered into the myocardium via the right carotid 
artery. Seven days after transfection, mice were subjected to cecal ligation and 
puncture (CLP). Untransfected mice were also subjected to CLP-induced sepsis. 
Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography before and 6 h after CLP. In 
vitro studies showed that increased miR-146a levels suppress LPS-induced IκBα 
phosphorylation and inflammatory cytokine production in both H9C2 cardiomyocytes 
and J774 macrophages. In vivo transfection of LmiR-146a attenuated 
sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. The values for percent ejection fraction and 
percent fractional shortening in LmiR-146a-transfected CLP mice were 
significantly greater than in untransfected CLP control. LmiR-146a transfection 
prevented sepsis-induced NF-κB activity, suppressed IRAK and TRAF6 expression in 
the myocardium, and attenuated sepsis-induced inflammatory cytokine production 
in both plasma and peritoneal fluid. In addition, LmiR-146a transfection 
decreased sepsis-induced infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the 
myocardium. LmiR-146a can also transfect macrophages in the periphery. We 
conclude that miR-146a attenuates sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction by 
preventing NF-κB activation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and inflammatory 
cytokine production via targeting of IRAK and TRAF6 in both cardiomyocytes and 
inflammatory monocytic cells.","Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1403155

host cells. These cytokines provide the initial host defense mechanism. In this 
report, we demonstrate that TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, can be induced 
by hepatitis C virus (HCV) in its host cells in a biphasic manner. The initial 
induction of TNF-α by HCV was prompt and could be blocked by the antibody 
directed against the HCV E2 envelope protein and by chemicals that inhibit 
endocytosis, indicating the specificity of endocytic uptake of HCV in this 
induction. Further studies indicated that the induction of TNF-α was dependent 
on toll-like receptors 7 and 8 (TLR7/8) but not on other intracellular pattern 
recognition receptors. Consistently, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of the 
downstream effectors in the TLR7/8 signaling pathway including MyD88, IRAK1, 
TRAF6, TAK1 and p65 NF-κB suppressed the expression of TNF-α. The role of p65 
NF-κB in the induction of TNF-α via transcriptional up-regulation was further 
confirmed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. TNF-α induced by HCV could 
activate its own receptor TNFR1 on hepatocytes to suppress HCV replication. This 
suppressive effect of TNF-α on HCV was due to its role in supporting interferon 
signaling, as the suppression of its expression led to the loss of IFNAR2 and 
impaired interferon signaling and the induction of interferon-stimulated genes. 
In conclusion, our results indicate that hepatocytes can sense HCV infection via 
TLR7/8 to induce the expression of TNF-α, which inhibits HCV replication via an 
autocrine mechanism to support interferon signaling.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004937

in cancer research with great therapeutic potential. Here, we have performed an 
in vitro screening of the Diversity Set III of the DTP program from the NCI/NIH, 
comprising 1600 compounds. We have identified 
1,3-Dichloro-6-[(E)-((4-methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl] dibenzo(b,d) furan-2,7-diol 
(referred to as D11) to be a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase 
CK2. The D11 compound was tested against 354 eukaryotic protein kinases. By 
setting the threshold for inhibition to <2% remaining kinase activity, only 
DYRK1B, IRAK1 and PIM3 were inhibited to an extent as the tetrameric CK2 
holoenzyme and its catalytic subunits α and α'. The IC50 values for the CK2α and 
CK2α' were on average 1-2 nM in comparison to the DYRK1B, IRAK1 and PIM3 
kinases, which ranged from 18 to 49 nM. Cell permeability and efficacy of D11 
were tested with cells in culture. In MIA PaCa-2 cells (human pancreatic 
carcinoma cell line), the phosphorylation of the CK2 biomarker CDC37 at S13 was 
almost completely inhibited in the presence of D11. This was observed both under 
normoxia and hypoxia. In the case of the human non-small cell lung carcinoma 
cell line, H1299, increasing amounts of D11 led to an inhibition of 
S380/T382/383 phosphorylation in PTEN, another biomarker for CK2 activity.","DOI: 10.1007/s11010-015-2433-z

are just beginning to be uncovered. Using in silico approaches, we identified 
the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) innate immunity pathway as a possible target of 
HCMV miRNAs. Luciferase reporter assay screens further identified TLR2 as a 
target of HCMV miR-UL112-3p. TLR2 plays a major role in innate immune response 
by detecting both bacterial and viral ligands, including HCMV envelope proteins 
gB and gH. TLR2 activates a variety of signal transduction routes including the 
NFκB pathway. Furthermore, TLR2 plays an important role in controlling CMV 
infection both in humans and in mice. Immunoblot analysis of cells transfected 
with a miR-UL112-3p mimic revealed that endogenous TLR2 is down-regulated by 
miR-UL112-3p with similar efficiency as a TLR2-targeting siRNA (siTLR2). We next 
found that TLR2 protein level decreases at late times during HCMV infection and 
correlates with miR-UL112-3p accumulation in fibroblasts and monocytic THP1 
cells. Confirming direct miR-UL112-3p targeting, down-regulation of endogenous 
TLR2 was not observed in cells infected with HCMV mutants deficient in 
miR-UL112-3p expression, but transfection of miR-UL112-3p in these cells 
restored TLR2 down-regulation. Using a NFκB reporter cell line, we found that 
miR-UL112-3p transfection significantly inhibited NFκB-dependent luciferase 
activity with similar efficiency as siTLR2. Consistent with this observation, 
miR-UL112-3p transfection significantly reduced the expression of multiple 
cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8) upon stimulation with a TLR2 agonist. Finally, 
miR-UL112-3p transfection significantly inhibited the TLR2-induced 
post-translational activation of IRAK1, a kinase located in the upstream section 
of the TLR2/NFκB signaling axis. To our knowledge, this is the first identified 
mechanism of TLR2 modulation by HCMV and is the first report of functional 
targeting of TLR2 by a viral miRNA. These results provide a novel mechanism 
through which a HCMV miRNA regulates the innate immune response by 
down-regulating TLR-2 expression.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004881

have previously identified activated microglia/macrophage whey acidic protein 
(AMWAP) as a counter-regulator of pro-inflammatory response. Here, we studied 
its mechanisms of action with a focus on toll-like receptor (TLR) and nuclear 
factor κB (NFκB) signaling.
METHODS: Recombinant AMWAP was produced in Escherichia coli and HEK293 EBNA 
cells and purified by affinity chromatography. AMWAP uptake was identified by 
fluorescent labeling, and pro-inflammatory microglia markers were measured by 
qRT-PCR after stimulation with TLR ligands. NFκB pathway proteins were assessed 
by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation. A 20S proteasome 
activity assay was used to investigate the anti-peptidase activity of AMWAP. 
Microglial neurotoxicity was estimated by nitrite measurement and quantification 
of caspase 3/7 levels in 661W photoreceptors cultured in the presence of 
microglia-conditioned medium. Microglial proliferation was investigated using 
flow cytometry, and their phagocytosis was monitored by the uptake of 661W 
photoreceptor debris.
RESULTS: AMWAP was secreted from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia 
and recombinant AMWAP reduced gene transcription of IL6, iNOS, CCL2, CASP11, and 
TNFα in BV-2 microglia treated with LPS as TLR4 ligand. This effect was 
replicated with murine embryonic stem cell-derived microglia (ESdM) and primary 
brain microglia. AMWAP also diminished pro-inflammatory markers in microglia 
activated with the TLR2 ligand zymosan but had no effects on IL6, iNOS, and CCL2 
transcription in cells treated with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides as TLR9 ligand. 
Microglial uptake of AMWAP effectively inhibited TLR4-dependent NFκB activation 
by preventing IRAK-1 and IκBα proteolysis. No inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation 
or ubiquitination and no influence on overall 20S proteasome activity were 
observed. Functionally, both microglial nitric oxide (NO) secretion and 661W 
photoreceptor apoptosis were significantly reduced after AMWAP treatment. AMWAP 
promoted the filopodia formation of microglia and increased the phagocytic 
uptake of apoptotic 661W photoreceptor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: AMWAP is secreted from reactive microglia and acts in a paracrine 
fashion to counter-balance TLR2/TLR4-induced reactivity through NFκB inhibition. 
AMWAP also induces a neuroprotective microglial phenotype with reduced 
neurotoxicity and increased phagocytosis. We therefore hypothesize that 
anti-inflammatory whey acidic proteins could have a therapeutic potential in 
neurodegenerative diseases of the brain and the retina.","DOI: 10.1186/s12974-015-0296-6

in erosion of the surrounding bony structures with consequent hearing loss, 
vestibular dysfunction, facial paralysis, or intracranial complications. The 
etiopathogenesis of cholesteatoma is controversial but is associated with 
recurrent ear infections. The role of intracellular innate immune receptors, the 
NOD-like receptors, and their associated signaling networks was investigated in 
cholesteatoma, since mutations in NOD-like receptor-related genes have been 
implicated in other chronic inflammatory disorders. Results. The expression of 
NOD2 mRNA and protein was significantly induced in cholesteatoma compared to the 
external auditory canal skin, mainly located in the epithelial layer of 
cholesteatoma. Microarray analysis showed significant upregulation for NOD2, not 
for NOD1, TLR2, or TLR4 in cholesteatoma. Moreover, regulation of genes in an 
interaction network of the NOD-adaptor molecule RIPK2 was detected. In addition 
to NOD2, NLRC4, and PYCARD, the downstream molecules IRAK1 and antiapoptotic 
regulator CFLAR showed significant upregulation, whereas SMAD3, a proapoptotic 
inducer, was significantly downregulated. Finally, altered regulation of 
inflammatory target genes of NOD signaling was detected. Conclusions. These 
results indicate that the interaction of innate immune signaling mediated by 
NLRs and their downstream target molecules is involved in the etiopathogenesis 
and growth of cholesteatoma.","DOI: 10.1155/2015/408169

anti-inflammatory mode of action and its immunopharmacological target molecules. 
In this study, we explored anti-inflammatory activity of KF in LPS-treated 
macrophages. In particular, molecular targets for KF action were identified by 
using biochemical and molecular biological analyses. KF suppressed the release 
of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), downregulated the cellular 
adhesion of U937 cells to fibronectin (FN), neutralized the generation of 
radicals, and diminished mRNA expression levels of inflammatory genes encoding 
inducible NO synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, and cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 in 
lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) and sodium nitroprusside- (SNP-) treated RAW264.7 
cells and peritoneal macrophages. KF reduced NF-κB (p65 and p50) and AP-1 (c-Jun 
and c-Fos) levels in the nucleus and their transcriptional activity. 
Interestingly, it was found that Src, Syk, IRAK1, and IRAK4 responsible for 
NF-κB and AP-1 activation were identified as the direct molecular targets of KF 
by kinase enzyme assays and by measuring their phosphorylation patterns. KF was 
revealed to have in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity by the direct 
suppression of Src, Syk, IRAK1, and IRAK4, involved in the activation of NF-κB

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Stimulation of rat primary vascular smooth muscle cells 
with fetal bovine serum (10%) or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (20 ng/mL) 
for 15 minutes to 24 hours induced a time-dependent increase in IRAK1 and 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, proliferating cell 
nuclear antigen upregulation and p27Kip1 downregulation as assessed by Western 
blotting. Inhibitors of ERK pathway (U0126, 10 μmol/L), IRAK (IRAK1/4, 3 
μmol/L), protein kinase C (PKC; Ro-31-8220, 1 μmol/L), siRNA of toll-like 
receptor-4 (200 nmol/L), and PKC-ε (200 nmol/L) significantly attenuated these 
changes. Platelet-derived growth factor induced endogenous IRAK-ERK-PKC-ε 
association in a toll-like receptor-4 and PKC-ε-dependent manner. A 
time-dependent increase in IRAK1 and ERK activation was observed after 15 
minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours of carotid balloon 
injury in rats. Balloon injury induced endogenous IRAK-ERK-PKC-ε interaction. 
Perivascular application of IRAK1/4 inhibitor (100 μmol/L), U0126 (100 μmol/L), 
and IRAK1 siRNA (220 and 360 nmol/L) in pluronic gel abrogated balloon 
injury-induced ERK phosphorylation, activation, and p27Kip1 downregulation. 
Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry of proliferating cell

intimal thickening and neointimal vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation were 
significantly abrogated in the presence of IRAK1/4 inhibitor, IRAK1 siRNA, and

(1)Department of Oral Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fla., USA.","Unwarranted overproduction of cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, can cause 
moderate to severe pathological complications, and thus elaborate mechanisms are 
needed to regulate its onset and termination. One such, well-known, mechanism is 
endotoxin tolerance, generally described as controlling lipopolysaccharide 
Toll-like receptor 4 (LPS-TLR4) signaling. Similarly, cytokine-induced tolerance 
plays an important role in regulating an overactive cytokine response. In this 
report, the capability of IL-1β to induce tolerance and cross-tolerance to 
various inflammatory ligands was investigated. IL-1β-stimulated THP-1 monocytes 
showed a gradual increase of microRNA (miR)-146a, reaching 15-fold expression by 
24 h. miR-146a upregulation induced tolerance toward subsequent challenges of 
IL-1β, LPS, peptidoglycan, Pam and flagellin in THP-1 cells. The induction of 
tolerance was dependent on the IL-1β priming dose and associated increase of 
miR-146a expression. Moreover, IL-1β-treated THP-1 cells showed sustained 
miR-146a upregulation that repressed IRAK1 and TRAF6 adaptor molecules. 
Transfection of miR-146a alone mimicked IL-1β-induced tolerance in monocytes, 
while cells transfected with miR-146a inhibitor increased chemokine production. 
A comparable cytokine response regulated by miR-146a was also detected in lung 
epithelial A549 cells, purified human monocytes and mouse peritoneal 
macrophages. Thus, our studies showed that miR-146a was crucial for monocytic 
cell-based IL-1β tolerance and cross-tolerance, and thus opens the way for

encephalitis which is more prevalent in South and Southeast Asia. JEV is a 
neurotropic virus which infiltrates into the brain through vascular endothelial 
cells. JEV infects neurons and microglial cells which causes neuronal damage and 
inflammation. However, JEV also evades the cellular immune response to survive 
in host cells. Viruses are known to modulate the expression of microRNAs, which 
in turn modulate cellular immune response by targeting expression of antiviral 
genes. The aim of this study is to understand the anti-inflammatory role of 
miR-146a during JEV infection, which facilitates immune evasion.
METHODS: Human brain microglial cells (CHME3) were infected by JEV: JaOArS982 
and P20778 strain, and expression of miR-146a were analyzed. Overexpression and 
knockdown studies of miR-146a were done to see the effect on NF-κB pathway and 
antiviral Jak-STAT pathway. Regulatory role of miR-146a on expression of 
interferon-stimulated genes was determined by real-time PCR and luciferase 
assays.
RESULTS: JEV infection elevated the expression of miR-146a in JaOArS982 strain 
which caused downregulation of TRAF6, IRAK1, IRAK2, and STAT1 genes. Exogenous 
overexpression of miR-146a led to suppression of NF-κB activation and abrogation 
of Jak-STAT pathway upon JEV infection which led to downregulation of 
interferon-stimulated genes (IFIT-1 and IFIT-2) and facilitated viral 
replication. JEV infection initially upregulated cytokine production and 
activated STAT1 activity but STAT1 levels reduced at later time point, which led 
to the downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes.
CONCLUSION: Upregulation of miR-146a by JEV JaOArS982 strain leads to 
suppression of NF-κB activity and disruption of antiviral Jak-STAT signaling 
which helps the virus to evade the cellular immune response. This effect of JEV 
infection on miR-146a expression was found to be strain specific.","DOI: 10.1186/s12974-015-0249-0

tissues as controls. RNA was isolated from further fresh samples of OLP and 
non-specifically inflamed oral tissue controls (n = 6 for both groups) and used

responses in endothelial cells by activating toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
signalling. Here, we investigate the effects of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) on 
LPS-induced TLR4 signalling and the role of the miR-146 family of micro RNAs in 
the effects of Ang-1 on TRL4 signalling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Leucocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVECs) was detected using fluorescence microscopy. Adhesion molecule, 
pro-inflammatory cytokine, miR-146a, and miR-146b-5p expressions in HUVECs were 
quantified using real-time PCR. TLR4 signalling protein levels were measured 
using immunoblotting. Exposure of HUVECs to LPS for 4-6 h induces robust 
inflammatory responses, including enhanced leucocyte adhesion, up-regulation of 
adhesion molecule expression (VCAM1, ICAM1, E-SELECTIN), enhanced cytokine 
production (TNFα, IL1β, IL6, and IL8), and increased NFκB luciferase reporter 
activity. Addition of Ang-1 to the culture medium for 24 h prior to LPS exposure 
significantly attenuates these responses. Prolonged Ang-1 exposure significantly 
decreases IRAK1 and TRAF6 protein levels but has no effect on TLR4, MYD88, 
IRAK4, or TAK1 expressions. Ang-1 triggers significant up-regulation of 
miR-146b-5p levels but has no effect on miR-146a or miR-146b-3p expressions. 
Transfection of HUVECs with a miR-146b-5p mimic significantly attenuates 
LPS-induced inflammatory responses and IRAK1 and TRAF6 expressions. In HUVECs 
transfected with a miR-146b-5p inhibitor, Ang-1 has no effect on LPS-induced 
inflammatory responses or IRAK1 and TRAF6 expressions.
CONCLUSION: Ang-1 disrupts TLR4 signalling, resulting in inhibition of 
LPS-induced inflammatory responses in endothelial cells. This inhibition occurs 
through selective targeting of IRAK1 and TRAF6 proteins by miR-146b-5p.","Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

beta (IFNβ). Previous studies demonstrated that Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) 
deficient DCs exhibited a residual IFNα response to CpG-A, indicating that 
yet-unidentified molecules are also involved in induction of IFNα by CpG-A. 
Here, we report that the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase 
(DNA-PKcs) but not Ku70 deficient BMDCs showed defective IFNα and IFNβ responses 
to CpG-A or CpG-B. Loss of both DNA-PKcs and TLR9 further reduced the IFNα 
response to CpG-A. These DNA-PKcs and TLR9 effects were mediated by their 
downstream Akt/mTORC1 pathway and downstream events IRAK1 and IKKα. Loss of 
DNA-PKcs, TLR9, MyD88 or IRAK4 impaired phosphorylation of Akt(S473), S6K, S6, 
IRAK1, or IKKα in BMDCs in response to CpG-ODNs. The residual IFNα and IFNβ in 
DNA-PKcs-deficient BMDCs were partially responsible for the induction of IL-6

neutralizing antibodies. Further analysis indicated that CpG-ODN associated with 
DNA-PKcs and Ku70, and induced DNA-PKcs's interaction with TRAF3. Intriguingly,

treat jaundice, pneumonia, edema, fever, and several inflammatory diseases. 
Saucerneol D (SD), a lignan constituent of this plant, has antioxidant, 
anti-asthmatic, and anti-inflammatory activities. SD has been previously 
reported to inhibit the pro-inflammatory responses of RAW264.7 cells and primary 
mast cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of SD on the functions of 
dendritic cells (DCs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SD was isolated from methanol extract of the roots of S. 
chinensis. Bone marrow-derived DCs were used as target cells. The effects of SD 
on the following DC functions were examined: surface molecule expression, 
cytokine expression, migration, allogenic T cell activation, heme oxygenase-1 
expression, and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling.
RESULTS: In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated DCs, SD inhibited the expression of 
cell surface molecules (MHC I/II, CD40, CD80, and CD86), the production of 
inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide, IL-12, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and allogenic T 
cell activation capacity. SD also inhibited DC migration toward MIP-3β by 
down-regulating CCR7 expression. SD attenuated LPS-induced activation of NF-κB 
and MAPK signaling in DCs, but did not directly inhibit kinase activities of 
IRAK1, IRAK4, TAK1, or IKKβ in enzymatic assays. SD did not inhibit LPS binding 
to myeloid differentiation protein-2, co-receptor of TLR4. SD increased the 
production of reactive oxygen species, Nrf-2, and heme oxygenase (HO)-1, which 
degrades the heme to immunosuppressive carbon monoxide and biliverdin, which may 
underlie the anti-inflammatory effects in SD-treated DCs.

oxygenase (HO)-1 in protecting liver from warm ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) 
injury.
METHODS: Partial warm ischemia was produced in the left and middle hepatic lobes 
of SD rats for 75 min, followed by 6 h of reperfusion. Rats were treated with 
saline, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) or zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) at 24 h prior 
to the ischemia insult. Blood and samples of ischemic lobes subjected to 
ischemia were collected at 6 h after reperfusion. Serum transaminases level, 
plasma lactate dehydrogenase and myeloperoxidase activity in liver were 
measured. Liver histological injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were 
evaluated by tissue section and liver immunohistochemical analysis. We used 
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyze liver 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The cell lysates were 
subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Toll-IL-1R-containing adaptor 
inducing interferon-β (TRIF) and anti-myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), 
and then the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 
the indicated antibodies.
RESULTS: HO-1 protected livers from I/R injury, as evidenced by diminished liver 
enzymes and well-preserved tissue architecture. In comparison with ZnPP livers 6 
h after surgery, CoPP treatment livers showed a significant increase 
inflammatory cell infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils and 
macrophages. The Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and TANK binding kinase 1 protein 
levels of rats treated with CoPP significantly reduced in 
TRIF-immunoprecipitated complex, as compared with ZnPP treatment. In addition, 
pretreatment with CoPP reduced the expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, 
IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated 
factor 6 in MyD88-immunoprecipitated complex. The inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines mRNA expression rapidly decreased in CoPP-pretreated liver, compared 
with the ZnPP-treated group. However, the expression of negative regulators 
Toll-interacting protein, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1, IRAK-M and Src 
homology 2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase-1 in CoPP treatment rats 
were markedly up-regulated as compared with ZnPP-treated rats.
CONCLUSION: HO-1 protects liver against I/R injury by inhibiting 
TLR2/TLR4-triggered MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways and increasing 
expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling in rats.","DOI: 10.3748/wjg.v21.i10.2937

since they detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on a 
range of microbes, including viruses, leading to innate immune activation and 
orchestration of the adaptive immune response.
OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to discuss earlier evidence implicating TLRs 
I and II in the innate immune response to viruses, in the light of more recent 
clinical data demonstrating that TLRs are important for anti-viral immunity in 
humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed via accessing research 
articles from PakMediNet, Pubmed and Google Scholar with key words of Toll-like 
receptors I and II Regarding human viral pathogenesis. The valued information on 
the recent scientific horizons was subjected to critical analysis.
RESULTS: Comprehensive literature review illustrates important signaling 
pathways involved in TLR1/TLR2 mediated regulation of viral pathogenesis. TLRs 
mediated activation of apoptosis tends to contribute towards defense strategies 
utilized by innate immune response. Activation of antiviral TLR1-dependent 
signaling cascade would ultimately lead to activation of NF-kappa B which 
promotes antiviral responses via induction of specific genes. TLR1/TLR2 dimer 
generates intracellular signaling via IRAK4 mediated activation of IRAK1/2 which 
results in activation of NF-kappa B, p38 and JNK proteins in cytoplasm. NF- 
kappa B, p38 and JNK enter the nucleus thereby causing activation of various 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-18. 
Among the chronic HCV infection, the HCV core protein induces TNF-α and IL-10 
from the macrophages thereby causing reduction in release of interferon alpha. 
Abnormal TLR1/TLR2 signaling may contribute to the enhancement of 
infection-related morbidity and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: To date, a large number of viruses are proved to trigger innate 
immunity via TLRs, suggesting that these receptors are likely to be important in 
the outcome of viral infection. This suggestion is supported by the observation 
that many viruses have evolved mechanisms not only to evade the innate immune 
system, but also to subvert it for the benefit of the virus.","DOI: 10.5812/jjm.13348

they are the most important source of type I interferons (IFNs) upon viral 
infection. Phagocytosed RNA viruses and RNA virus-infected cells are detected by 
pDCs with the endosomal pattern recognition receptor (PRR) toll-like receptor 7 
(TLR7). We showed that replication of the yellow fever live vaccine YF-17D in 
human pDCs and pDC-like cell lines stimulated type I IFN production through 
RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), a member of the RIG-I-like receptor 
(RLR) family of cytosolic PRRs. Thus, human pDCs sense replicative viral RNA. In 
contrast, direct contact between pDCs and YF-17D-infected cells stimulated a 
TLR7-dependent, viral replication-independent production of type I IFN. We also 
showed that the RLR pathway was dampened by the activities of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4 (IRAK1 and IRAK4), which are downstream 
effectors of the TLR7 pathway, suggesting that both kinases play opposing roles 
downstream of specific PRRs. Together, these data suggest that a virus can

as an X-linked tumor suppressor. The tumor-suppressive activity of FOXP3 has 
been observed in tumor initiation, but its role during tumor progression remains 
controversial. Moreover, the mechanism of FOXP3-mediated tumor-suppressive 
activity remains largely unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
sequencing, we identified a series of potential FOXP3-targeted miRNAs in MCF7 
cells. Notably, FOXP3 significantly induced the expression of miR-146a/b. In 
vitro, FOXP3-induced miR-146a/b prevented tumor cell proliferation and enhanced 
apoptosis. Functional analyses in vitro and in vivo revealed that FOXP3-induced 
miR-146a/b negatively regulates NF-κB activation by inhibiting the expression of 
IRAK1 and TRAF6. In ChIP assays, FOXP3 directly bound the promoter region of 
miR-146a but not of miR-146b, and FOXP3 interacted directly with NF-κB p65 to 
regulate an miR-146-NF-κB negative feedback regulation loop in normal breast 
epithelial and tumor cells, as demonstrated with luciferase reporter assays. 
Although FOXP3 significantly inhibited breast tumor growth and migration in 
vitro and metastasis in vivo, FOXP3-induced miR-146a/b contributed only to the 
inhibition of breast tumor growth. These data suggest that miR-146a/b 
contributes to FOXP3-mediated tumor suppression during tumor growth by 
triggering apoptosis. The identification of a FOXP3-miR-146-NF-κB axis provides 
an underlying mechanism for disruption of miR-146 family member expression and

but the underlying mechanism still remains largely unknown. Here, we identified 
a FOXP3-microRNA-146 (miR-146)-NF-κB axis in vitro and in vivo in prostate 
cancer cells. We observed that FOXP3 dramatically induced the expression of 
miR-146a/b, which contributed to transcriptional inhibition of IRAK1 and TRAF6, 
in prostate cancer cell lines. Tissue-specific deletion of Foxp3 in mouse 
prostate caused a significant reduction of miR-146a and upregulation of NF-κB 
activation. In addition, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions were 
observed in miR-146a-mutant mice as well as in Foxp3-mutant mice. Notably, the 
NF-κB inhibitor bortezomib inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in 
prostate epithelial cells, attenuating prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 
formation in Foxp3-mutant mice. Our data suggest that the FOXP3-miR-146-NF-κB

to various types of cancer. However, no objective response was seen in a 
clinical trial with PS-341 as a single agent in non-small cell lung cancer. Its 
antitumor activity is limited by the simultaneously activated antiapoptosis 
pathway. Recently, PS-341-induced NF-κB activation via IκBα degradation has been 
suggested to be one of its antiapoptotic effects. In this study, we investigated 
the effects of a combined application of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 
inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) with PS-341 in lung 
cancer cells. Hsp90 inhibition with 17-AAG was effective in enhancing 
PS-341-induced lung cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo. 17-AAG pretreatment 
induced the degradation of upstream regulators of IκB, IL-1R-associated kinase-1 
(IRAK-1), and IκB kinases (IKKs), dose and time dependently, which resulted in 
blocking of PS-341-induced IκBα degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, 
transcriptional activity, and NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic gene expressions 
such as COX-2. The concentrations of 17-AAG used for combinatorial treatment 
with PS-341 did not change cell viability or the activity of proteasome complex. 
Moreover, 17-AAG pretreatment decreased the level of phsophorylated Akt at 
serine 473 residue and suppressed active Akt-dependent inactivation of glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β. 17-AAG mediated the dissociation of its client proteins 
(IRAK-1, IKKs, and Akt) from the Hsp90 complex. As a result, it induced 
degradation of target proteins. Our results suggest that the combination of 
17-AAG and PS-341 could be an effective anticancer therapy that overcomes the 
limited effects of PS-341.","DOI: 10.1165/rcmb.2014-0186OC

cohorts of patients with SSc. Analysis of longitudinal skin biopsies suggests 
that a patient's subset assignment is stable over 6-12 months. Genetically, SSc

performed a meta-analysis of these genome-wide gene expression datasets. We 
created a gene-gene interaction network of the conserved molecular features

common chronic liver diseases worldwide. In this study, we investigated the role 
of miR-146b in the Toll-like receptor-4 signaling pathway and high-fat diet 
(HFD)-induced NASH in vivo and in vitro.
METHODS: The effect of miR-146b on the expression of IL-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) 
in RAW264.7 cells and HepG2 was studied, and the effect of miR-146b on lipid 
accumulation in HepG2 was also studied in vitro. The levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, 
NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the histologic features and 
lipid accumulation in the livers of HFD-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) and an miR-146b-administered HFD mouse model, were studied in vivo.
RESULTS: After miR-146b administration, TRAF6 and IRAK1 mRNA and protein levels 
in macrophages after lipopolysaccharide administration and in HepG2 cells after 
oleic acid (OA) administration were significantly decreased in 146b group 
compared with control group (P < 0.001). The lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells 
exposed to OA was also decreased by inactivation of IRAK1 and TRAF6, then 
downregulation of the downstream molecules (NF-κB) and upregulation of the 
tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) level. In vivo, after 
administration of miR-146b, TRAF6 and IRAK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as 
TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein levels were decreased, and hematoxylin and eosin 
staining showed that the 146b group had low average adipose cell cross-sectional 
areas compared with control group.

which included 365 tumor and 30 normal lung tissues. We found that the 
expression of IRAK1 in lung cancer was significantly higher compared with that 
in normal lung tissues (P=0.002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
were generated to evaluate the power of IRAK1 to distinguish lung cancer from 
non-cancerous lung tissue. The area under curve (AUC) of ROC of IRAK1 was 0.643 
(95% CI 0.550~0.735, P=0.009). Additionally, IRAK1 expression was related to 
clinical TNM stage (r=0.241, P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (r=0.279, P < 
0.001) and tumor size (r=0.299, P < 0.001) in lung cancer. In the subgroup of 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the 
positive rates of IRAK1 were both higher than that in the normal lung tissues 
(P=0.003, P=0.002, respectively). Further spearman analysis showed that IRAK1

pregnancy ensures establishment of pregnancy. We hypothesized that this dialog 
involves exosomes, ovine endogenous jaagsiekte retroviruses (enJSRV) and 
toll-like receptors (TLR) which regulate the secretion of interferon tau (IFNT), 
the pregnancy recognition signal in ruminants. First, exosomes isolated from 
uterine flushings from cyclic and pregnant ewes were analyzed for exosomal 
content and uterine expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSC70). Then, conceptus 
trophectoderm cells (oTr1) treated with different doses of exosomes were 
analyzed for the expression of genes involved in TLR-mediated cell signaling. 
The results revealed that exosomes contain mRNAs for enJSRV-ENV, HSC70, 
interleukins, and interferon (IFN)-regulatory factors. Exosomal content of 
enJSRV-ENV mRNA and protein decreased from days 10 and 12 to day 16 of 
gestation, and uterine expression of HSC70 increased in pregnant ewes compared 
with cyclic ewes. The oTr1 cells proliferated and secreted IFNT in a 
dose-dependent manner in response to exosomes from cyclic ewes. The expression 
of CD14, CD68, IRAK1, TRAF6, IRF6, and IRF7 mRNAs that are key to TLR-mediated 
expression of type 1 IFNs was significantly influenced by day of pregnancy. This 
study demonstrated that exosomes are liberated into the uterine lumen during the 
estrous cycle and early pregnancy; however, in pregnant ewes, exosomes stimulate 
trophectoderm cells to proliferate and secrete IFNT coordinately with regulation 
of TLR-mediated cell signaling. These results support our hypothesis that free 
and/or exosomal enJSRV act on the trophectoderm via TLR to induce the secretion 
of IFNT in a manner similar to that for innate immune responses of macrophages

chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The pathogenesis of infections is 
multifactorial and includes hypogammaglobulinemia, conventional therapy with 
alkylating drugs, and recently, purine analogs and mAb-associated T cells. 
Patients without these risk factors also suffer from infections, although the 
mechanism remains unknown. In a cohort of 70 patients with CLL, we demonstrated 
that their monocytes were locked into a refractory state and were unable to 
mount a classic inflammatory response to pathogens. In addition, they exhibited 
the primary features of endotoxin tolerance, including low cytokine production, 
high phagocytic activity, and impaired Ag presentation. The involvement of 
miR-146a in this phenomenon was suspected. We found miR-146a target genes, such 
as IRAK1 and TRAF6, were manifestly downregulated. Our study provides a new 
explanation for infections in patients with CLL and describes a cross-tolerance 
between endotoxins and tumors.","Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402272

during human monocyte differentiation into immature dendritic cells (imDCs) and 
mature DCs (mDCs). However, their roles in DC differentiation and function 
remain largely elusive. Here, we report that microRNA (miR)-146a and miR-146b 
modulate DC apoptosis and cytokine production. Expression of miR-146a and 
miR-146b was significantly increased upon monocyte differentiation into imDCs 
and mDCs. Silencing of miR-146a and/or miR-146b in imDCs and mDCs significantly 
prevented DC apoptosis, whereas overexpressing miR-146a and/or miR-146b 
increased DC apoptosis. miR-146a and miR-146b expression in imDCs and mDCs was 
inversely correlated with TRAF6 and IRAK1 expression. Furthermore, siRNA 
silencing of TRAF6 and/or IRAK1 in imDCs and mDCs enhanced DC apoptosis. By 
contrast, lentivirus overexpression of TRAF6 and/or IRAK1 promoted DC survival. 
Moreover, silencing of miR-146a and miR-146b expression had little effect on DC 
maturation but enhanced IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNF-α production as well as IFN-γ 
production by IL-12p70-mediated activation of natural killer cells, whereas 
miR-146a and miR-146b overexpression in mDCs reduced cytokine production. 
Silencing of miR-146a and miR-146b in DCs also down-regulated NF-κB inhibitor 
IκBα and increased Bcl-2 expression. Our results identify a new negative 
feedback mechanism involving the miR-146a/b-TRAF6/IRAK1-NF-κB axis in promoting 
DC apoptosis.","© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M114.591420

critical roles as regulators of numerous pathways and biological processes 
including the immune response. Emerging as one of the most important miRNAs to 
orchestrate immune and inflammatory signaling, often through its recognized 
target genes, IRAK1 and TRAF6, is microRNA-146a (miR-146a). MiR-146a is one, of 
a small number of miRNAs, whose expression is strongly induced following 
challenge of cells with bacterial endotoxin, and prolonged expression has been 
linked to immune tolerance, implying that it acts as a fine-tuning mechanism to 
prevent an overstimulation of the inflammatory response. In other cells, 
miR-146a has been shown to play a role in the control of the differentiation of 
megakaryocytic and monocytic lineages, adaptive immunity, and cancer. In this 
review, we discuss the central role prescribed to miR-146a in innate immunity. 
We particularly focus on the role played by miR-146a in the regulation and 
signaling mediated by one of the main pattern recognition receptors, toll/IL-1 
receptors (TLRs). Additionally, we also discuss the role of miR-146a in several 
classes of autoimmune pathologies where this miRNA has been shown to be 
dysregulated, as well as its potential role in the pathobiology of 
neurodegenerative diseases.","DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00578

inflammation. This study aimed to assess the association between hearing 
impairment and polymorphisms of genes encoding cytokines deeply-committed to the 
inflammatory response and immune homeostasis in an elderly Japanese population. 
Data were collected in the Longitudinal Study of Aging surveyed biennially 
between 1997 and 2010. The participants without any missing information at 
baseline were 1,957 individuals, and the gross accumulated number of 8,675 
subjects (40-89 years of age) was analyzed. Two hearing impairment criteria were 
taken as the better ear pure-tone average (PTABE) greater than 25 dB and greater 
than 40 dB. We analyzed cumulative data using generalized estimating equations 
to investigate the effect of 9 polymorphisms, namely, tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) α, rs1800630; TNF receptor super family (TNFRSF) 1B, rs1061624; 
interleukin (IL)-1A, rs1800587; IL-1B, rs16944; IL-4R, rs1801275; IL-6, 
rs1800796; IL-10, rs1800872; IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), 
rs1059702; C reactive protein (CRP), rs1130864.
RESULTS: The odds ratios for the hearing impairment (PTABE >25 dB) risk under 
additive genetic model were significant in TNF-α rs1800630 and TNFRSF1B 
rs1061624, which were respectively 1.172 (confidence interval [CI]: 
1.005-1.367), 1.211 (CI: 1.053-1.392) in model after adjustment for possible 
confounders. Using the criterion of PTABE >40 dB as disabling hearing 
impairment, the association remains significant in TNFRSF1B rs1061624, but not 
in TNF-α rs1800630. No other polymorphisms showed a significant association.
CONCLUSIONS: The present population-based cohort study demonstrated that TNF-α 
rs1800630 and TNFRSF1B rs1061624 contributed to the incremental risk of hearing 
impairment in the elderly. TNF-α and TNF receptor interactions play a pivotal 
role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response, and also cause programmed 
cell death and cell proliferation. The present observation implied the 
signalling cascades of TNF were involved in ear aging.","DOI: 10.1186/s12979-014-0018-4

Among the various signaling pathways within cancer cells that can incite the 
expression of inflammatory molecules are those that activate IL-1 
receptor-associated kinases (IRAK). The IRAK family is comprised of four family 
members, IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-3 (also known as IRAK-M), and IRAK-4, which play 
important roles in both positively and negatively regulating the expression of 
inflammatory molecules. The wide array of inflammatory molecules that are 
expressed in response to IRAK signaling within the tumor microenvironment 
regulate the production of factors which promote tumor growth, metastasis, 
immune suppression, and chemotherapy resistance. Based on published reports we 
propose that dysregulated activation of the IRAK signaling pathway in cancer

as alternatives to antibiotic use is growing. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes 
(PMNL) play a vital role with regard to the innate immune response that affects 
severity or duration of mastitis. To our knowledge, effect of cold-pressed 
terpeneless Valencia orange oil (TCO) on bovine PMNL function has not been 
elucidated. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect 
of TCO on bovine blood PMNL chemotaxis and phagocytosis capabilities and the 
expression of genes involved in inflammatory response in vitro. 
Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated from jugular blood of 12 Holstein 
cows in mid-lactation and were incubated with 0.0 or 0.01% TCO for 120min at 
37°C and 5% CO2, and phagocytosis (2×10(6) PMNL) and chemotaxis (6×10(6) PMNL) 
assays were then performed in vitro. For gene expression, RNA was extracted from 
incubated PMNL (6×10(6) PMNL), and gene expression was analyzed using 
quantitative PCR. The supernatant was stored at -80°C for analysis of tumor 
necrosis factor-α. Data were analyzed using a general linear mixed model with 
cow and treatment (i.e., control or TCO) in the model statement. In vitro 
supplementation of 0.01% of TCO increased the chemotactic ability to IL-8 by 
47%; however, migration of PMNL to complement 5a was not altered. Treatment did 
not affect the production of tumor necrosis factor-α by PMNL. Expression of 
proinflammatory genes (i.e., SELL, TLR4, IRAK1, TRAF6, and LYZ) coding for 
proteins was not altered by incubation of PMNL with TCO. However, downregulation 
of TLR2 [fold change (FC=treatment/control)=-2.14], NFKBIA (FC=1.82), IL1B 
(FC=-2.16), TNFA (FC=-9.43), and SOD2 (FC=-1.57) was observed for PMNL incubated 
with TCO when compared with controls. Interestingly, expression of IL10, a 
well-known antiinflammatory cytokine, was also downregulated (FC=-3.78), whereas 
expression of IL8 (FC=1.93), a gene coding for the cytokine IL-8 known for its 
chemotactic function, tended to be upregulated in PMNL incubated with TCO. 
Incubation of PMNL with TCO enhanced PMNL chemotaxis in vitro. The expression of 
genes involved in the inflammatory response was primarily downregulated. Results 
showed that 0.01% TCO did not impair the function of PMNL in vitro. Future 
studies investigating the use of TCO as an alternative therapy for treatment of 
mastitis, including dose and duration, for cows during lactation are warranted.","Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Injection of D-GalN/LPS. To mimic endotoxin tolerance, male Sprague-Dawley rats 
were treated with low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg once a day intraperitoneally for 
consecutive five days) before subsequent injection of D-GalN/LPS. Rat survival 
was determined by survival rate. Liver injury was confirmed by serum biochemical 
and liver histopathological examination. Inflammatory cytokines were determined 
by ELISA and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) (P65), toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4)

Pretreatment of LPS significantly improved rat survival. Moreover, rats 
pretreated with LPS exhibited lower serum enzyme (ALT, AST and TBiL) level, 
lower production of inflammatory cytokines and more minor liver 
histopathological damage than rats without pretreatment of LPS. LPS pretreatment 
suppressed production of TLR4 and IRAK-1. LPS pretreatment also inhibited

AP736 on various inflammatory events such as nitric oxide (NO)/prostaglandin

LPS-induced morphological changes and FITC-dextran-induced phagocytic uptake. 
Furthermore, AP736 also downregulated the expression of multiple inflammatory

complex pathogenesis in which genes and environmental factors are involved. We 
aimed at analyzing previously identified loci associated with SLE or with other 
autoimmune and/or inflammatory disorders (STAT4, IL10, IL23R, IRAK1, PSORS1C1, 
HCP5, MIR146a, PTPN2, ERAP1, ATG16L1, IRGM) in a sample of Italian SLE patients 
in order to verify or confirm their possible involvement and relative 
contribution in the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred thirty-nine consecutive SLE patients and 278 
matched healthy controls were enrolled. Study protocol included complete 
physical examination, and clinical and laboratory data collection. Nineteen 
polymorphisms were genotyped by allelic discrimination assays. A case-control 
association study and a genotype-phenotype correlation were performed.
RESULTS: STAT4 was the most associated gene [P = 3 × 10(-7), OR = 2.13 (95% CI: 
1.59-2.85)]. IL10 confirmed its association with SLE [rs3024505: P = 0.02, OR = 
1.52 (95% CI: 1.07-2.16)]. We describe a novel significant association between 
HCP5 locus and SLE susceptibility [rs3099844: P = 0.01, OR = 2.06 (95% CI: 
1.18-3.6)]. The genotype/phenotype correlation analysis showed several 
associations including a higher risk to develop pericarditis with STAT4, and an 
association between HCP5 rs3099844 and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 and IL10 confirm their association with SLE. We found that 
some SNPs in PSORS1C1, ATG16L1, IL23R, PTPN2 and MIR146a genes can determine 
particular disease phenotypes. HCP5 rs3099844 is associated with SLE and with 
anti-Ro/SSA. This polymorphism has been previously found associated with cardiac 
manifestations of SLE, a condition related with anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Thus, 
our results may provide new insights into SLE pathogenesis.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0111991

    Cell Cycle. 2014;13(24):3785-6.","It has been postulated that there is a link between inflammation and cancer. 
Here we describe a role for cell-intrinsic toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2; which is 
involved in inflammatory response) signalling in normal intestinal and mammary 
epithelial cells and oncogenesis. The downstream effectors of TLR2 are expressed 
by normal intestinal and mammary epithelia, including the stem/progenitor cells. 
Deletion of MYD88 or TLR2 in the intestinal epithelium markedly reduces 
DSS-induced colitis regeneration and spontaneous tumour development in mice. 
Limiting dilution transplantations of breast epithelial cells devoid of TLR2 or 
MYD88 revealed a significant decrease in mammary repopulating unit frequency 
compared with the control. Inhibition of TLR2, its co-receptor CD14, or its 
downstream targets MYD88 and IRAK1 inhibits growth of human breast cancers in 
vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that inhibitors of the TLR2 pathway 
merit investigation as possible therapeutic and chemoprevention agents.","DOI: 10.1038/ncb3058

Oncoprotein Gankyrin, which mostly increases in HCC, plays a critical role in 
HCC development and metastasis. However, the exact mechanism of Gankyrin 
up-regulation in HCC remains unclear. A Gankyrin luciferase reporter was 
developed to screen a potential regulator for Gankyrin from a list of 
proinflammatory cytokines, and interleukin (IL)-1β was found as one of its 
activators. In clinical premalignant and malignant liver disease samples, 
enhanced IL-1β/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) signaling 
accompanied by increased Gankyrin was observed. Lower expression of Gankyrin and 
phospho-IRAK-1 are favorable prognostic markers for HCC. A similar correlation 
was observed in the diethylnitrosamine (DEN) model of rat hepatocarcinogenesis. 
The results from Gankyrin reporter activity, real-time polymerase chain 
reaction, or immunoblotting further confirmed the up-regulation of Gankyrin by 
IL-1β/IRAK-1 inflammatory signaling. Moreover, a series of Gankyrin's truncated 
reporters were constructed, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and 
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed to analyze the properties of 
Gankyrin promoter. Mechanistically, the core promoter of Gankyrin contains the 
binding site of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family members, which can recruit 
histone acetyltransferase coactivator E1A-binding protein p300 (p300) or 
CREB-binding protein (CBP) to promote Gankyrin transcription. Conversely, 
knockdown of NF-Y, p300, or CBP inhibits Gankyrin expression. IL-1β stimulation 
causes sequential phosphorylation of IRAK-1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and 
p300 and enhances recruitment of the p300/CBP/NF-Y complex to Gankyrin promoter. 
Inhibition of phospho-JNK impairs IL-1β/IRAK-1 signaling-mediated up-regulation 
of Gankyrin.
CONCLUSION: The finding of IL-1β/IRAK-1 signaling promoting Gankyrin expression 
through JNK and NF-Y/p300/CBP complex provides a fresh view on

RESULTS: Nine studies containing 1224 patients and 1841 controls were included 
in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed no association between 
inflammatory arthritis and the rs2910164 C allele of miR-146a (odds ratio,

(1)From the Division of Trauma and General Surgery, Department of Surgery, 
University of Pittsburgh, PA.","OBJECTIVE(S): Clinical research characterizing the mechanisms responsible for 
sex-based outcome differences postinjury remain conflicting. We sought to 
characterize an X chromosome-linked IRAK-1 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) 
polymorphism as an alternative mechanism responsible for sex differences 
postinjury. IRAK-1 is key intermediate in the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway 
thought to drive inflammation postinjury.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed over a 24-month period. 
Bluntly injured patients requiring intensive care unit admission were enrolled, 
whereas patients with isolated brain and spinal cord injuries were excluded. 
Outcomes of interest included multiple organ failure (MOF, Marshall MOD score > 
5) and mortality. Logistic regression was utilized to determine the independent 
risk of poor outcome associated with the IRAK-1 variant after controlling for 
important differences.
RESULTS: In an enrolled cohort of 321 patients, the IRAK-1 variant was common 
(12.5%). Patients with and without the variant were similar in age, injury 
severity, and 24hr blood transfusion. After controlling for important 
confounders, the IRAK1 variant was independently associated with more than 
eightfold (OR = 8.4, P = 0.005, 95% CI: 1.9-37.1) and 11-fold (OR = 11.8, P = 
0.037, 95% CI: 1.1-121) greater risk of MOF and mortality, respectively. These 
differences were most prominent in men, whereas women heterozygous for the 
variant demonstrated worse outcome in a dose-dependent fashion.
CONCLUSIONS: The IRAK1 polymorphism is a strong independent predictor of MOF and

Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: A critical role of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and its 
downstream mediators in the pathogenesis of small-for-size liver graft injury 
has been documented. Recently, the microRNA-146 (miR-146) was identified as a 
potent negative regulator of the TLR4 signalling pathway. In this study, the 
role of miR-146a and miR-146b in the attenuation of TLR-4 signalling and 
small-for-size liver graft injury was investigated.
METHODS: The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-146b during small-for-size 
liver graft injury were studied in vivo. In addition, the effects of miR-146a 
and miR-146b on the expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6 in the rat macrophage cell 
line NR8383 and rat liver kupffer cells were studied in vitro. The in vivo 
effect of miR-146a and miR-146b on small-for-size liver graft injury was studied 
by the tail vein injection of miR-146a mimics and miR-146b mimics.
RESULTS: The levels of miR-146a and miR-146b decreased with a small-for-size 
liver graft. MiR-146a and miR-146b inhibited IRAK1 and TRAF6 expression by 
binding to the 3'UTR of IRAK1 or TRAF6, respectively, in the rat macrophage cell 
line NR8383. The administration of miR-146a mimics and miR-146b mimics prevented 
liver graft injury in small-for-size liver graft injury via the inactivation of 
IRAK1 and TRAF6 in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-146a and miR-146b prevent liver injury in small-for-size liver 
graft injury via the inactivation of IRAK1 and TRAF6.",© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/liv.12674

affects mainly females. What role the X chromosome plays in the disease has 
always been an intriguing question. In this study, we examined the genetic 
variants on the X chromosome through meta-analysis of two genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) on SLE on Chinese Han populations. Prominent 
association signals from the meta-analysis were replicated in 4 additional Asian 
cohorts, with a total of 5373 cases and 9166 matched controls. We identified a 
novel variant in PRPS2 on Xp22.3 as associated with SLE with genome-wide 
significance (rs7062536, OR = 0.84, P = 1.00E-08). Association of the 
L1CAM-MECP2 region with SLE was reported previously. In this study, we 
identified independent contributors in this region in NAA10 (rs2071128, OR = 
0.81, P = 2.19E-13) and TMEM187 (rs17422, OR = 0.75, P = 1.47E-15), in addition 
to replicating the association from IRAK1-MECP2 region (rs1059702, OR = 0.71, P 
= 2.40E-18) in Asian cohorts. The X-linked susceptibility variants showed higher 
effect size in males than that in females, similar to results from a genome-wide 
survey of associated SNPs on the autosomes. These results suggest that 
susceptibility genes identified on the X chromosome, while contributing to 
disease predisposition, might not contribute significantly to the female 
predominance of this prototype autoimmune disease.","© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

adjuvant properties to a known allergen ovalbumin (OVA) in Balb/c mice. 
Therefore, in this study, we focused on the mechanisms involved in adjuvant 
responses induced by ZnO NPs. The eosinophil counts in the Peyers' patches of 
intestine and ICAM-1, Cox2 protein expressions were enhanced in the ZnO NPs/OVA 
group. Following screening of toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR 2, 4 and 6 were 
found to be increased. Accordingly, we found that downstream proteins of TLRs 
such as myeloid differentiation primary response protein-88 (MyD88), IL-1 
receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK 1), and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF 6) 
were also found to be enhanced in the ZnO NPs/OVA-induced group. These 
inflammatory responses underlined the critical roles of TLRs in the inflammatory 
response. ZnO NPs increased the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and 
protein expression of several mediators, including Cox2, PGE2, MMP-9 and finally 
caspase 1 in macrophages. Another pathway for adjuvant effect is Src which was 
found to be significantly affected by the activation of p-Lyn, p-Syk, IP3, 
p-PLC-γ and cAMP. Ca(2+) influx was significantly increased as well in the ZnO 
NPs/OVA group. These findings demonstrated the differential role of TLRs in 
regulation of the ZnO NPs-induced adjuvant responses causing the inflammation. 
We therefore, conclude that ZnO NPs have significant adjuvant effect via 
following Src kinase and TLRs signaling that ascribed to inflammatory responses 
due to recruitment and activation of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cells. 
The adjuvant property of ZnO NPs may help in planning strategies for its 
therapeutic use.",Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2014.08.008

(1)Laboratory of Neurovirology and Inflammation Biology, CSIR-Centre for 
Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, India.","OBJECTIVES: Chikungunya virus causes chronic infection with manifestations of 
joint pain. Human synovial fibroblasts get infected with CHIKV and could lead to 
pro-inflammatory responses. MicroRNAs have potentials to regulate the gene 
expression of various anti-viral and pro-inflammatory genes. The study aims to 
investigate the role of miR-146a in modulation of inflammatory responses of 
human synovial fibroblasts by Chikungunya virus.
METHODS: To study the role of miR-146a in CHIKV pathogenesis in human synovial 
cells and underlying inflammatory manifestations, we performed CHIKV infection 
in primary human synovial fibroblasts. Western blotting, real-time PCR, 
luciferase reporter assay, overexpression and knockdown of cellular miR-146a 
strategies have been employed to validate the role of miR-146a in regulation of 
pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway.
RESULTS: CHIKV infection induced the expression of cellular miR-146a, which 
resulted into down-regulation of TRAF6, IRAK1, IRAK2 and increased replication 
of CHIKV in human synovial fibroblasts. Exogenous expression of miR-146a in 
human synovial fibroblasts led to decreased expression of TRAF6, IRAK1, IRAK2 
and decreased replication of CHIKV. Inhibition of cellular miR-146a by 
anti-miR-146a restored the expression levels of TRAF6, IRAK1 and IRAK2. 
Downregulation of TRAF6, IRAK1 and IRAK2 led to downstream decreased NF-κB 
activation through negative feedback loop.

miR-146a by CHIKV in modulating the host antiviral immune response in primary

Chlamydophila psittaci (Cp) infection status and the response to doxycycline 
treatment in Korean patients with ocular adnexal extranodal marginal zone B-cell 
lymphoma (EMZL).
METHODS: Twelve ocular adnexal EMZL cases were classified into two groups (six 
Cp-positive cases and six Cp-negative cases). Among the 12 cases, eight were 
treated with doxycycline as first-line therapy, and they were divided into two 
groups according to their response to the treatment (four doxy-responders and 
four doxy-nonresponders). The differences in the DNA methylation states of 
27,578 methylation sites in 14,000 genes were evaluated using Illumina bead 
assay technology. We also validated the top-ranking differentially methylated 
genes (DMGs) with bisulfite direct sequencing or pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: The Infinium methylation chip assay revealed 180 DMGs in the 
Cp-positive group (74 hypermethylated genes and 106 hypomethylated genes) 
compared to the Cp-negative group. Among the 180 DMGs, DUSP22, which had two 
significantly hypomethylated loci, was validated, and the correlation was 
significant for one CpG site (Spearman coefficient=0.6478, p=0.0262). Regarding 
the response to doxycycline treatment, a total of 778 DMGs were revealed (389 
hypermethylated genes and 336 hypomethylated genes in the doxy-responder group). 
In a subsequent replication study for representative hypomethylated (IRAK1) and 
hypermethylated (CXCL6) genes, the correlation between the bead chip analysis 
and pyrosequencing was significant (Spearman coefficient=0.8961 and 0.7619, 
respectively, p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Ocular adnexal EMZL showed distinct methylation patterns according 
to Cp infection and the response to doxycycline treatment in this genome-wide 
methylation study. Among the candidate genes, DUSP22 has a methylation status 
that was likely attributable to Cp infection. Our data also suggest that the 
methylation statuses of IRAK1 and CXCL6 may reflect the response to doxycycline 
treatment.","PMCID: PMC4105114

equal exposure to major risk factors, such as hepatitis B or C virus infection. 
Female resistance is hormone-dependent, as evidenced by the sharp increase in 
HCC incidence in postmenopausal women who do not take hormone replacement 
therapy. In rodent models sex-dimorphic HCC phenotypes are pituitary-dependent, 
suggesting that sex hormones act via the gonadal-hypophyseal axis. We found that 
the estrogen-responsive pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL), signaling through 
hepatocyte-predominant short-form prolactin receptors (PRLR-S), constrained TNF 
receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-dependent innate immune responses invoked by 
IL-1β, TNF-α, and LPS/Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), but not TRIF-dependent

activation of c-Myc-interacting pathways, including PI3K/AKT, mTORC1, p38 MAPK, 
and NF-κB. Consistent with this finding, we documented exaggerated male liver 
responses to immune stimuli in mice and humans. Tumor promotion through, but 
regulation above, the level of c-Myc was demonstrated by sex-independent HCC 
eruption in Alb-Myc transgenic mice. PRL deficiency accelerated liver 
carcinogenesis in Prl(-/-) mice of both sexes. Conversely, pharmacologic PRL 
mobilization using the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist domperidone prevented HCC 
in tumor-prone C3H/HeN males. Viewed together, our results demonstrate that PRL 
constrains tumor-promoting liver inflammation by inhibiting MAP3K-dependent 
activation of c-Myc at the level of the trafasome. PRL-targeted therapy may hold 
promise for reducing the burden of liver cancer in high-risk men and women.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1404267111

Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine , 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.","The four mammalian Pellinos (Pellinos 1, 2, 3a, and 3b) are E3 ubiquitin ligases 
that are emerging as critical mediators for a variety of immune signaling 
pathways, including those activated by Toll-like receptors, the T-cell receptor, 
and NOD2. It is becoming increasingly clear that each Pellino has a distinct 
role in facilitating immune receptor signaling. However, the underlying 
mechanisms by which these highly homologous proteins act selectively in these 
signaling pathways are not clear. In this study, we investigate whether Pellino 
substrate recognition contributes to the divergent functions of Pellinos. 
Substrate recognition of each Pellino is mediated by its noncanonical 
forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a well-characterized phosphothreonine-binding 
module. Pellino FHA domains share very high sequence identity, so a molecular 
basis for differences in substrate recognition is not immediately apparent. To 
explore Pellino substrate specificity, we first identify a high-affinity 
Pellino2 FHA domain-binding motif in the Pellino substrate, interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1). Analysis of binding of the different 
Pellinos to a panel of phosphothreonine-containing peptides derived from the 
IRAK1-binding motif reveals that each Pellino has a distinct phosphothreonine 
peptide binding preference. We observe a similar binding specificity in the 
interaction of Pellinos with a number of known Pellino substrates. These results 
argue that the nonredundant roles that Pellinos play in immune signaling are in 
part due to their divergent substrate specificities. This new insight into 
Pellino substrate recognition could be exploited for pharmacological advantage 
in treating inflammatory diseases that have been linked to the aberrant 
regulation of Pellinos.","DOI: 10.1021/bi5005156

including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1(IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor 
receptor- associated factor 6(TRAF6), in the pathogenesis of liver 
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has been documented. Recently a microRNA, 
miR-146a, was identified as a potent negative regulator of the TLR signaling 
pathway. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-146a to attenuate TLR 
signaling and liver I/R injury in vivo and in vitro. miR-146a was decreased in 
mice Kupffer cells following hepatic I/R, whereas IRAK1 and TRAF6 increased. 
Overexpression of miR-146a directly decreased IRAK1 and TRAF6 expression and 
attenuated the release of proinflammatory cytokines through the inactivation of 
NF-κB P65 in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced macrophages, RAW264.7 cells. 
Knockdown experiments demonstrated that IRAK1 and TRAF6 are two potential 
targets for reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, 
co-culture assays indicated that miR-146a decreases the apoptosis of hepatocytes 
after H/R. In vivo administration of Ago-miR-146a, a stable version of miR-146a 
in vivo, protected against liver injury in mice after I/R via inactivation of 
the TLR signaling pathway. We conclude that miR-146a ameliorates liver

we investigated effect of mangiferin on 2,3,4-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid 
(TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and its anti-inflammatory mechanism in 
lipolysaccharide (LPS)- or peptidoglycan-stimulated mouse peritoneal 
macrophages. Mangiferin inhibited phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB 
(NF-κB), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and 
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in peptidoglycan- or LPS-stimulated 
peritoneal macrophages. Mangiferin in the presence of SN50 inhibited 
LPS-stimulated NF-κB activation more potently than mangiferin alone. Mangiferin 
inhibited interaction of fluorescent p-IRAK1 antibody to LPS-stimulated 
peritoneal macrophages, but increased binding of fluorescent IRAK1 antibody. 
Mangiferin did not influence interaction of fluorescent LPS to toll-like 
receptor-4 on the macrophages. Molecular peak of mangiferin bound to IRAK1 was 
detected in the macrophages by mass analysis. Mangiferin (10 μM) inhibited 
LPS-stimulated expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 by 81.0%, 89.5% and 88.3%, 
respectively, whereas it increased IL-10 expression by 131.8% compared to

patients with aberrant microRNA expression appeared to be more susceptible to 
autoimmune diseases. We recently found that miR-146a was up-regulated in 
activated B cells in response to rat acetylcholine receptor (AChR) α-subunit 
97-116 peptide, and this up-regulation was significantly attenuated by 
AntagomiR-146a. Our data also demonstrated that silencing miR-146a with its 
inhibitor AntagomiR-146a effectively ameliorated clinical myasthenic symptoms in 
mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Furthermore, 
multiple defects were observed after miR-146a was knocked down in B cells, 
including decreased anti-R97-116 antibody production and class switching, 
reduced numbers of plasma cells, memory B cells and B-1 cells, and weakened 
activation of B cells. Previously, miR-146a has been identified as a nuclear 
factor-κB-dependent gene and predicted to base pair with the tumour necrosis 
factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) genes to regulate the immune response. 
However, our study proved that miR-146a inhibition had no effect on the

only act as a physical barrier but also utilize pattern recognition receptors, 
such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), to detect and respond to pathogens. 
Members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription 
factors are key components of TLR signaling as they impart specificity to 
downstream responses. Although IRF6 is a critical regulator of epithelial cell 
proliferation and differentiation, its role in TLR signaling has not previously 
been addressed. We show here that IRF6 is activated by IRAK1 as well as by MyD88 
but not by TRIF or TBK1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further demonstrated 
that IRF6 can interact with IRAK1. Gene silencing in epithelial cells along with 
gene promoter reporter assays showed that IRAK1 mediates TLR2-inducible CCL5 
gene expression at least in part by promoting IRF6 activation. Conversely, IRAK1 
regulated CXCL8 gene expression independently of IRF6, thus identifying a 
molecular mechanism by which TLR2 signaling differentially regulates the 
expression of specific chemokines in epithelial cells. Bioinformatics analysis 
and mutagenesis-based experiments identified Ser-413 and Ser-424 as key 
regulatory sites in IRF6. Phosphomimetic mutation of these residues resulted in 
greatly enhanced IRF6 dimerization and trans-activator function. Collectively, 
our findings suggest that, in addition to its importance for epithelial barrier 
function, IRF6 also contributes to host defense by providing specificity to the 
regulation of inflammatory chemokine expression by TLR2 in epithelial cells.","© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M114.584540

involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can 
regulate inflammation and circadian clock machinery. We tested the hypothesis 
that altered daily rhythm of miR-146a expression in diabetes contributes to 
retinal inflammation.
METHODS: Nondiabetic and STZ-induced diabetic rats kept in 12/12 light/dark 
cycle were killed every 2 hours over a 72-hour period. Human retinal endothelial 
cells (HRECs) were synchronized with dexamethasone. Expression of miR-146a, IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), IL-1β, VEGF and ICAM-1, as well as clock 
genes was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot. To modulate expression 
levels of miR-146a, mimics and inhibitors were used.
RESULTS: Diabetes inhibited amplitude of negative arm (per1) and enhanced 
amplitude of the positive arm (bmal1) of clock machinery in retina. In addition 
to clock genes, miR-146a and its target gene IRAK1 also exhibited daily 
oscillations in antiphase; however, these patterns were lost in diabetic retina. 
This loss of rhythmic pattern was associated with an increase in ICAM-1, IL-β, 
and VEGF expression. Human retinal endothelial cells had robust miR-146a 
expression that followed circadian oscillation pattern; however, HRECs isolated 
from diabetic donors had reduced miR-146a amplitude but increased amplitude of 
IRAK1 and ICAM-1. In HRECs, miR-146a mimic or inhibitor caused 1.6- and 1.7-fold 
decrease or 1.5- and 1.6-fold increase, respectively, in mRNA and protein 
expression levels of ICAM-1 after 48 hours.

development of diabetic retinopathy.","Copyright 2014 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1167/iovs.13-13076

New York 14853, United States.","Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a crucial signaling kinase 
in the immune system, involved in Toll-like receptor signaling. 
Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a central player in cell 
migration that regulates actin polymerization and connects signaling events to 
cytoskeletal remodeling. A VASP–IRAK1 interaction is thought to be important in 
controlling macrophage migration in response to protein kinase C-ε activation. 
We show that the monomeric VASP EVH1 domain directly binds to the 168WPPPP172 
motif in the IRAK1 undefined domain (IRAK1-UD) with moderate affinity (KDApp = 
203 ± 3 μM). We further show that this motif adopts distinct cis and trans 
isomers for the Trp168–Pro169 peptide bond with nearly equal populations, and 
that binding to the VASP EVH1 domain is specific for the trans isomer, coupling 
binding to isomerization. Nuclear magnetic resonance line shape analysis and 
tryptophan fluorescence experiments reveal the complete kinetics and 
thermodynamics of the binding reaction, showing diffusion-limited binding to the 
trans isomer followed by slow, isomerization-dependent binding. We further 
demonstrate that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) catalyzes 
isomerization of the Trp168–Pro169 peptide bond and accelerates binding of the 
IRAK1-UD to the VASP EVH1 domain. We propose that binding of IRAK1 to tetrameric 
VASP is regulated by avidity through the assembly of IRAK1 onto 
receptor-anchored signaling complexes and that an isomerase such as CypA may 
modulate IRAK1 signaling in vivo. These studies demonstrate a direct interaction 
between IRAK1 and VASP and suggest a potential mechanism for how this 
interaction might be regulated by both assembly of IRAK1 onto an activated 
signaling complex and PPIase enzymes.","DOI: 10.1021/bi500031e

METHODS: Alveolar macrophages NR8383 were cultured and divided into two groups: 
transfected miR-146a mimic group was transfected 50 nmol/L Pre-miR miR-146a 
precursors and the negative control group was transfected Cy3-labeled Pre-miR

RESULTS: Compared with negative control group, the expression of miR-146a was

Patients with mutated TLR/MYD88 CLL had a higher frequency of mutated IGHV and 
low expression of CD38 and ZAP-70. Overall survival (OS) was better in 
TLR/MYD88-mutated than unmutated patients in the whole series (10-year OS, 100%

low-grade chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the underlying molecular and 
cellular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we examined the 
effects of a super-low dose of LPS on low-grade inflammation in macrophages as 
well as underlying mechanisms. We observed that a super-low dose of LPS induces 
mitochondrial fission and cell necroptosis in primary murine macrophages, 
dependent upon interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1). 
Mechanistically, our study reveals that a super-low dose of LPS causes protein 
ubiquitination and degradation of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), a molecule required for 
maintaining proper mitochondrial fusion. A super-low dose of LPS also leads to 
dephosphorylation and activation of Drp1, a molecule responsible for 
mitochondrial fission and cell necroptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a 
super-low dose of LPS activates receptor interacting protein 3 kinase (RIP3), a 
key molecule critical for the assembly of the necrosome complex, the initiation 
of Drp1 dephosphorylation, and necroptosis. The effects of a super-low dose of 
LPS are abolished in macrophages harvested from IRAK-1-deficient mice. Taken 
together, our study identified a novel molecular pathway that leads to cellular 
stress and necroptosis in macrophages challenged with a super-low dose of 
endotoxin. This may reconcile low-grade inflammation often associated with 
low-grade endotoxemia.","© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M114.569210

1 (TNFR1) induces the recruitment of adaptor proteins and their concomitant 
ubiquitination to the proximal receptor signaling complex, respectively. Such 
are upstream signaling events of IKK that play essential roles in NF-κB 
activation. Thus, the discovery of a substance that would modulate the 
recruitment of key proximal signaling elements at the upstream level of IKK has 
been impending in this field of study. Here, we propose that brazilin, an active 
compound of Caesalpinia sappan L. (Leguminosae), is a potent NF-κB inhibitor 
that selectively disrupts the formation of the upstream IL-1R signaling complex. 
Analysis of upstream signaling events revealed that brazilin markedly abolished 
the IL-1β-induced polyubiquitination of IRAK1 and its interaction with IKK-γ 
counterpart. Notably, pretreatment of brazilin drastically interfered the 
recruitment of the receptor-proximal signaling components including IRAK1/4 and 
TRAF6 onto MyD88 in IL-1R-triggerd NF-κB activation. Interestingly, brazilin did 
not affect the TNF-induced RIP1 ubiquitination and the recruitment of RIP1 and 
TRAF2 to TNFR1, suggesting that brazilin is effective in selectively suppressing 
the proximal signaling complex formation of IL-1R, but not that of TNFR1. 
Moreover, our findings suggest that such a disruption of IL-1R-proximal complex 
formation by brazilin is not mediated by affecting the heterodimerization of 
IL-1R and IL-1RAcP. Taken together, the results suggest that the anti-IKK 
activity of brazilin is induced by targeting IKK upstream signaling components 
and subsequently disrupting proximal IL-1 receptor signaling complex formation.",Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.bcp.2014.04.004

(SNPs) in pre-miRNAs can alter miRNA expression, and polymorphism in target 
molecules can affect binding to target mRNA. Studies have shown an association 
between miR-146a gene polymorphism and autoimmune diseases. A target for 
miR-146a is IRAK1. We studied the SNPs of miRNA-146 and IRAK1 to see their 
association with susceptibility to juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis-enthesitis-related arthritis (JIA-ERA). One hundred and fifty patients 
with JIA-ERA (ILAR criteria) were included in the study. A total of 216 blood

(rs2910164) and its target IRAK1 (rs1059703) at exon-12 region and IRAK1 
(rs3027898) at 3'UTR polymorphisms were analyzed using PCR-RFLP method. Among 
150 patients, 133 were males and the mean age at onset of disease was 11 (4-16)

susceptibility locus for a high number of autoimmune diseases. Our aim in the 
present study was to evaluate the influence of the IRAK1 and MECP2 
autoimmunity-associated genetic variants in the giant cell arteritis (GCA) 
susceptibility and its clinical subphenotypes.
METHODS: We analysed a total of 627 female biopsy-proven GCA patients and 1,520 
female healthy controls of Spanish Caucasian origin. Two polymorphisms, 
rs1059702 and rs17345, located at IRAK1 and MECP2, respectively, were genotyped

RESULTS: No association with any of the analysed polymorphisms was evident when

various mechanisms to avoid collateral organ damage in endotoxemia. A handful of 
reports have shown that innate immune responses are suppressed by the adaptive 
immune system. However, the molecular mechanism by which adaptive immune cells 
suppress innate inflammatory responses is not clear. Here, we report that T 
cells are shown to interact with macrophages at the early stage of enodotoxemia 
and to prolong survival of mice through controlling TNF and IL-10 levels by 
macrophage CD40 stimulation. The cross-talk between CD40 and toll-like receptor 
(TLR4) signaling first mediates IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) 
nuclear translocation and its binding to the IL-10 gene promoter in macrophages, 
without interfering with the NFκB pathway. IL-10 is then detected by macrophages 
in an autocrine fashion to destabilize Tnfa mRNA. To induce IRAK1-mediated IL-10 
expression, signals from both CD40 and TLR4 are essential. CD40 signaling 
induces IRAK1 sumoylation in the presence of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 
(TRAF2) and intracellular isoform of osteopontin (iOPN) whereas TLR4 signaling 
provides IFN regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) as a chaperone for sumoylated IRAK1 
nuclear translocation. Interaction of T cells with macrophages was observed in 
the spleen in vivo after endotoxemia induction with LPS injection. Our study 
demonstrates a mechanistic basis for the immunosuppressive role of macrophage 
CD40 in LPS endotoxemia.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1321427111

supplementation with L-glutamine plus L-alanine (GLN+ALA), both in the free form 
and L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide (DIP) in endotoxemic mice.
METHODS: B6.129 F2/J mice were subjected to endotoxemia (Escherichia coli 
lipopolysaccharide [LPS], 5 mg/kg, LPS group) and orally supplemented for 48 h 
with either L-glutamine (1 g/kg) plus L-alanine (0.61 g/kg) (GLN+ALA-LPS group) 
or 1.49 g/kg DIP (DIP-LPS group). Plasma glutamine, cytokines, and lymphocyte 
proliferation were measured. Liver and skeletal muscle glutamine, glutathione

(NF)-κB-interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1)-Myeloid 
differentiation primary response gene 88 pathway also were determined.
RESULTS: Endotoxemia depleted plasma (by 71%), muscle (by 44%), and liver (by 
49%) glutamine concentrations (relative to the control group), which were 
restored in both GLN+ALA-LPS and DIP-LPS groups (P < 0.05). Supplemented groups 
reestablished GSH content, intracellular redox status (GSSG/GSH ratio), and 
TBARS concentration in muscle and liver (P < 0.05). T- and B-lymphocyte 
proliferation increased in supplemented groups compared with controls and LPS 
group (P < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 β, and IL-10 
increased in LPS group but were attenuated by the supplements (P < 0.05). 
Endotoxemic mice exhibited higher muscle gene expression of components of the 
NF-κB pathway, with the phosphorylation of IκB kinase-α/β. These returned to 
basal levels (relative to the control group) in both GLN+ALA-LPS and DIP-LPS

in the healthy controls. IRAK1/4 inhibition was also associated with a decreased 
expression of IFN-γ and IL-17. Phosphorylation of NF-κB, STAT1, and STAT3 in 
CD4(+)T from healthy controls was significantly decreased after inhibition of 
IRAK1/4.
CONCLUSIONS: High mRNA levels of IRAK1 and IRAK4 correlated with VKH disease 
activity. IRAK1 and IRAK4 play a role in the activation and proliferation of 
CD4(+)T cells and the higher expression observed in VKH may contribute to the 
pathogenesis of this blinding condition.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0093214

protein in healthy individuals. Despite 60 years of research, its physiological 
role remains rather elusive. Familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy and 
medullary cystic kidney disease Type 2 are autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial 
nephropathies characterized by gouty arthritis and progressive renal 
insufficiency, caused by uromodulin (UMOD) mutations. The aim of this study was 
to compare the cellular effects of mutant and wild-type UMOD.
METHODS: Wild-type UMOD cDNA was cloned from human kidney cDNA into pcDNA3 
expression vector. A mutant UMOD construct, containing the previously reported 
mutation, V273, was created by in vitro mutagenesis. Transient and stable 
transfection studies were performed in human embryonic kidney cells and mouse 
distal convoluted tubular cells, respectively. Expression was evaluated by 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot and 
immunofluorescence. Oligosaccharide cleavage by glycosidases was performed to 
characterize different forms of UMOD. Nuclear translocation of P65 and 
degradation of IκBα and IRAK1 in response to interleukin (IL)-1β were used to 
evaluate the effects of wild-type and mutant UMOD on the IL-1R-NFκB pathway.
RESULTS: The mutant protein was shown to be retained in the endoplasmic 
reticulum and was not excreted to the cell medium, as opposed to the wild-type 
protein. NFκB activation in cells expressing mutant UMOD was similar to that of 
untransfected cells. In contrast, cells over-expressing wild-type UMOD showed 
markedly reduced NFκB activation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that UMOD may have a physiologic function 
related to its inhibitory effect on the NFκB pathway.","DOI: 10.1007/s40620-014-0079-7

and heterogeneous disorder that is influenced by both genetic and environmental 
factors. The underlying risk factors remain largely unclear for this 
heterogeneous disorder. In recent years, high throughput methodologies, such as 
genome-wide linkage analysis (GWL), genome-wide association (GWA) studies, and 
genome-wide expression profiling (GWE), have led to the identification of 
several candidate genes associated with AD. However, due to lack of consistency 
within their findings, an integrative approach is warranted. Here, we have 
designed a rank based gene prioritization approach involving convergent analysis 
of multi-dimensional data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
modelling.
RESULTS: Our approach employs integration of three different AD datasets- 
GWL,GWA and GWE to identify overlapping candidate genes ranked using a novel 
cumulative rank score (SR) based method followed by prioritization using 
clusters derived from PPI network. SR for each gene is calculated by addition of 
rank assigned to individual gene based on either p value or score in three 
datasets. This analysis yielded 108 plausible AD genes. Network modelling by 
creating PPI using proteins encoded by these genes and their direct interactors 
resulted in a layered network of 640 proteins. Clustering of these proteins 
further helped us in identifying 6 significant clusters with 7 proteins (EGFR, 
ACTB, CDC2, IRAK1, APOE, ABCA1 and AMPH) forming the central hub nodes. 
Functional annotation of 108 genes revealed their role in several biological 
activities such as neurogenesis, regulation of MAP kinase activity, response to 
calcium ion, endocytosis paralleling the AD specific attributes. Finally, 3 
potential biochemical biomarkers were found from the overlap of 108 AD proteins 
with proteins from CSF and plasma proteome. EGFR and ACTB were found to be the 
two most significant AD risk genes.
CONCLUSIONS: With the assumption that common genetic signals obtained from 
different methodological platforms might serve as robust AD risk markers than 
candidates identified using single dimension approach, here we demonstrated an 
integrated genomic convergence approach for disease candidate gene 
prioritization from heterogeneous data sources linked to AD.","DOI: 10.1186/1471-2164-15-199

activity is controversial. The mechanism of activation for IRAK4 is currently 
unknown, and little is known about the role of IRAK4 kinase in cytokine 
production, particularly in different human cell types. We show IRAK4 
autophosphorylation occurs by an intermolecular reaction and that 
autophosphorylation is required for full catalytic activity of the kinase. 
Phosphorylation of any two of the residues Thr-342, Thr-345, and Ser-346 is 
required for full activity, and the death domain regulates the activation of 
IRAK4. Using antibodies against activated IRAK4, we demonstrate that IRAK4 
becomes phosphorylated in human cells following stimulation by IL-1R and 
Toll-like receptor agonists, which can be blocked pharmacologically by a dual 
inhibitor of IRAK4 and IRAK1. Interestingly, in dermal fibroblasts, although 
complete inhibition of IRAK4 kinase activity does not inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 
production, NF-κB, or MAPK activation, there is complete ablation of these 
processes in IRAK4-deficient cells. In contrast, the inhibition of IRAK kinase 
activity in primary human monocytes reduces R848-induced IL-6 production with 
minimal effect on NF-κB or MAPK activation. Taken together, these studies define 
the mechanism of IRAK4 activation and highlight the differential role of IRAK4 
kinase activity in different human cell types as well as the distinct roles 
IRAK4 scaffolding and kinase functions play.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M113.544809

infections. Although the type I interferon response, elicited upon virus 
infection, is critical to establishing host antiviral innate immunity, EV71 
fails to induce this response efficiently. Here we provide new insights into 
potential anti-EV71 therapy by showing that neutralization of EV71-induced 
miR-146a prevents death in mice by restarting the production of type I 
interferon. EV71 infection upregulates miR-146a, which targets IRAK1 and TRAF6

AP1 as being responsible for the EV71-induced expression of miR-146a. 
Surprisingly, knocking out miR-146a or neutralizing virus-induced miR-146a by 
specific antagomiR restores expressions of IRAK1 and TRAF6, augments IFNβ 
production, inhibits viral propagation and improves survival in the mouse model.

Chengdu, 610000, Sichuan, China.","Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning is a powerful neuroprotective 
phenomenon by which an injurious stimulus renders the brain resistant to a 
subsequent damaging ischemic insult. The LPS response gene (Lrg) is a recently 
identified gene in human dental pulp cells treated with LPS. However, the role 
and mechanism of Lrg in brain ischemia injury have not yet been demonstrated. 
Here, we sought to determine whether Lrg participates in LPS 
preconditioning-induced brain ischemia injury. The Lrg protein accumulates in 
brain tissue after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Furthermore, 
knockdown of Lrg by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly increased the 
infarct size of brain injury. In addition, we investigated the mechanism of Lrg 
in brain ischemia injury. Lrg-siRNA could regulate inflammatory cytokine 
expression. Moreover, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and 
nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB) p65 protein levels were significantly increased 
by Lrg-siRNA in mice after MCAO. Conversely, interferon regulatory factor 3 
(IRF3) protein level was decreased by Lrg-siRNA. Taken together, these results 
suggest that Lrg regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS 
preconditioning-induced brain ischemia injury via the toll-like receptor 4

for brain ischemia injury.","DOI: 10.1007/s12031-014-0240-8

currently in clinical phase 2, for the therapy of advanced/poorly differentiated 
thyroid cancer. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway is constitutively 
activated in most tumors, including thyroid carcinomas; this often contributes 
to aggressive tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. We hypothesized that VPA 
could be useful to decrease NF-κB activity in human thyroid cancer cells. To 
clarify this, we treated the highly progressive thyroid cancer cell line BHT-101 
with VPA (1.0-3.0 mM) for 48 h. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
Western blot were used to measure expression of NF-κB-regulatory genes and 
proteins. NF-κB p50 activity was measured using an ELISA-based colorimetric 
transcription factor assay kit. We found that VPA significantly and 
dose-dependently impaired NF-κB activity reducing DNA binding activity of NF-κB 
p50 subunit by 30% at 1 mM, 40% at 1.5 mM, and 70% at 3 mM. Expression of 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) protein, an upstream 
mediator of NF-κB activation, was reduced by ̴30% at 1 and 1.5 mM. Furthermore, 
3 mM VPA treatment significantly decreased expressions of IRAK-1, phospho-IκBα 
and NF-κB p50 subunit protein by ̴ 50%. This is the first study to demonstrate 
that VPA decreases NF-κB activity in a progressive thyroid cancer cell line. 
Intriguingly, 1mM of VPA, a clinically safe dose in the therapeutic range for

adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines by endothelial cells. Our aim 
is to study a transcriptional activation pathway of the innate immune system 
through the cellular signalling cascade triggered by receptors Toll-like 
receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of endothelial cells after the 
exposure of these cells to seropositive ABGPI human serum obtained from PAD 
patients.
METHODS: We obtained serum samples from PAD patients and controls without PAD. 
ABGPI serum titer was detected using indirect immunofluorescence. Our sample was 
stratified into three groups: group I (PAD and ABGPI titer ≥1:100; n = 15), 
group II (PAD and ABGPI titer <1:100; n = 15), and control participants (no PAD; 
n = 15). All serum samples were incubated with human aortic endothelial cell 
(HAEC) culture. Genomic expression of TLR2 and TLR4 receptors and their shared 
intracellular signalling molecules, myeloid differentiation primary response 
gene 88 (MyD88), and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase (1IRAK1), 
were measured after the exposure of HAECs to each serum.
RESULTS: HAEC genomic expression of TLR4 was higher after the exposure to group 
I serum than after the exposure to group II serum (log10×10-relative 
quantification [RQ]: 1.80 ± 0.42 vs 1.37 ± 0.39; P = .01) or control serum 
(log10×10-RQ: 1.80 ± 0.42 vs 1.09 ± 0.26; P < .01). TLR4 expression was higher 
in group II than in the control group (log10×10-RQ: 1.37 ± 0.39 vs 1.09 ± 0.26; 
P = .04). TLR4 expression correlated with MyD88 (r = 0.54; P < .01) and IRAK1 (r 
= 0.55; P < .01) expression. We recorded a positive correlation between MyD88 
and IRAK1 genomic expression (r = 0.58; P < .01).

the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, controls NF-κB activation through its interaction 
with ubiquitin chains. We show here that stimulation with interleukin-1 (IL-1) 
and TNF induces a rapid and transient recruitment of NEMO into punctate 
structures that are anchored at the cell periphery. These structures are 
enriched in activated IKK kinases and ubiquitinated NEMO molecules, which 
suggests that they serve as organizing centers for the activation of NF-κB. 
These NEMO-containing structures colocalize with activated TNF receptors but not 
with activated IL-1 receptors. We investigated the involvement of nondegradative 
ubiquitination in the formation of these structures, using cells deficient in 
K63 ubiquitin chains or linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC)-mediated 
linear ubiquitination. Our results indicate that, unlike TNF, IL-1 requires 
K63-linked and linear ubiquitin chains to recruit NEMO into higher-order 
complexes. Thus, different mechanisms are involved in the recruitment of NEMO 
into supramolecular complexes, which appear to be essential for NF-κB

primary monocytes with pathogenic Neisseria or with purified 
lipooligosaccharides (LOS) after previous exposure to LOS induced immune 
tolerance, as evidenced by reduced TNF-α and IL-1β cytokine expression. LOS that 
we have previously shown to vary in their potential to activate TLR4 signaling, 
which was correlated with differences in levels of lipid A phosphorylation, had 
similarly variable ability to induce tolerance. Efficacy for induction of 
tolerance was proportional to the level of lipid A phosphorylation, as LOS from 
meningococcal strain 89I with the highest degree of phosphorylation was the most 
tolerogenic following retreatment with LOS or whole bacteria, compared with LOS 
from gonococcal strains 1291 and GC56 with reduced levels of phosphorylation. 
Hydrogen fluoride treatment of 89I LOS to remove phosphates rendered the LOS 
nontolerogenic. Tolerance induced by the more highly inflammatory meningococcal 
LOS was correlated with significantly greater downregulation of p38 activation, 
greater induction of the expression of A20 and of microRNA-146a, and greater 
reductions in IL-1R-associated kinase 1 and TRAF6 levels following LOS 
retreatment of cells. The role of miR-146a in regulation of induction of TNF-α 
was confirmed by transfecting cells with an inhibitor and a mimic of miR-146a. 
Our results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the variable 
pathophysiology of meningococcal and gonococcal infections given that after an 
initial exposure, greater upregulation of microRNA-146a by more highly

erythematosus (SLE) and its genetic background has not been completely 
clarified. The aim of this investigation was to analyze single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with lupus nephritis, its severe form 
proliferative nephritis and renal outcome, in two Swedish cohorts. Cohort I (n = 
567 SLE cases, n = 512 controls) was previously genotyped for 5676 SNPs and 
cohort II (n = 145 SLE cases, n = 619 controls) was genotyped for SNPs in STAT4, 
IRF5, TNIP1 and BLK. Case-control and case-only association analyses for 
patients with lupus nephritis, proliferative nephritis and severe renal 
insufficiency were performed. In the case-control analysis of cohort I, four 
highly linked SNPs in STAT4 were associated with lupus nephritis with genome 
wide significance with p = 3.7 × 10(-9), OR 2.20 for the best SNP rs11889341. 
Strong signals of association between IRF5 and an HLA-DR3 SNP marker were also 
detected in the lupus nephritis case versus healthy control analysis (p 
<0.0001). An additional six genes showed an association with lupus nephritis 
with p <0.001 (PMS2, TNIP1, CARD11, ITGAM, BLK and IRAK1). In the case-only 
meta-analysis of the two cohorts, the STAT4 SNP rs7582694 was associated with 
severe renal insufficiency with p = 1.6 × 10(-3) and OR 2.22. We conclude that

cytosolic protein complexes that activate caspase-1, leading to cleavage of 
pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 and to pyroptosis, a proinflammatory cell death program. 
Although microbial recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is known to induce 
the synthesis of the major caspase-1 substrate pro-IL-1β, the role of TLRs has 
been considered limited to up-regulation of the inflammasome components. During 
infection with a virulent microbe, TLRs and nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
domain-like receptors (NLRs) are likely activated simultaneously. To examine the 
requirements and outcomes of combined activation, we stimulated TLRs and a 
specific NLR, nucleotide binding and oligomerization, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin 
domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), simultaneously and discovered that such activation 
triggers rapid caspase-1 cleavage, leading to secretion of presynthesized 
inflammatory molecules and pyroptosis. This acute caspase-1 activation is 
independent of new protein synthesis and depends on the TLR-signaling molecule 
IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1) and its kinase activity. Importantly, 
Listeria monocytogenes induces NLRP3-dependent rapid caspase-1 activation and 
pyroptosis, both of which are compromised in IRAK-1-deficient macrophages. Our 
results reveal that simultaneous sensing of microbial ligands and virulence 
factors by TLRs and NLRP3, respectively, leads to a rapid TLR- and 
IRAK-1-dependent assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and that such 
activation is important for release of alarmins, pyroptosis, and early IFN-γ 
production by memory CD8 T cells, all of which could be critical for early host 
defense.","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1320294111

neriifolia) (Myrsinaceae) is a medicinal plants traditionally used in Myanmar to 
treat infectious and inflammatory diseases. Since none of reports have 
systematically demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of this plant, we 
aimed to mechanistically understand the regulatory roles of the plant in 
inflammatory responses using the ethanolic extract of Myrsine seguinii (Ms-EE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Activated macrophages and peritonitis symptoms induced by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were employed. HPLC analysis was used to identify 
active components. To characterize direct target enzymes, kinase assay was 
established.
RESULTS: Ms-EE inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin 
(PG)E2 in RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages stimulated by LPS. This 
extract suppressed the mRNA expression of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and 
cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 genes by down-regulating the activation of nuclear factor 
(NF)-κB and activator protein (AP-1). Interestingly, it was found that Ms-EE can 
directly suppress the enzyme activities of Syk, Src, and interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1). Similarly, orally administered Ms-EE 
inhibited the phosphorylation of Src and Syk in peritoneal exudate-derived cells 
prepared from peritonitis. Finally, HPLC analysis clearly demonstrated that 
quercetin is a major active component with suppressing activity on the release 
of inflammatory mediators (NO and PGE2), and the enzyme activities of Src, Syk, 
and IRAK-1.
CONCLUSION: Ms-EE containing quercetin negatively modulates macrophage-mediated 
in vitro inflammatory responses and LPS-induced peritonitis by blocking the 
Src/Syk/NF-κB and IRAK-1/AP-1 pathways, which contributes to its major 
ethnopharmacological use as an anti-inflammatory herbal medicine.",Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.033

crucial to tumorigenesis. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent 
malignancy worldwide. Up-regulation of miR-146 has been identified in OSCC 
tissues. However, the roles of miR-146 in carcinogenesis are controversial as it 
is suppressive in many other malignancies. The present study investigated the 
pathogenic implications of miR-146a in oral carcinogenesis. Microdissected OSCC 
exhibits higher levels of miR-146a expression than matched adjacent mucosal 
cells. The plasma miR-146a levels of patients are significantly higher than 
those of control subjects; these levels decrease drastically after tumor 
resection. miR-146a levels in tumors and in patients' plasma can be used to 
classify OSCC and non-disease status (sensitivity: >0.72). Exogenous miR-146a 
expression is significantly increased in vitro oncogenic phenotypes as well as 
during xenograft tumorigenesis and OSCC metastasis. The plasma miR-146a levels 
of these mice parallel the xenograft tumor burdens of the mice. A miR-146a 
blocker abrogates the growth of xenograft tumors. miR-146a oncogenic activity is 
associated with down-regulation of IRAK1, TRAF6 and NUMB expression. 
Furthermore, miR-146a directly targets the 3'UTR of NUMB and a region within the 
NUMB coding sequence when suppressing NUMB expression. Exogenous NUMB expression 
attenuates OSCC oncogenicity. Double knockdown of IRAK1 and TRAF6, and of TRAF6 
and NUMB, enhance the oncogenic phenotypes of OSCC cells. Oncogenic enhancement 
modulated by miR-146a expression is attenuated by exogenous IRAK1 or NUMB

current study, we found that HSV-2 infection induced activity of NF-kB reporter

MyD88/Mal alone or both significantly abolished productions of IL-6 and IFN-β by

of Gram-negative sepsis. Caveolin-1, the signaling protein associated with 
caveolae, is implicated in regulating the lung inflammatory response to LPS; 
however, the mechanism is not understood. In this study, we investigated the 
role of caveolin-1 in regulating TLR4 signaling in endothelial cells. We 
observed that LPS interaction with CD14 in endothelial cells induced 
Src-dependent caveolin-1 phosphorylation at Tyr(14). Using a 
TLR4-MD2-CD14-transfected HEK-293 cell line and caveolin-1-deficient 
(cav-1(-/-)) mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells, we demonstrated that 
caveolin-1 phosphorylation at Tyr(14) following LPS exposure induced caveolin-1

activation and generation of proinflammatory cytokines. Exogenous expression of 
phosphorylation-deficient Y14F caveolin-1 mutant in cav-1(-/-) mouse pulmonary 
vasculature rendered the mice resistant to LPS compared with reintroduction of 
wild-type caveolin-1. Thus, caveolin-1 Y14 phosphorylation was required for the 
interaction with TLR4 and activation of TLR4-MyD88 signaling and sepsis-induced 
lung inflammation. Inhibiting caveolin-1 Tyr(14) phosphorylation and resultant 
inactivation of TLR4 signaling in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells represent 
a novel strategy for preventing sepsis-induced lung inflammation and injury.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1300873

dual function cytokine. Many different cell types, tissue cells and leukocytes, 
produce IL-33 either constitutively or after stimulation and release it by a 
poorly defined molecular mechanism. Free IL-33 acts as a classical cytokine by 
binding to target cells expressing receptors for IL-33 minimally consisting of 
ST2 and IL-1RAcP. Depending on the target cell type IL-33 will stimulate 
cell-type specific signal transduction mechanisms and thereby change the 
biosynthetic profile of the respective cell. In addition, it is stored in the 
nucleus of cells and may be released after cell stress, death by injury or 
necrosis, acting as an alarmin by orchestrating a sterile inflammation. 
Furthermore, IL-33 has intracrine functions in the cell producing it, which are 
independent of IL-33 receptors. Intracellular IL-33 is predominantly found in 
the nucleus associated to the chromatin and may exert gene regulatory function 
by yet poorly defined mechanisms. It is the aim of this review to address two

especially innate immunity, against viral infections. Toll-like receptor 9 
recognizes intracellular viral double-strand DNA, which leads to the activation 
of nuclear factor B (NF-κB) through the myeloid differentiation primary response 
88 (MYD88) pathway. Defects in the expression of TLR9 and its signaling 
molecules may cause attenuated immune responses against hepatitis B virus.
OBJECTIVE: To determine expression levels of TLR9 messenger RNA along with 
MYD88, interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and NF-κB in the peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells obtained from chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB)-infected 
patients.
DESIGN: In this study, 60 CHB patients and 60 healthy controls were recruited 
and the expression of TLR9 and its downstream signaling molecules was examined 
by real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques using β-actin as a 
housekeeping gene.
RESULTS: Our results showed that expression of TLR9, MYD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, and 
NF-κB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CHB patients was significantly 
decreased in comparison with healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, it appears that CHB patients are unable 
to appropriately express genes in the TLR9 pathway, which may impede immune 
responses against hepatitis B virus infection. These results suggest a mechanism 
that may partially explain the fact that immune responses are disrupted in CHB 
patients.","DOI: 10.5858/arpa.2012-0415-OA

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The rs2910164C>G genotypes were determined in 1094 
patients with lung cancer and 1100 healthy controls who were frequency matched 
for age and gender.
RESULTS: The rs2910164 CG or GG genotype was associated with a significantly 
decreased risk for lung cancer compared to that of the CC genotype (adjusted 
odds ratio=0.80, 95% confidence interval=0.66-0.96, P=0.02). When subjects were 
stratified according to smoking exposure (never, light and heavy smokers), the 
effect of the rs2910164C>G genotype on lung cancer risk was significant only in

inflammatory cytokines (IL-12 and IL-6) were evaluated by Real-Time PCR and 
ELISA techniques.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that expression of IRAK4, TRAF3, and IRF7 were 
significantly decreased in PBMCs of CHB patients in comparison to healthy 
controls. Serum levels of IL-12 were significantly increased, while, IL-6 were 
not differ between patients and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results presented here it seems that CHB patients do 
not express appropriate levels of the genes in the TLRs pathway which may lead 
to impaired immune responses against HBV infection which is seen in the 
patients.","Copyright © 2013 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics. All

this study, we characterized a pair of crustacean homologs of Tube and Pelle in 
Scylla paramamosain, namely, SpTube and SpPelle, and analyzed their immune 
functions. The full-length cDNA of SpTube had 2052 bp with a 1578 bp open 
reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein with 525 aa. A death domain (DD) and a 
kinase domain were predicted in the deduced protein. The full-length cDNA of 
SpPelle had 3825 bp with a 3420 bp ORF encoding a protein with 1140 aa. The 
protein contained a DD and a kinase domain. Two conserved repeat motifs 
previously called Tube repeat motifs present only in insect Tube or Tube-like 
sequences were found between these two domains. Alignments and structure 
predictions demonstrated that SpTubeDD and SpPelleDD significantly differed in 
sequence and 3D structure. Similar to TubeDD, SpTubeDD contained three common 
conserved residues (R, K, and R) on one surface that may mediate SpMyD88 binding 
and two common residues (A and A) on the other surface that may contribute to 
Pelle binding. By contrast, SpPelleDD lacked similar conservative residues. 
SpTube, insect Tube-like kinases, and human IRAK4 were found to be RD kinases 
with an RD dipeptide in the kinase domain. SpPelle, Pelle, insect Pelle-like 
kinases, and human IRAK1 were found to be non-RD kinases lacking an RD 
dipeptide. Both SpTube and SpPelle were highly expressed in hemocytes, gills, 
and hepatopancreas. Upon challenge, SpTube and SpPele were significantly 
increased in hemocytes by Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, whereas only 
SpPelle was elevated by White Spot Syndrome Virus. The pull-down assay showed 
that SpTube can bind to both SpMyD88 and SpPelle. These results suggest that 
SpTube, SpPelle, and SpMyD88 may form a trimeric complex involved in the 
immunity of mud crabs against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0076728

suppressing cytokine-induced expression of interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase-1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) 
by impairing NF-κB activity and inhibiting the expression of target genes. 
Recent study suggests that histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in the 
regulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression. Therefore, we determined whether HDAC 
inhibitors can increase miR-146a expression, thereby inhibiting interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β)-induced signaling in osteoarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(OA-FLS).
METHOD: MiRNA expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. IL-1β-induced 
downstream signals and cytokine expression were evaluated using Western blotting 
and ELISA. Transcription factors regulating promoter activation were identified 
using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
RESULTS: IL-1β treatment of OA-FLS induced a mild (1.7-fold) increase in 
miR-146a expression that was unable to appropriately downregulate IRAK1 and 
TRAF6 expression. HDAC inhibitors, SAHA (vorinostat), and LBH589 (panobinostat) 
significantly (6.1- and 5.4-fold) elevated miR-146a expression by increasing the 
binding of the transcription factor NF-κB to the miR-146a promoter, and 
negatively regulated IL-1β-induced IKK/IκB/p65 phosphorylation signaling and 
IL-6 secretion. The increase in miR-146a expression induced by the HDAC 
inhibitors was prevented by transfection of miR-146a inhibitor or HDAC1 (class I 
HDAC), HDAC4 (class IIa HDAC), and HDAC6 (class IIb HDAC) overexpression, 
suggesting that they were due to inhibition of HDAC activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that HDAC inhibitor treatment in OA-FLS 
significantly increased miR-146a expression and mediated markedly negative 
regulation to inhibit IL-1β-induced signaling and cytokine secretion. Our 
results indicate the potential rationale of anti-inflammatory effects for HDAC 
inhibitors.","Copyright © 2013 Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Published by

of particular concern, mainly due to the increased application of diagnostic and 
therapeutic X-ray modalities. The mechanisms behind the cell and tissue 
responses to low doses remain to be elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests 
that low doses of ionizing radiation induce activation of the immune response; 
however, the processes involved have yet to be adequately investigated. 
Monocytes are key players in the induction of an immune response. Within the 
context of this study, we investigated the activation of toll-like receptors 
(TLRs), mitogen‑activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-κB signaling in 
isolated human primary monocytes in response to low doses (0.05 and 0.1 Gy) and 
a high dose (1 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Using quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA 
techniques, our results showed a positive regulation of TLR signaling in 
response to low doses but a less significant response at high doses. This 
activation was demonstrated via the activation of TLR signaling molecules 
(HMGB1, TLR4, TLR9, MyD88 and IRAK1). Furthermore, and in contrast to the high 
dose, the low doses showed increased phosphorylation levels of the protein IκBα, 
and therefore positive signaling of the NF-κB pathway. This result denotes 
pro-survival and pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, MAPKs were activated 
in response to 0.05 Gy, while 0.1 and 1 Gy showed a downregulatory trend that 
may be related to activation of the PF4 gene. On the other hand, there was 
highly significant involvement of activated p53 and damaged genes in response to 
high but not low doses. In conclusion, this study addressed the need to 
re-evaluate health risks arising from exposure to low doses of ionizing 
radiation, particularly in view of the accumulating evidence reporting

Expression of TNF-α, TNFRI, TRAF2, ILRI, IRAK-1 and TRAF6 correlated with at

in innate immunity. Currently, 11 members of TLRs have been identified in 
humans, with important function in host defense in early steps of the 
inflammatory response. TLRs are present in the plasma membrane (TLR1, TLR2, 
TLR4, TLR5, TLR6) and endosome (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9) of leukocytes. TLRs and 
IL-1R are a family of receptors related to the innate immune response that 
contain an intracellular domain known as the Toll-IL-1R (TIR) domain that 
recruits the TIR-containing cytosolic adapters MyD88, TRIF, TIRAP and TRAM. The 
classical pathway results in the activation of both nuclear factor κB and MAPKs 
via the IRAK complex, with two active kinases (IRAK-1 and IRAK-4) and two 
non-catalytic subunits (IRAK-2 and IRAK-3/M). The classical pro-inflammatory TLR 
signaling pathway leads to the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNF-α. In humans, genetic 
defects have been identified that impair signaling of the TLR pathway and this 
may result in recurrent pyogenic infections, as well as virus and fungi 
infections. In this review, we discuss the main mechanisms of microbial

defenders against microbes and critical to CNS remodeling. Dysregulation of 
microglial behavior can lead to unchecked pro-inflammatory activity and 
subsequent neurodegeneration. The molecular mechanisms leading to chronic 
inflammation and microglial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases are not 
well-understood. It is known that patients with Presenilin 2 (PS2) mutations 
develop autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease. We have shown that a lack of 
normal PS2 function is associated with exaggerated microglia pro-inflammatory 
responses in vitro. To identify pathways by which PS2 regulates microglia and 
determine how PS2 dysfunction may lead to altered inflammatory pathways, we 
pursued an unbiased array approach to assess differential expression of 
microRNAs between murine PS2 knockout (KO) and wild-type microglia. We 
identified miR146, a negative regulator of monocyte pro-inflammatory response, 
as constitutively down-regulated in PS2 KO microglia. Consistent with a state of 
miR146 suppression, we found that PS2 KO microglia express higher levels of the 
miR146 target protein interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1, and have 
increased NFκB transcriptional activity. We hypothesize that PS2 impacts 
microglial responses through modulation of miR146a. PS2 dysfunction, through 
aging or mutation, may contribute to neurodegeneration by influencing the 
pro-inflammatory behavior of microglia. Presenilin 2 (PS2), a membrane

constituent penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (PGG) inhibited NF-κB activation in 
LPS-stimulated peritoneal and colonic macrophages. Here we have investigated PGG 
mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory effects of PGG in vitro and in vivo.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male C57BL/6 mice (18-22 g, 6 weeks old) were used to 
prepare peritoneal and colonic macrophages and for the induction of colitis by 
intrarectal administration of 2,3,4-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS). A 
range of inflammatory markers and transcription factors were evaluated by elisa, 
immunoblotting, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.
KEY RESULTS: Expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 or Lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) binding to TLR-4 in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages was not affected 
by PGG. However PGG inhibited binding of an anti-MyD88 antibody to peritoneal 
macrophages, but did not reduce binding of anti-IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 
(IRAK1) and IRAK4 antibodies to the macrophages with or without transfection 
with MyD88 siRNA. PGG potently reduced the activation of IRAK1, NF-κB, and MAPKs 
in LPS- or pepetidoglycan-stimulated peritoneal and colonic macrophages. PGG 
suppressed IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, while 
increasing expression of the anti-inflammatorycytokine IL-10. Oral 
administration of PGG inhibited colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in 
mice with TNBS-induced colitis, along with reducing NF-κB activation and IL-1β, 
TNF-α, and IL-6 levels, whereas it increased IL-10.

anti-inflammatory molecules produced during the early phase, such as Dual 
Specificity Phosphatase 1, and a modest effect on IL-10 secretion. The 
LPS/TLR4-stimulated production of il6 and tnfa mRNA and IL-6 and TNF-α secretion 
was hardly affected, because the Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter-inducing

Although interleukin-4 (IL-4) is shown to potently induce the expression of 
arginase 1 and contribute to differentiation of macrophages to the 
anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, other modulators may potentiate or reduce the 
effect of IL-4. In this report, we focus on the combinatorial effects of IL-4 
with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ATRA has been 
shown to contribute to the resolution of inflammation, however it has not been 
linked to arginase 1 expression in macrophages. We demonstrate that although 
ATRA alone has no effect on the expression or activities of arginase 1, ATRA can 
dramatically potentiate the induction of arginase 1 by IL-4. On the other hand, 
high doses of LPS, such as those seen in septic shock, can induce the expression 
of both M1 and M2 mediators in macrophages. The effects of subclinical doses of 
LPS, which are prevalent in humans with adverse health conditions, on macrophage 
differentiation are not well studied. We demonstrate that low dose LPS can 
effectively suppress the expression of arginase 1 induced by IL-4 and ATRA. 
Mechanistically, we report that the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK-1) and Toll-interacting-protein (Tollip) are involved in the suppressive

Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes alter susceptibility to bacterial infections and 
modulate white blood cell (WBC) counts during infections in very low birth 
weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight <1500 g).
STUDY DESIGN: VLBW infants recruited in a multicenter study were genotyped for 
nine functional TLR SNPs and associations between SNPs and infection rates 
examined. WBC counts obtained during infections were compared among infants with 
and without SNPs.
RESULT: In our cohort (n=408), 90 infants developed bacterial infections. 
Presence of TLR4 (rs4986790 and rs4986791) variants were associated with 
Gram-negative (G-ve) infections. Female infants heterozygous for the X-linked 
IRAK1 (rs1059703) SNP had less G-ve infections. In regression models controlling 
for confounders, the TLR4 (rs4986790) SNP was associated with increased G-ve 
infections. The TLR5 (rs5744105) variant was associated with elevated WBC counts 
during infections.
CONCLUSION: TLR genetic variants can contribute to increased risk of bacterial 
infections and altered immune responses in VLBW infants.","DOI: 10.1038/jp.2013.80

TLR/IL1R-mediated cell activation during inflammatory response. Studies 
indicated that pending on the nature of the used inflammatory model, 
downregulation of IRAK1 may be beneficial or detrimental. However, the role of 
IRAK1 in affecting outcome in polymicrobial sepsis is unknown. We tested this

Sepsis-induced mortality was markedly lower in IRAK1-deficient mice (35 %) 
compared to WT (85 %). Sepsis-induced increases in blood IL-6 and IL-10 levels 
were blunted at 6 h post-CLP in IRAK1 deficiency compared to WT, but cytokine

depletion of splenic B cells were also blunted in IRAK1-deficient mice as 
compared to WT. Analysis of TLR-mediated cytokine responses by IRAK1-deficient 
and WT macrophages ex vivo indicated a TLR4-dependent downregulation of IL-6 and 
IL1β in IRAK1 deficiency, whereas TLR2-dependent responses were unaffected. 
TLR7/8-mediated IL-6, IL1β, and IL-10 production was also blunted in IRAK1

University, Shandong University, Jinan, PR China.","BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in the defense 
against invading pathogens by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns 
(PAMPs). TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the cell walls of 
Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in the induction and secretion of 
proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. The WW domain containing E3 
ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) regulates a variety of cellular biological 
processes. Here, we investigated whether WWP1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in 
TLR-mediated inflammation.
METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: Knocking down WWP1 enhanced the TNF-α and IL-6 production 
induced by LPS, and over-expression of WWP1 inhibited the TNF-α and IL-6 
production induced by LPS, but not by TNF-α. WWP1 also inhibited the IκB-α, 
NF-κB, and MAPK activation stimulated by LPS. Additionally, WWP1 could degrade 
TRAF6, but not IRAK1, in the proteasome pathway, and knocking down WWP1 reduced 
the LPS-induced K48-linked, but not K63-linked, polyubiquitination of endogenous 
TRAF6.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We identified WWP1 as an important negative regulator 
of TLR4-mediated TNF-α and IL-6 production. We also showed that WWP1 functions 
as an E3 ligase when cells are stimulated with LPS by binding to TRAF6 and 
promoting K48-linked polyubiquitination. This results in the proteasomal 
degradation of TRAF6.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067633

inflammatory responses that, subsequently, prime specific adaptive responses. 
Several mechanisms control TLR activity to avoid excessive inflammation and 
consequent immunopathology, including the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. 
Recently, several TLR-responsive microRNAs (miRs) have also been proposed as 
potential regulators of this signaling pathway, but their functional role during 
the inflammatory response still is incompletely understood. In this study, we 
report that, after LPS engagement, monocytes up-regulate miR-146b via an 
IL-10-mediated STAT3-dependent loop. We show evidence that miR-146b modulates 
the TLR4 signaling pathway by direct targeting of multiple elements, including 
the LPS receptor TLR4 and the key adaptor/signaling proteins myeloid 
differentiation primary response (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK-1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Furthermore, we 
demonstrate that the enforced expression of miR-146b in human monocytes led to a 
significant reduction in the LPS-dependent production of several proinflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, CCL3, CCL2, CCL7, and

MATERIALS AND RESULTS: The colitic mice were prepared by intrarectal injection

polarization markers, by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of 200 LAB strains

MIRAKIL changes in young cells; in senescent cells CoQ10H₂ supplementation 
significantly attenuated LPS-induced miR-146a and IRAK-1 modulation but failed 
to curb IL-6 release. Similar results were obtained with long-term CoQ10H₂

the lumen of the organelle, triggering signal transduction events that 
contribute either to cellular adaptation and recovery or alternatively to 
cellular dysfunction and death. ER stress has been implicated in numerous

library screen of the kinome, revealing Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated 
Kinase-2 (IRAK2) as a contributor to unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling

IRAK1) in cultured mammalian cells suppresses ER stress-induced expression of 
the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP and activation of stress kinases. 
Similarly, RNAi-mediated silencing of the IRAK family member Tube (but not 
Pelle) suppresses activation of stress kinase signaling induced by ER stress in 
Drosophila cells. The action of IRAK2 maps to the IRE1 pathway, rather than the 
PERK or ATF6 components of the UPR. Interestingly, ER stress also induces IRAK2 
gene expression in an IRE1/XBP1-dependent manner, suggesting a mutually 
supporting amplification loop involving IRAK2 and IRE1. In vivo, ER stress 
induces Irak2 expression in mice. Moreover, Irak2 gene knockout mice display 
defects in ER stress-induced CHOP expression and IRE1 pathway signaling. These 
findings demonstrate an unexpected linkage of the innate immunity machinery to

study, we sought to characterize the upregulation of TIFA by 
hypoxia-reoxygenation and investigate its role in hypoxia-induced signaling. 
TIFA expression was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in both mouse 
hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation (HS-R) and hepatocytes exposed to 
hypoxia-reoxygenation. Involvement of TLR4 and MyD88 was assessed using cells 
from TLR4(-/-) and MyD88(-/-) mice. The interaction of TIFA with TRAF6 and

to knock down the endogenous expression of the TIFA gene in hepatocytes. 
High-mobility-group box 1 protein (HMGB1) expression was detected by Western

after HS-R in vivo and hypoxia-reoxygenation in vitro. Further analysis revealed 
that hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced upregulation of TIFA was TLR4- and 
MyD88-dependent. Moreover, TIFA was found to associate with TRAF6 
constitutively, whereas its association with IRAK-1 was seen only after 
hypoxia-reoxygenation. Suppression of TIFA by siRNA reduced NF-κB activation and 
HMGB1 upregulation and release after hypoxia-reoxygenation. Taken together,

(LTA) on the key bone resorption-regulating proteins, receptor activator of 
nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in human periodontal 
ligament fibroblasts (PDL cells).
METHODOLOGY: Periodontal ligament cells were subjected to various concentrations 
of LTA. Cell viability was then determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) 
assay, whilst the expression levels of RANKL and OPG were investigated by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. The effect of 
the inhibitors [IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1/4, p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (SB203580)] on LTA-stimulated RANKL/OPG

also analysed by MTT assay and Western blotting. Data were analysed using 
one-way anova or t-test at a significance level of P = 0.05.
RESULT: Cell viability was reduced significantly in the LTA group in a 
dose-dependent fashion (P < 0.05). In addition, LTA was found to upregulate the 
protein expression of RANKL, OPG and their relative ratio in PDL cells (P <

10 μg mL(-1) . Following IRAK1/4 and p38MAPK inhibition, LTA-stimulated

expression and explored its regulatory function in the inflammatory response in 
human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs).
METHODS: miRNA-146a and miRNA-146b-5p expression was measured by performing 
real-time polymerase chain reaction in HGFs after Porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g) 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. After the HGFs were transfected with 
miRNA-146a and miRNA-146b-5p inhibitor, the expression levels of interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, IL-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 
(TRAF6) were detected by western blot and quantitative PCR. A luciferase assay 
was used to detect whether miRNA-146 could directly bind to the 3'-UTR of IRAK1.
RESULTS: The expression levels of miRNA-146a and miRNA-146b-5p significantly 
increased in the P.g LPS-stimulated HGFs compared to the non-stimulated HGFs. 
The inhibition of miRNA-146a and miRNA-146b-5p resulted in increased IL-1β, IL-6 
and TNF-α secretion. The mRNA and protein levels of IRAK1, but not TRAF6, also 
increased. We further found that miRNA-146a and miRNA-146b-5p directly bound to 
the IRAK1 3'-UTR.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that miRNA-146 inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine 
secretion through IRAK1 in HGFs, which indicates that miRNA-146 functions as a 
negative regulator of periodontal inflammation.","DOI: 10.1186/1476-9255-10-20

MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein) branch of the 
bifurcated TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) signaling pathway, in contrast to 
diphosphoryl lipid A (sDLA), which is a strong activator of both branches of 
TLR4. sMLA's weak MyD88 signaling activity is apparent downstream of TLR4/MyD88 
signaling as we show that sMLA, unlike sDLA, is unable to efficiently recruit 
the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to the Interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1). This reduced recruitment of TRAF6 explains 
MLA's lower MAPK (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase) and NF-κB activity. As 
further tests of sMLA's ability to activate TLR4/Myeloid differentiation factor 
2 (MD-2), we used the antibody MTS510 as an indicator for TLR4/MD-2 
heterotetramer formation. Staining patterns with this antibody indicated that 
sMLA does not effectively drive heterotetramerization of TLR4/MD-2 when compared 
to sDLA. However, a F126A mutant of MD-2, which allows lipid A binding but 
interferes with TLR4/MD-2 heterotetramerization, revealed that while sMLA is 
unable to efficiently form TLR4/MD-2 heterotetramers, it still needs 
heterotetramer formation for the full extent of signaling it is able to achieve. 
Monophosphoryl lipid A's weak ability to form TLR4/MD-2 heterotetramers was not 
restricted to synthetic E. coli type because cells exposed to a biological 
preparation of S. minnesota monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) also showed reduced 
TLR4/MD-2 heterotetramer formation. The low potency with which sMLA and MPLA

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be upregulated during TLR signaling. 
Specifically, microRNA-146a (miR-146a) plays a key role in endotoxin tolerance 
by downregulating interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1). The aim 
of this study was to assess the role of miR-146a in the TLR2 signaling and 
development of bacterial lipoprotein (BLP) self-tolerance and cross-tolerance to 
bacteria. Expression of miR-146a increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner 
in BLP-stimulated human THP-1 promonocytic cells. In BLP-tolerised cells 
miR-146a was even further upregulated in response to BLP re-stimulation 
(p<0.001). Re-stimulation of BLP-tolerised cells with heat-killed gram-negative 
Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), but not gram-positive Staphylococcus 
aureus (S. aureus), led to significant overexpression of miR-146a (p<0.05). 
Transfection of naive cells with a miR-146a mimic substantially suppressed TNF-α 
production (p<0.05). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-146a resulted in strong 
reduction in IRAK-1 and phosphorylated IκBα expression in naive and S. 
typhimurium-stimulated THP-1 cells. Collectively, miR-146a is upregulated in 
response to BLP and bacterial stimulation in both naive and BLP-tolerised cells. 
Overexpression of miR-146a induces a state analogous to tolerance in 
BLP-stimulated cells and therefore may represent a future target for exogenous

the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like 
helicases, cells are activated to produce type I interferon (IFN) and 
proinflammatory cytokines. These pathways are tightly regulated by the host to 
prevent an inappropriate cellular response, but viruses can modulate these 
pathways to proliferate and spread. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism 
in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to 
proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that HCV 
infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN

miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid 
differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1

activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling

(AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV 
infection through PKCε/JNK/c-Jun and PKCα/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, 
our results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and 
negatively regulates IFN-α signaling through MyD88 and IRAK1 and may be a

downregulation of NRAS. 16K PRL stimulated the release of miR-146a-loaded 
exosomes from ECs. The exosomes were absorbed by cardiomyocytes, increasing 
miR-146a levels, which resulted in a subsequent decrease in metabolic activity 
and decreased expression of Erbb4, Notch1, and Irak1. Mice with 
cardiomyocyte-restricted Stat3 knockout (CKO mice) exhibited a PPCM-like

implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration. The 
microRNAs miR-146a and miR-146b-5p can regulate the inflammatory process by 
attenuating cytokine signaling via the nuclear factor-κB pathway. The aim of the 
present study is to investigate the expression of miR-146a and miR-146b-5p in 
human RPE cells and their response to proinflammatory cytokines.
METHODS: Confluent cultures of RPE cells established from adult human donor eyes 
were treated with the proinflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-1β. The expression of microRNAs 
was analyzed by real-time PCR using total RNA fraction. The retinal pigment 
epithelial cell line ARPE-19 was employed to analyze the promoter activity of 
the genes encoding miR-146a and miR-146b-5p. STAT1-binding activity of 
oligonucleotides was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ARPE-19 
cells were transiently transfected with miR-146a and miR-146b-5p mimics for the 
analysis of IRAK1 expression by western immunoblotting.
RESULTS: Real-time PCR analysis showed that miR-146a and 146b-5p are expressed 
in RPE cells. The cells responded to proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ + TNF-α + 
IL-1β) by highly increasing the expression of both miR-146a and miR-146b-5p. 
This was associated with an increase in the expression of transcripts for CCL2, 
CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL-6, and a decrease in that for HMOX1. The miR-146a 
induction was more dependent on IL-1β, since its omission from the cytokine mix 
resulted in a greatly reduced response. Similarly, the induction of miR-146b-5p 
was more dependent on IFN-γ, since its omission from the cytokine mix minimized 
the effect. In addition, the increase in MIR146B promoter activity by the 
cytokine mix was effectively blocked by JAK inhibitor 1, a known inhibitor of 
the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The expression of IRAK1 protein was decreased 
when ARPE-19 cells were transiently transfected with either miR-146a mimic or 
miR-146b-5p mimic.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show that both miR-146a and miR-146b-5p are 
expressed in human RPE cells in culture and their expression is highly induced 
by proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ + TNF-α + IL-1β). The induction of miR-146a 
showed a dependency on IL-1β, while that of miR-146b-5p on IFN-γ. Our results 
show for the first time that miR-146b-5p expression is regulated by IFN-γ, 
potentially via the JAK/STAT pathway. These two microRNAs could play a role in 
inflammatory processes underlying age-related macular degeneration or other 
retinal degenerative diseases through their ability to negatively regulate the 
nuclear factor-κB pathway by targeting the expression of IRAK1.","PMCID: PMC3626297

regulators of gene expression transcriptionally. MicroRNA-146a(miR-146a) has 
been demonstrated to be one of the key molecules in oncogenesis and inflammatory 
responses. Few data describe the expression of miR-146a in liver 
ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. The present study sought to explore the 
relationship of miR-146a to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathways in a 
rat model of warm IR injury.
METHODS: The expression of miR-146a was detected by real-time 
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using a partial warm hepatic IR 
injury model. The expression of TLR4, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated 
factor 6 (TRAF6), and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK 1) protein 
was assessed by Western blotting as well as the signaling pathways induced by 
TLR4.
RESULTS: The expression of hepatic miR-146a was down-regulated in IR injury 
during the 24 hours after reperfusion, reaching the lowest level at 6 hours 
after reperfusion. Increases in TLR4, TRAF6, and IRAK1 were accompanied by 
decreased miR-146a during the 24 hours after reperfusion, peaking at 6 hours. 
Immunohistochemistry showed cytoplasmic expression of cells positive for TLR4, 
and nuclear expression of cells positive for nuclear factor κB p65 and c-jun to 
be increased among IR groups after reperfusion.

non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1059702 is responsible for the 
Xq28 association with SSc or whether there are other independent signals in the 
nearby methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2).
METHODS: We analysed a total of 3065 women with SSc and 2630 unaffected controls 
from five independent Caucasian cohorts. Four tag single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms of MECP2 (rs3027935, rs17435, rs5987201 and rs5945175) and the 
IRAK1 variant rs1059702 were genotyped using TaqMan predesigned assays. A 
meta-analysis including all cohorts was performed to test the overall effect of 
these Xq28 polymorphisms on SSc.
RESULTS: IRAK1 rs1059702 and MECP2 rs17435 were associated specifically with 
diffuse cutaneous SSc (PFDR=4.12×10(-3), OR=1.27, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47, and 
PFDR=5.26×10(-4), OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.48, respectively), but conditional 
logistic regression analysis showed that the association of IRAK1 rs1059702 with 
this subtype was explained by that of MECP2 rs17435. On the other hand, IRAK1 
rs1059702 was consistently associated with presence of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), 
because statistical significance was observed when comparing SSc patients PF+

    Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2013 Apr;9(4):197.","Genetic polymorphism in MECP2/IRAK1 on chromosome Xq28 is a confirmed and 
replicated susceptibility locus for lupus. High linkage disequilibrium in this 
locus suggests that both MECP2 and IRAK1 are candidate genes for the disease. 
DNA methylation changes in lupus T cells play a central role in the pathogenesis 
of lupus, and MeCp-2 (encoded by MECP2) is a master regulator of gene expression 
and is also known to recruit DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) during DNA 
synthesis. Using human T cells from normal individuals with either the lupus 
risk or the lupus protective haplotype in MECP2/IRAK1, we demonstrate that 
polymorphism in this locus increases MECP2 isoform 2 mRNA expression in 
stimulated but not unstimulated T cells. By assessing DNA methylation levels 
across over 485,000 methylation sites across the entire genome, we further 
demonstrate that the lupus risk variant in this locus is associated with 
significant DNA methylation changes, including in the HLA-DR and HLA-DQ loci, as 
well as interferon-related genes such as IFI6, IRF6, and BST2. Further, using a 
human MECP2 transgenic mouse, we show that overexpression of MECP2 alters gene 
expression in stimulated T cells. This includes overexpression of Eif2c2 that 
regulates the expression of multiple microRNAs (such as miR-21), and the histone 
demethylase Jhdm1d. In addition, we show that MECP2 transgenic mice develop 
antinuclear antibodies. Our data suggest that the lupus-associated variant in 
the MECP2/IRAK1 locus has the potential to affect all 3 epigenetic mechanisms: 
DNA methylation, microRNA expression, and histone modification. Importantly, 
these data support the notion that variants within the MECP2 gene can alter DNA 
methylation in other genetic loci including the HLA and interferon-regulated 
genes, thereby providing evidence for genetic-epigenetic interaction in lupus.",Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jaut.2012.12.012

representative ethnomedicinal herbal plant prescribed for various inflammatory 
diseases such as pharyngolaryngitis and tonsillitis. However, the pharmacology 
behind this plant's anti-inflammatory properties has not been fully understood. 
Therefore, in this study, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of a 95% methanol 
extract (Ac-ME) was explored.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory mechanism of Ac-ME on the AP-1 
activation pathway, which plays a critical role in the production of 
prostaglandin (PG)E2 in RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages and in 
induction of acute gastritis caused by HCl/EtOH, was investigated using 
immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation analyses, and reporter gene activity assays. 
In particular, enzyme assays and HPLC analysis were employed to identify direct 
target enzymes of Ac-ME and to detect active chemical components from the plant 
extract.
RESULTS: Ac-ME clearly reduced the nuclear levels of total and phospho-forms of 
c-Jun, FRA-1, and ATF-2. Consequently, this extract suppressed both the 
production of PGE2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 and peritoneal 
macrophage cells and PGE2-dependent induction of gastritis lesion in stomach 
under EtOH/HCl exposure. Analysis of AP-1 upstream signalling revealed that the 
AP-1 activation pathway consisting of IRAK1, TRAF6, TAK1, MKK3/6, and p38 was 
predominantly inhibited by Ac-ME. Similarly, this extract directly blocked the 
enzyme activity of IRAK1, indicating that this enzyme is an inhibitory target of 
Ac-ME and is involved in the suppression of the AP-1 pathway. HPLC analysis 
showed that quercetin, which inhibits PGE2 production, is an active component in 
Ac-ME.
CONCLUSION: Ac-ME is an ethnomedicinal remedy with an IRAK1/p38/AP-1-targeted 
inhibitory property. Since AP-1 is a major inflammation-inducing transcription 
factor, the therapeutic potential of Ac-ME in other AP-1-mediated inflammatory 
symptoms will be further tested.",Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2013.01.034

interactions, densely located at sites of microbial entry into the host where 
they are continuously exposed to products from commensals. In order to avoid 
excessive activation and the associated pathology, mast cell responses to TLR 
agonists must be tightly regulated. Here, we show that exposure in vitro to 
subactivating levels of the epithelial cell product, IL-33, renders mast cells 
insensitive to bacterial cell wall products. Mast cell responsiveness to Ag, 
cytoplasmic dsDNA, and TLR7/8 agonists is unaffected or enhanced by IL-33. The 
IL-33-induced mast cell selective tolerance requires the IL-33 receptor ST2 and 
peritoneal mast cells from St2(-/-) mice display a constitutively activated 
phenotype, demonstrated by increased expression of activation markers including 
CD11b and CD28. IL-33 exposure neither affects the levels of TLR4, MyD88, TIRAP, 
IL-1R associated kinase 2 (IRAK2), or IRAK4, nor induces persistent A20 or 
Tollip expression, but potently causes ST2-dependent IRAK1 degradation. We show 
that while IRAK2 is redundant for TLR4 signaling, IRAK1 is essential for TLR4 
signaling in mast cells. We suggest that IL-33 produced during homeostasis 
retains mast cells in an unresponsive state to bacterial cell wall products via 
IRAK1 degradation, thus preventing chronic inflammation and tissue destruction.","© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.","DOI: 10.1002/eji.201242786

Previous work indicated that IRAK1 negatively regulates TRIF-mediated activation

pathway. Following TLR3 stimulation, IRAK1-deficient macrophages produced 
increased levels of IL-6 and IFN-β compared with wild type macrophages. 
Pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 reduced this increase in IFN-β, together with 
the heightened activation of IRF3 and p65 found in TLR3-ligand stimulated 
IRAK1-deficient macrophages. Recently, IKKε and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) 
were reported to limit activation of the NF-κB pathway downstream of IL-1R, 
TNFR1, and TLRs. We show that TBK1 has a positive role in the TLR3-NF-κB 
pathway, because we detected reduced levels of IL-6 and reduced activation of 
p65 in TBK1-deficient macrophages. In contrast, we show that IKKε limits the 
activation of the TLR3-NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, we show that IRAK1 is

such as IL-1β in the affected joint. Delphinidin, an anthocyanidin found in 
pigmented fruits and vegetables, has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant properties. In the present study we determined whether delphinidin 
would inhibit the IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB in human chondrocytes and 
determined the mechanism of its action.
METHODS: PGE2 levels and activation of NF-κB p65 in human OA chondrocytes were 
determined by ELISA-based assays. Protein expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 
(COX-2) and phosphorylation of kinases was determined by western immunoblotting. 
Expression level of mRNAs was determined by TaqMan assays.
RESULTS: Delphinidin inhibited IL-1β-induced expression of COX-2 and production 
of PGE2 in human chondrocytes. Delphinidin also inhibited IL-1β-mediated 
phosphorylation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-1(Ser376), phosphorylation of 
IKKα/β, expression of IKKβ, degradation of IκBα, and activation and nuclear 
translocation of NF-κB/p65. Phosphorylation of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 was not 
observed but NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) was phosphorylated and phosphorylation 
of NIK was blocked by delphinidin in IL-1β-treated human chondrocytes.
CONCLUSION: These data identify delphinidin as a novel inhibitor of 
IL-1β-induced production of cartilage-degrading molecule PGE2 via inhibition of 
COX-2 expression and provide new insight into the mechanism of its action. Our 
results also identify inhibition of IRAK1(Ser376) phosphorylation by delphinidin

RESULTS: We weighted the functional attributes based on various functional 
properties observed between cancerous and non-cancerous genes reported from 
literature. This weighing schema was then encoded in a Boolean logic framework 
to rank differentially expressed genes. We have identified 17 genes to be 
differentially expressed from a total of 11,173 genes, where ten genes are 
reported to be down-regulated via epigenetic inactivation and seven genes are 
up-regulated. Here, we report that the overexpressed genes IRAK1, CHEK1 and BUB1

expression via p38 MAP kinase-dependent signaling. Although induction of the 
heat shock response can restore alveolar fluid clearance compromised by IL-1β 
following the onset of severe hemorrhagic shock in rats, the mechanisms are not 
fully understood. In this study, we report that the induction of the heat shock 
response prevents IL-1β-dependent inhibition of αENaC mRNA expression and 
subsequent channel function. Heat shock results in IRAK1 detergent insolubility 
and a disruption of Hsp90 binding to IRAK1. Likewise, TAK1, another client 
protein of Hsp90 and signaling component of the IL-1β pathway, is also detergent 
insoluble after heat shock. Twenty-four hours after heat shock, both IRAK1 and 
TAK1 are again detergent soluble, which correlates with the IL-1β-dependent p38 
activation. Remarkably, IL-1β-dependent p38 activation 24 h after heat shock did 
not result in an inhibition of αENaC mRNA expression and channel function. 
Further analysis demonstrates prolonged preservation of αENaC expression by the 
activation of the heat shock response that involves inducible Hsp70. Inhibition 
of Hsp70 at 24 h after heat shock results in p38-dependent IL-1β inhibition of 
αENaC mRNA expression, whereas overexpression of Hsp70 attenuates the 
p38-dependent IL-1β inhibition of αENaC mRNA expression. These studies 
demonstrate new mechanisms by which the induction of the heat shock response

other cellular functions. Therefore, characterizing the entire human interactome 
is a key effort in current proteomics research. This challenge is complicated by 
the dynamic nature of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are conditional 
on the cellular context: both interacting proteins must be expressed in the same 
cell and localized in the same organelle to meet. Additionally, interactions 
underlie a delicate control of signaling pathways, e.g. by post-translational 
modifications of the protein partners - hence, many diseases are caused by the 
perturbation of these mechanisms. Despite the high degree of cell-state 
specificity of PPIs, many interactions are measured under artificial conditions 
(e.g. yeast cells are transfected with human genes in yeast two-hybrid assays) 
or even if detected in a physiological context, this information is missing from 
the common PPI databases. To overcome these problems, we developed a method that 
assigns context information to PPIs inferred from various attributes of the 
interacting proteins: gene expression, functional and disease annotations, and 
inferred pathways. We demonstrate that context consistency correlates with the 
experimental reliability of PPIs, which allows us to generate high-confidence 
tissue- and function-specific subnetworks. We illustrate how these 
context-filtered networks are enriched in bona fide pathways and disease 
proteins to prove the ability of context-filters to highlight meaningful 
interactions with respect to various biological questions. We use this approach 
to study the lung-specific pathways used by the influenza virus, pointing to 
IRAK1, BHLHE40 and TOLLIP as potential regulators of influenza virus 
pathogenicity, and to study the signalling pathways that play a role in

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of the methanol extract from the leaves of 
this plant (Rt-ME) on the production of inflammatory mediators [nitric oxide 
(NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)] and the molecular mechanism of Rt-ME-mediated 
inhibition, including target enzymes, were studied with RAW264.7, peritoneal 
macrophage, and HEK293 cells. Additionally, the in vivo anti-inflammatory 
activity of this extract was evaluated with mouse gastritis and colitis models.
RESULTS: Rt-ME clearly inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 in 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages in 
a dose-dependent manner. According to RT-PCR, immunoblotting and 
immunoprecipitation analyses and a kinase assay with mRNA, whole cell extract,

capable of suppressing the activation of both nuclear factor (NF)-κB and

matter) received an intramammary LPS challenge (200 μg; CON-LPS, OVE-LPS, 
respectively). Liver biopsies were harvested at -14 d from calving, and 
postpartum at 2.5h post-LPS on d 7, 14, and 30. Prepartum, the OVE group was in 
more positive energy balance (EB) and had greater body condition score compared 
with CON. In contrast, during wk 1 postpartum and before the LPS challenge, the 
OVE group was in greater negative EB than CON. Prepartal diet did not affect 
postpartal milk production or dry matter intake. At 2h postchallenge on d 7, we 
observed an increase in serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and bilirubin and 
a decrease in hydroxybutyrate, regardless of diet. That was coupled with greater 
haptoglobin in OVE-LPS compared with CON-LPS. In addition, OVE-LPS cows versus 
CON nonchallenged, OVE nonchallenged, and CON-LPS had greater liver 
triacylglycerol (TAG) concentration 2.5h postchallenge on d 7. The concentration 
of TAG in liver of OVE-LPS remained elevated by 30d postpartum. The liver TAG 
concentration in OVE-LPS compared with CON-LPS cows was associated with greater 
serum concentration of NEFA and reactive oxygen metabolites on d 10 and 14 
postpartum. Cows in OVE-LPS also had greater concentrations of ceruloplasmin, 
cholesterol, and vitamin E from d 10 through 21. Among 28 genes associated with 
fatty acid oxidation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gluconeogenesis, only 
SAA3 (which encodes an acute phase protein) was greater in CON-LPS compared with 
OVE-LPS at 2.5h postchallenge. Expression of HP, which encodes another acute 
phase protein, was greater in OVE-LPS than in CON-LPS at 14 and 30 d postpartum. 
Several inflammation-related genes (TNF, IRAK1, NFKB1, ANGPTL4) showed markedly 
decreased expression between 7 and 14 d, after which expression remained 
unchanged. No differences were observed in several genes of the 
growth-hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, except for SOCS2, expression 
of which decreased markedly between 7 and 14 d in OVE-LPS but not in CON-LPS.

(1)Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, 
Yonsei University, Yonsei-ro 50, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 120-749, Korea.","BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by a slow, progressive 
degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantianigra. The cause of 
neuronal loss in PD is not well understood, but several genetic loci, including 
PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), have been linked to early-onset 
autosomal recessive forms of familial PD. Neuroinflammation greatly contributes 
to PD neuronal degeneration and pathogenesis. IL-1 is one of the principal 
cytokines that regulates various immune and inflammatory responses via the 
activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and activating protein-1. Despite 
the close relationship between PD and neuroinflammation, the functional roles of 
PD-linked genes during inflammatory processes remain poorly understood.
METHODS: To explore the functional roles of PINK1 in response to IL-1β 
stimulation, HEK293 cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from PINK1-null 
(PINK1-/-) and control (PINK1+/+) mice, and 293 IL-1RI cells stably expressing 
type 1 IL-1 receptor were used. Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis 
were performed to detect protein-protein interaction and protein ubiquitination. 
To confirm the effect of PINK1 on NF-κB activation, NF-κB-dependent firefly 
luciferase reporter assay was conducted.
RESULTS: PINK1 specifically binds two components of the IL-1-mediated signaling 
cascade, Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1). The association of PINK1 with Tollip, a negative regulator of IL-1β 
signaling, increases upon IL-1β stimulation, which then facilitates the 
dissociation of Tollip from IRAK1 as well as the assembly of the IRAK1-TNF 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) complex. PINK1 also enhances Lys63-linked 
polyubiquitination of IRAK1, an essential modification of recruitment of NF-κB 
essential modulator and subsequent IκB kinase activation, and increases 
formation of the intermediate signalosome including IRAK1, TRAF6, and 
transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1. Furthermore, PINK1 stimulates 
IL-1β-induced NF-κB activity via suppression of Tollip inhibitory action.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PINK1 upregulates IL-1β-mediated 
signaling through the functional modulation of Tollip and IRAK1. These results 
further suggest that PINK1 stimulates the ubiquitination of proximal molecules 
and increases signalosome formation in the IL-1β-mediated signaling pathway. The 
present study therefore supports the idea of the close relationship between 
neuroinflammation and PD.","DOI: 10.1186/1742-2094-9-271

METHODS: A total of 2,334 unrelated Korean participants (including 1,318 
patients with RA) were genotyped for 5 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) and 3 additional SNPs in an Xq28 region harboring MECP2 and IRAK1. 
Twenty-nine additional neighboring SNPs were imputed using the Korean HapMap

effects.
RESULTS: RA susceptibility was associated with multiple SNPs in a 79-kb linkage 
disequilibrium block harboring both MECP2 and IRAK1. The most significant 
association was for MECP2 SNP rs1734792 (P = 0.00089), but 2 nonsynonymous IRAK1

RESULTS: Ho-ME strongly inhibited the release of NO, PGE(2), and TNF-α in 
RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS). Ho-ME also clearly suppressed the gene expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines, such as interferon (IFN)-β, interleukin (IL)-12, and 
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). By analysing the inhibited target 
molecules, Syk and Src were found to be suppressed in the inhibition of nuclear 
factor (NF)-κB pathway. In addition, the observed downregulation of activator 
protein (AP)-1 and cAMP response element-binding (CREB) was due to the direct 
inhibition of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)1 and IRAK4, which 
was also linked to the suppression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. In 
agreement with the in vitro observations, this extract also ameliorated the 
inflammatory symptoms in EtOH/HCl-induced gastritis and arachidonic acid-induced 
ear oedemas in mice.
CONCLUSION: Ho-ME has potential as a functional herbal remedy targeting Syk- and 
Src-mediated anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Future pre-clinical studies will be

or TLR2 modulation protects against myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) 
injury. The mechanisms involve attenuation of I/R-induced nuclear factor KappaB 
(NF-κB) activation. MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) has been reported to target 
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), resulting in inhibiting NF-κB 
activation. This study examined the role of microRNA-146a in myocardial I/R 
injury.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We constructed lentivirus expressing miR-146a (LmiR-146a). 
LmiR-146a was transfected into mouse hearts through the right common carotid 
artery. The lentivirus vector (LmiR-Con) served as vector control. Untransfected 
mice served as I/R control. Sham operation served as sham control. Seven days 
after transfection, the hearts were subjected to ischaemia (60 min) followed by 
reperfusion (4 h). Myocardial infarct size was analysed by triphenyltetrazolium 
chloride (TTC) staining. In separate experiments, the hearts were subjected to 
ischaemia (60 min) followed by reperfusion for up to 7 days. Cardiac function 
was measured by echocardiography prior to I/R, 3 and 7 days after myocardial 
I/R. LmiR-146a transfection significantly decreased I/R-induced myocardial 
infarct size by 55% and prevented I/R-induced decreases in ejection fraction 
(EF%) and fractional shortening (%FS). LmiR-146a transfection attenuated 
I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis and caspase-3/7 and -8 activities. LmiR-146a 
transfection suppresses IRAK1 and TRAF6 expression in the myocardium. In 
addition, transfection of LmiR-146a prevented I/R-induced NF-κB activation and 
inflammatory cytokine production.
CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA-146a protects the myocardium from I/R injury. The 
mechanisms may involve attenuation of NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine 
production by suppressing IRAK1 and TRAF6.","DOI: 10.1093/cvr/cvs356

central to the regulation of proinflammatory markers. An imbalance in the TLRs 
expression may lead to several types of inflammatory disorders. Furthermore, the 
dynamic regulation of inflammatory activity and associated impaired production 
of cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in obese individulas 
remain poorly understood. Therefore, we determined the perturbation in TLRs 
(TLR2 and TLR4), their adaptor proteins (MyD88, IRAK1 and TRAF6) expression in 
PBMCs/subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) as well as inflammatory cytokines changes 
in obese individuals.
METHODS: mRNA expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, IL-6, TNF-α and adaptor proteins 
were determined by RT-PCR. TLR2, TLR4 and adaptor proteins expression in AT was 
determined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Obese and overweight individuals showed significantly increased 
expression of TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 in both PBMCs and AT as compared with lean 
individuals (P < 0.05). Interestingly, we found a remarkably higher expression 
of TLRs in obese and overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes (P < 0.05). 
Increased expression of TLR2, TLR4, MyD88 and IRAK1 correlated with body mass 
index (BMI) (TLR2: r = 0.91; TLR4: r = 0.88, P <0.0001; MyD88: r = 0.95, 
P < 0.0001; IRAK1 r = 0.78, P < 0.002). TLRs' expression was also correlated 
with fasting blood glucose (FBG) (TLR2: r = 0.61, P < 0.002; TLR4: r = 0.52, 
P < 0.01) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ( TLR2: r = 0.44, P <0.03; TLR4: 
r = 0.48, P < 0.03). Transcript levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were highly elevated in 
obese subjects compared to lean subjects. There was a strong association of 
TLRs' expression in PBMCs with TNF-α (TLR2: r = 0.92; TLR4: r = 0.92; 
P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (TLR2: r = 0.91, P < 0.0001; TLR4: r = 0.81; P < 0.001). 
Similarly adaptor proteins were significantly correlated with TNF-α (MyD88: 
r = 0.9, P < 0.0001; IRAK1: r = 0.86; P < 0.0002) and IL-6 (MyD88: r = 0.91, 
P < 0.0001; IRAK1: 0.77; P < 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: TLRs and adapter proteins were overexpressed in PBMCs from obese 
subjects, which correlated with increased expression of TNF-α and IL-6. This 
association may explain a potential pathophysiological link between obesity and 
inflammation leading to insulin resistance.","DOI: 10.1186/1476-9255-9-48

defense against pathogen. We identified interferon-inducible tripartite-motif 
(TRIM) 56 as a regulator of double-stranded DNA-mediated type I interferon 
induction. TRIM56 interacted with STING and targeted it for lysine 63-linked 
ubiquitination. This modification induced STING dimerization, which was a 
prerequisite for recruitment of the antiviral kinase TBK1 and subsequent 
induction of IFN-beta. Taken together, these results show that TRIM56 is an 
interferon-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase that modulates STING to confer 
double-stranded DNA-mediated innate immune responses. It is well known that 
Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 sense viral nucleic acids and induce 
production of type I interferon (IFN) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to 
protect the host from virus infection. We showed that the IFN-inducible 
antiviral protein Viperin promoted TLR7- and TLR9-mediated production of type I 
IFN by pDCs. Viperin expression was potently induced after TLR7 or TLR9 
stimulation and Viperin localized to the cytoplasmic lipid-enriched 
compartments, lipid bodies, in pDCs. Viperin interacted with the signal 
mediators IRAK1 and TRAF6 to recruit them to the lipid bodies and facilitated 
K63-linked ubiquitination of IRAK1 to induce the nuclear translocation of

signaling mediators of the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathways. IRAKs are Ser/Thr 
kinases. There are 4 members in the vertebrate genome (IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAKM, and 
IRAK4) and an IRAK homolog, Pelle, in insects. IRAK family members are highly 
conserved in vertebrates, but the evolutionary relationship between IRAKs in 
vertebrates and insects is not clear. To investigate the evolutionary history 
and functional divergence of IRAK members, we performed extensive bioinformatics 
analysis. The phylogenetic relationship between IRAK sequences suggests that 
gene duplication events occurred in the evolutionary lineage, leading to early 
vertebrates. A comparative phylogenetic analysis with insect homologs of IRAKs 
suggests that the Tube protein is a homolog of IRAK4, unlike the anticipated 
protein, Pelle. Furthermore, the analysis supports that an IRAK4-like kinase is 
an ancestral protein in the metazoan lineage of the IRAK family. Through 
functional analysis, several potentially diverged sites were identified in the 
common death domain and kinase domain. These sites have been constrained during 
evolution by strong purifying selection, suggesting their functional importance 
within IRAKs. In summary, our study highlighted the molecular evolution of the 
IRAK family, predicted the amino acids that contributed to functional 
divergence, and identified structural variations among the IRAK paralogs that 
may provide a starting point for further experimental investigations.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0049771

regulating normal and pathologic functions. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
is one of the key regulators of pulpal pathogenesis. This study investigated how 
LPS regulates microRNA expression and affects the phenotype of human dental pulp 
cells (DPCs).
METHODS: Primary DPCs were established and immortalized to achieve immortalized 
DPCs (I-DPCs). DPCs and I-DPCs were treated with LPS and examined to identify 
changes in microRNA expression, cell proliferation, and cell migration. 
Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to detect 
changes in gene expression. Exogenous miR-146a expression was performed 
transfection with pre-mir-146a mimic. Knockdown of interleukin 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated 
factor 6 (TRAF6) expression was performed by small interference oligonucleotide 
transfection. Western blot analysis was used to detect changes in the expression 
of the IRAK1 and TRAF6 proteins.
RESULTS: The differentiation of DPCs was induced by osteogenic medium. I-DPCs 
had a higher level of human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene than the 
parental DPCs. Up-regulation of miR-146a expression and an increase in migration 
was induced by LPS treatment of DPCs and I-DPCs. Exogenous miR-146a expression 
increased the migration of DPCs and I-DPCs and down-regulated the expression of 
IRAK1 and TRAF6. Knockdown of IRAK1 and/or TRAF6 increased the migration of

that involves cholesterol deposition in arteries. Together with scavenger 
receptor B1 (SR-B1), the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 are 
the major components of macrophage cholesterol efflux. Recent studies have shown 
that low-grade inflammation plays a distinct regulatory role in the expression 
of SR-B1 and ABCA1/ABCG1. However, the mechanisms linking low-grade inflammation 
and cholesterol accumulation are poorly understood.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages, we 
demonstrate that subclinical low-dose lipopolysaccharide potently reduces the 
expression of SR-B1 and ABCA1/ABCG1, as well as cholesterol efflux from 
macrophages through interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and 
Toll-interacting-protein. Low-dose lipopolysaccharide downregulates the nuclear 
levels of retinoic acid receptor-α, leading to their reduced binding to the 
promoters of SR-B1 and ABCA1/ABCG1. We observe that glycogen synthase kinase 3β 
activation by low-dose lipopolysaccharide through interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 and Toll-interacting-protein is responsible for 
reduced levels of retinoic acid receptor-α, and reduced expression of SR-B1 and 
ABCA1/ABCG1. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase M, however, counteracts 
the function of interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1.

macrophages and leads to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.","DOI: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300049

pathophysiological conditions associated with oxidative stress and infections. 
Such conditions are associated with an appearance of altered-self ligands in 
circulation that can be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Platelets 
express a number of TLRs, including TLR9; however, the role of TLR in platelet 
function and thrombosis is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biological activities of carboxy(alkylpyrrole) 
protein adducts, an altered-self ligand generated in oxidative stress, on 
platelet function and thrombosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study we show that carboxy(alkylpyrrole) protein 
adducts represent novel unconventional ligands for TLR9. Furthermore, using 
human and murine platelets, we demonstrate that carboxy(alkylpyrrole) protein 
adducts promote platelet activation, granule secretion, and aggregation in vitro 
and thrombosis in vivo via the TLR9/MyD88 pathway. Platelet activation by TLR9 
ligands induces IRAK1 and AKT phosphorylation, and it is Src kinase-dependent. 
Physiological platelet agonists act synergistically with TLR9 ligands by 
inducing TLR9 expression on the platelet surface.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that platelet TLR9 is a functional platelet 
receptor that links oxidative stress, innate immunity, and thrombosis.","DOI: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.274241

studies have shown that the cell-cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) also exerts

activity-dependent and -independent manners. The present study was conducted to 
discern how p16(INK4a) modulates macrophages, which are the major source of 
inflammatory cytokines in inflamed synovial tissues. We found that p16(INK4a) 
suppresses LPS-induced production of IL-6 but not of TNF-α from macrophages. 
This inhibition did not depend on CDK4/6 activity and was not observed in RSF. 
p16(INK4a) gene transfer accelerated LPS-triggered IL-1R-associated kinase 1 
(IRAK1) degradation in macrophages but not in RSF. The degradation inhibited the 
AP-1 pathway without affecting the NF-κB pathway. Treatment with a proteosome 
inhibitor prevented the acceleration of IRAK1 degradation and downregulation of 
the AP-1 pathway. THP-1 macrophages with forced IRAK1 expression were resistant 
to the p16(INK4a)-induced IL-6 suppression. Senescent macrophages with 
physiological expression of p16(INK4a) upregulated IL-6 production when 
p16(INK4a) was targeted by specific small interfering RNA. These findings 
indicate that p16(INK4a) promotes ubiquitin-dependent IRAK1 degradation, impairs 
AP-1 activation, and suppresses IL-6 production. Thus, p16(INK4a) senescence 
gene upregulation inhibits inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages in a 
different way than in RSF.","DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1103156

Attenuated chemokine responses were associated with IRAK-1 protein degradation. 
Inhibition of RV-induced IRAK-1 degradation restored NTHi-stimulated IL-8 
expression. Knockdown of TLR2, but not other MyD88-dependent TLRs, also restored 
IRAK-1, suggesting that TLR2 is required for RV-induced IRAK-1 degradation.In 
conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that RV infection delays bacterial 
clearance in vivo and suppresses NTHi-stimulated chemokine responses via 
degradation of IRAK-1. Based on these observations, we speculate that modulation 
of TLR-dependent innate immune responses by RV may predispose the host to 
secondary bacterial infection, particularly in patients with underlying chronic 
respiratory disorders.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002969

genes encoding the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway modulate 
susceptibility to preterm birth (PTB).
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case-control study examining the contribution of nine 
TLR SNPs to PTB (<37 weeks) and PTB <32 weeks. Genotyping was done on neonatal 
blood using a multiplexed single-base extension assay. Chi-square test, 
Fischer's exact test and classification trees were used for data analysis.
RESULT: Preterm infants (n=177) were more likely to be African American 
(P=0.02), and were more likely to be born to mothers who smoked (P=0.007), had 
pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH; P=0.002) and placental abruption (P=0.0004) 
when compared with term infants (n=146). The TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, nuclear 
factor-kappa B1 (NFκB1), NFκBIA and IRAK1 variants were not associated with PTB 
whereas the TIR domain receptor-associated protein (TIRAP) variant was more 
prevalent in term infants when compared with preterm infants born <32 weeks 
(P=0.004). PTB <32 weeks was more prevalent in infants without the TIRAP variant 
whose mothers had PIH and did not smoke (P=0.001). Presence of the TIRAP variant 
protected against PTB <32 weeks (P=0.015) in Caucasian infants.
CONCLUSION: In our study, a TLR pathway adapter variant (TIRAP (rs8177374)) 
protected against PTB<32 weeks, supporting our hypothesis that genetic variation 
in the innate immune signaling pathway contributes to altered risk of PTB.","DOI: 10.1038/jp.2012.120

regulation of inflammation in human neurological disorders. In the present study 
we investigated the role of miR-146a, a key regulator of the innate immune 
response, in the modulation of astrocyte-mediated inflammation. Using Taqman PCR 
and in situ hybridization, we studied the expression of miR-146a in 
epilepsy-associated glioneuronal lesions which are characterized by prominent 
activation of the innate immune response. In addition, cultured human astrocytes 
were used to study the regulation of miR-146a expression in response to 
proinflammatory cytokines. qPCR and western blot were used to evaluate the 
effects of overexpression or knockdown of miR-146a on IL-1β signaling. 
Downstream signaling in the IL-1β pathway, as well as the expression of IL-6 and 
COX-2 were evaluated by western blot and ELISA. Release several cytokines was 
evaluated using a human magnetic multiplex cytokine assay on a Luminex® 
100™/200™ platform. Increased expression of miR-146a was observed in 
glioneuronal lesions by Taqman PCR. MiR-146a expression in human glial cell 
cultures was strongly induced by IL-1β and blocked by IL-1β receptor antagonist. 
Modulation of miR-146a expression by transfection of astrocytes with 
anti-miR146a or mimic, regulated the mRNA expression levels of downstream 
targets of miR-146a (IRAK-1, IRAK-2 and TRAF-6) and the expression of IRAK-1 
protein. In addition, the expression of IL-6 and COX-2 upon IL-1β stimulation 
was suppressed by increased levels of miR-146a and increased by the reduction of 
miR-146a. Modulation of miR-146a expression affected also the release of several 
cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Our observations indicate that in response to 
inflammatory cues, miR-146a was induced as a negative-feedback regulator of the 
astrocyte-mediated inflammatory response. This supports an important role of 
miR-146a in human neurological disorders associated with chronic inflammation

inflammation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the potential 
involvement of miRNA-126 and miRNA-146a. Escherichia coli lipopolysacharides

transcription nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and acts as a negative feedback 
loop regulator involving IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 downregulation. In this study, the 
down-regulation of NF-κB was accompanied by reduced miRNA-146a expression. 
LPS-challenge induced mRNA levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)

traditionally prescribed to treat various inflammatory diseases. However, how 
this plant is able to modulate inflammatory responses is unknown. This study 
explored the anti-inflammatory effects of 99% methanol extracts of O. stellata 
(Os-ME).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory effect of Os-ME was evaluated by 
measuring the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 macrophage cells and by determining 
gastric inflammatory lesions in mice induced by HCl/ethanol (EtOH). The 
molecular mechanisms of the inhibitions were elucidated by analyzing the 
activation of transcription factors, upstream signaling cascade, and the kinase 
activities of target enzymes.
RESULTS: Os-ME dose-dependently diminished the release of NO and PGE(2), and 
suppressed the expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in 
LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. Os-ME clearly inhibited the translocation of c-Rel, 
a subunit of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and c-Fos, a subunit of activator 
protein-1 (AP-1), and their regulatory upstream enzymes including Src, Syk, and 
IRAK1. Interestingly, orally administered Os-ME ameliorated acute inflammatory 
symptoms and suppressed the activation of Src, Syk, and IRAK1 induced by

synthesis and was regulated at the transcriptional level through an endosomal 
pH-sensitive TLR9/MyD88 signaling pathway. Over-expression of the dominant 
negative (DN) form of or gene-specific knockdown of signaling modulators in the 
TLR9 pathway demonstrated that IRAK4, IRAK1, IRAK2, and PKD1 are required for

partially, but significantly, inhibited CpG DNA-induced Irak-m promoter

the late phase of TLR9 signaling by sustaining activation of PKD1 that leads to 
activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. Irak-m promoter-luciferase reporters with 
alterations in the predicted cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements

risk locus for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in previous genetic 
association studies. However, due to the strong linkage disequilibrium between 
IRAK1 and MECP2, it remains unclear which gene is affected by the underlying 
causal variant(s) conferring risk of SLE.
METHODS: We fine-mapped ≥136 SNPs in a ∼227 kb region on Xq28, containing IRAK1, 
MECP2 and seven adjacent genes (L1CAM, AVPR2, ARHGAP4, NAA10, RENBP, HCFC1 and 
TMEM187), for association with SLE in 15 783 case-control subjects derived from 
four different ancestral groups.
RESULTS: Multiple SNPs showed strong association with SLE in European Americans, 
Asians and Hispanics at p<5×10(-8) with consistent association in subjects with 
African ancestry. Of these, six SNPs located in the TMEM187-IRAK1-MECP2 region 
captured the underlying causal variant(s) residing in a common risk haplotype 
shared by all four ancestral groups. Among them, rs1059702 best explained the 
Xq28 association signals in conditional testings and exhibited the strongest p 
value in transancestral meta-analysis (p(meta )= 1.3×10(-27), OR=1.43), and thus 
was considered to be the most likely causal variant. The risk allele of 
rs1059702 results in the amino acid substitution S196F in IRAK1 and had 
previously been shown to increase NF-κB activity in vitro. We also found that 
the homozygous risk genotype of rs1059702 was associated with lower mRNA levels 
of MECP2, but not IRAK1, in SLE patients (p=0.0012) and healthy controls 
(p=0.0064).

mediated by the toll-like receptor (TLR)-related pathway was important in the 
development of acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of this study was to determine 
whether common genetic variation in four genes of the TLR signaling pathway were 
associated with sepsis-induced ALI susceptibility and risk of death in Chinese 
Han population.
METHODS: Fourteen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in MyD88, IRAK1, 
IRAK4 and TRAF6 were genotyped in samples of sepsis-induced ALI (n = 272) and 
sepsis alone patients (n = 276), and tested for association in this case-control 
collection. Then, we investigated correlation between the associated SNP and the 
mRNA expression level of the corresponding gene. And we also investigated 
correlation between the associated SNP and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 
as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) ex vivo. The mRNA expression 
level was determined using real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction 
(PCR) assays, and concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6 were measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: The association analysis revealed that rs4755453, an intronic SNP of 
TRAF6, was significantly associated with susceptibility to sepsis-induced ALI. 
The C allele frequency of rs4755453 in the sepsis alone group was significantly 
higher than that in the sepsis-induced ALI group (P = 0.00026, odds ratio (OR) = 
0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.74). These associations remained 
significant after adjustment for covariates in multiple logistic regression 
analysis and for multiple comparisons. TRAF6 mRNA expression levels in PBMCs 
from homozygotes of the rs4755453G allele were significantly higher than that in 
heterozygotes and homozygotes of the rs4755453C allele at baseline (P = 0.012 
and P = 0.003, respectively) as well as after LPS stimulation (P = 0.009 and 
P = 0.005). Moreover, the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6 in cell culture 
supernatants were also significantly higher in the subjects with rs4755453GG 
genotype than in subjects with CG and CC genotype. None of the 14 tagSNPs showed 
associations with risk of death and severity among ALI cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that common genetic variants in TRAF6 were 
significantly associated with susceptibility to sepsis-induced ALI in Chinese

KS, an important AIDS-associated malignancy. KSHV expresses at least 18 
different mature microRNAs (miRNAs). We identified interleukin-1 receptor 
(IL-1R)-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) as a potential target of miR-K12-9 (miR-K9) 
in an array data set examining changes in cellular gene expression levels in the 
presence of KSHV miRNAs. Using 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) luciferase 
reporter assays, we confirmed that miR-K9 and other miRNAs inhibit IRAK1 
expression. In addition, IRAK1 expression is downregulated in cells transfected 
with miR-K9 and during de novo KSHV infection. IRAK1 is an important component 
of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1R signaling cascade. The downregulation of 
IRAK1 by miR-K9 resulted in the decreased stimulation of NF-κB activity in 
endothelial cells treated with IL-1α and in B cells treated with a TLR7/8 
agonist. Interestingly, miR-K9 had a greater effect on NF-κB activity than did a 
small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting IRAK1 despite the more efficient 
downregulation of IRAK1 expression with the siRNA. We hypothesized that KSHV 
miRNAs may also be regulating a second component of the TLR/IL-1R signaling 
cascade, resulting in a stronger phenotype. Reanalysis of the array data set 
identified myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88) as an 
additional potential target. 3'UTR luciferase reporter assays and Western blot 
analysis confirmed the targeting of MYD88 by miR-K5. The presence of miR-K9 and 
miR-K5 inhibited the production of IL-6 and IL-8 upon the IL-1α stimulation of 
endothelial cells. These results demonstrate KSHV-encoded miRNAs regulating the 
TLR/IL-1R signaling cascade at two distinct points and suggest the importance of 
these pathways during viral infection.","DOI: 10.1128/JVI.01147-12

METHODS: IL-33, ST2, p-STAT-6 and perivascular IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 
(p-IRAK1) tissue distribution was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Inducible 
nitric oxide synthase and CD163 were also used by immunohistochemistry to

RESULTS: IFN-γ and IL-33 were significantly overexpressed in the inflamed 
arteries of GCA patients. IL-33 overexpression was not accompanied by a 
concomitant increase of Th2 cytokines. Neovessels scattered through the 
inflammatory infiltrates were the main sites of IL-33 expression. The expression

of animals with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase 
inhibitor, can improve survival in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced severe shock. This study was designed to assess whether SAHA 
affects LPS/Toll-like receptor 4 signaling through acetylation of heat shock 
protein 90 (HSP90) and degradation of its client protein interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1).
METHODS: RAW264.7 cells were exposed to LPS (1 μg/mL) for 2 h, followed by 
treatment with SAHA (10 μM) or geldanamycin (3 μM), an inhibitor of HSP90. Sham 
(no SAHA, no LPS) macrophages served as a control. The cells were harvested at 
different time points, and time zero served as the reference point.
RESULTS: LPS dramatically increased protein expression of myeloid 
differentiation factor 88 and IRAK1, and stimulated nuclear translocation of 
nuclear factor κB, leading to an increases of gene expression and protein 
production of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-6. Treatment with SAHA 
significantly attenuated these LPS-stimulated alterations. LPS or SAHA did not 
change the levels of HSP90 protein, but immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated 
that SAHA treatment enhanced acetylation of HSP90, and increased the 
dissociation of IRAK1, compared to the LPS control.
CONCLUSIONS: SAHA suppresses LPS/Toll-like receptor 4 signaling in 
LPS-stimulated macrophages through multiple potential mechanisms. It inhibits 
the function of HSP90 through hyperacetylation of the chaperone protein, which 
results in dissociation and degradation of the client protein IRAK1 and, at 
least in part, leads to a decrease in nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB 
and attenuation of key proinflammatory cytokine expression.",Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2012.07.023

(NF-κB) activation in the liver, yet the mechanism remains unclear. We 
investigated the modulation and inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced

METHODS: Rats were fed a diet supplemented with or without GGOH for 10 days. 
Rats were then intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 mg/kg LPS or vehicle 
(sterilized saline) and fasted for 18 h. Plasma levels of the inflammatory 
cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, and the 
liver damage indicators alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) 
were assessed. Liver mRNA and proteins were assayed for changes in NF-κB target 
genes and signal transduction genes.
RESULTS: Rats fed a high-dose, GGOH-supplemented diet showed significantly lower 
levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines and ALT and AST activities. In the 
liver, GGOH significantly suppressed NF-κB activation and mRNA expression of its 
pro-inflammatory target genes. Furthermore, GGOH supplementation substantially 
suppressed mRNA expression of signal transducer genes upstream of the IκB kinase 
complex. Western blotting of liver extracts further demonstrated the substantial 
decrease in total IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF

CONCLUSION: A 10-day, high-dose, GGOH-supplemented diet was sufficient to 
inhibit LPS-induced inflammation and activation of NF-κB in rat livers. GGOH 
significantly modulated NF-κB signaling molecules, inhibiting its signal

downstream signaling molecules, TAK1 and p38, a process found essential to 
observe an increased secretion of cytokines by neutrophils activated with TLR

as the role of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) on TNF-α signaling. 
Western blot analysis revealed that TNF-α treatment increased the 
phosphorylation of IRAK1 in hBMSCs. The downregulation of IRAK1 inhibited 
TNF-α-induced NF-ĸB activation and COX-2 expression. TNF-α treatment increased 
hBMSCs proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and increased ERK, JNK, and 
NF-ĸB activity. U0126, an ERK inhibitor, decreased hBMSCs proliferation and 
significantly blocked TNF-α -induced hBMSCs proliferation. In cells with IRAK1 
or TRADD downregulation, the U0126 treatment inhibited hBMSCs proliferation and 
significantly suppressed TNF-α-induced hBMSCs proliferation. The downregulation 
of IRAK1 or TRADD inhibited TNF-α-induced ERK and JNK activation, and hBMSCs 
proliferation. Inhibition of NF-ĸB by decoy oligonucleotides reduced the 
TNF-α-induced hBMSCs proliferation. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that 
IRAK1 does not physically interact with TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) even in the 
presence of TNF-α. Suppression of IRAK1 binding protein (IRAK1BP1) inhibited 
TNF-α-induced increase of the proliferation and ERK1 phosphorylation of hBMSCs 
in the presence of TNF-α. Our data indicate that TNF-α modulates hBMSCs 
proliferation through ERK signaling pathways, and that IRAK1 plays an important

genes and the environment. Genetic and environmental differences are attributed 
to the heterogeneity of the disease pathway and to the epigenetic modifications 
that lead to altered gene expression in the diseased tissues. The epigenetic 
machinery consists of short interfering RNA, histone modifications, and DNA 
methylation. We evaluated the effects of Bifidobacterium breve (DSMZ 20213) and 
LGG (ATCC 53103), as representatives of commensal probiotics on the expression 
of IL-17 and IL-23, which play an important role in IBD, and on the epigenetic 
machinery in a 3D coculture model composed of human intestinal HT-29/B6 or T84 
cells and PBMCs. The cells were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of 
bacteria for 48 h, and the expression of IL-17, IL-23, and CD40 at the mRNA and 
protein levels was assessed using TaqMan qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. 
Western blotting was used to assess the expression of the MyD88, the degradation 
of IRAK-1 and IκBα, the expression of the NF-κB p50/p65 subunits, the p-p38 MAPK 
and p-MEK1, as well as histone modifications. NF-κB activity was assessed by 
NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene assays. The accumulation of Ac-H4 and 
DNA methylation was quantitatively assessed using colorimetric assays. B. breve 
and LGG diminished the LPS-induced expression of IL-17, IL-23, CD40, and histone 
acetylation, while slightly enhancing DNA methylation. These effects were 
paralleled by a decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, as demonstrated 
by a decrease in the expression of MyD88, degradation of IRAK-1 and IκBα 
expression of the nuclear NF-κB p50/p65 subunits, p-p38 MAPK and p-MEK1, and 
NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene activity in LPS-stimulated cells. B. 
breve and LGG may exert their anti-inflammatory effects in the gut by 
down-regulating the expression of the IBD-causing factors (IL-23/IL-17/CD40) 
associated with epigenetic processes involving the inhibition of histone 
acetylation and the optimal enhancement of DNA methylation, reflected in the 
limited access of NF-κB to gene promoters and reduced NF-κB-mediated 
transcriptional activation. We describe a new regulatory mechanism in which 
commensal probiotics inhibit the NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activation of 
IBD-causing factors (IL-23/IL-17/CD40), thereby simultaneously reducing histone

LPS-induced Lys-63-linked IRAK1 ubiquitination with reduced Lys-48-linked IRAK1 
ubiquitination. Furthermore, Pellino 2 is required for TAK1-dependent NFκB 
activation. However, because of the retained TAK1-independent NFκB activation, 
the levels of IL-1- and LPS-induced NFκB activation were not substantially 
affected in Pellino 2 knockdown 293-IL-1R cells and primary macrophages, 
respectively. On the other hand, Pellino 2 knockdown reduced the IL-1- and

accompanied by increased decay rates of the mRNAs of the inflammatory genes.

pretreatment inhibited LPS-induced NFκB DNA binding activity as well as IκBα and 
IKKβ (IκB kinase β) phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation was also inhibited by 
bLF pretreatment. However, bLF pretreatment failed to block the degradation of 
IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1), which is an essential event 
after its activation. Remarkably, we found that bLF pretreatment inhibited 
LPS-mediated Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of TNF receptor-associated factor

(lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1) and intracellular distributed bLF binds 
to endogenous TRAF6. In addition, bLF inhibited IL-1β- and flagellin-induced 
TRAF6-dependent activation of the NFκB signaling pathway. Collectively, our 
findings demonstrate that bLF inhibits NFκB and MAP kinase activation, which 
play critical roles in chronic inflammatory disease by interfering with the

Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.","The neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a critical 
inflammatory mediator persistently induced during endotoxemia, contributing to 
tubular damage and kidney failure. The intracellular process responsible for 
persistent induction of LCN2 by bacterial endotoxin Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is 
not well understood. Using primary kidney fibroblasts, we observed that 
LPS-induced LCN2 expression requires a coupled circuit involving an early 
transient phase of AP-1 path and a late persistent phase of C/EBPδ path, both of 
which are dependent upon the interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 
(IRAK-1). Using immunoprecipitation analysis we observed transient binding of 
AP-1 to the promoters of both TNFα and C/ebpδ. On the other hand, we only 
observed persistent binding of C/EBPδ to its own promoter but not on TNFα. 
Blockage of new protein synthesis using cyclohexamide significantly reduced the 
expression of C/EBPδ as well as LCN2. By chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, 
we demonstrated that LPS recruited C/EBPδ to the Lcn2 promoter in WT, but not 
IRAK-1 deficient fibroblasts. A differential equation-based computational model 
captured the dynamic circuit leading to the persistent induction of LCN2. In 
vivo, we observed elevated levels of LCN2 in kidneys harvested from LPS-injected 
WT mice as compared to IRAK-1 deficient mice. Taken together, this study has 
identified an integrated intracellular network involved in the persistent 
induction of LCN2 by LPS.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034633

signaling, but its roles in regulation of responses of human cells to human 
pathogens are unknown. We investigated the potential roles of Pellino-1 in the 
airways. We show for the first time that Pellino-1 regulates responses to a 
human pathogen, rhinovirus minor group serotype 1B (RV-1B). Knockdown of 
Pellino-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with impaired 
production of innate immune cytokines such as CXCL8 from human primary bronchial 
epithelial cells in response to RV-1B, without impairment in production of 
antiviral interferons (IFN), and without loss of control of viral replication. 
Pellino-1 actions were likely to be independent of interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) regulation, since Pellino-1 knockdown in 
primary epithelial cells did not alter responses to IL-1 but did inhibit 
responses to poly(I·C), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activator that does not 
signal via IRAK-1 to engender a response. These data indicate that Pellino-1 
represents a novel target that regulates responses of human airways to human 
viral pathogens, independently of IRAK signaling. Neutralization of Pellino-1 
may therefore provide opportunities to inhibit potentially harmful neutrophilic 
inflammation of the airways induced by respiratory viruses, without loss of 
control of the underlying viral infection.","DOI: 10.1128/JVI.06755-11

mortality by activating innate and adaptive immune signaling cascades that 
stimulate HIV-1 replication, leading to an increase in viral load. Here, we 
demonstrate that silencing of the expression of the transcription factor nuclear 
factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb)-stimulated HIV-1 replication in co-infected 
macrophages. We show that NFAT5 gene and protein expression are strongly induced 
by MTb, which is a Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, and that an intact NFAT5

molecular clones is required for efficent induction of HIV-1 replication by MTb. 
Furthermore, silencing by RNAi of key components of the TLR pathway in human 
monocytes, including the downstream signaling molecules MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6, 
significantly inhibits MTb-induced NFAT5 gene expression. Thus, the innate 
immune response to MTb infection induces NFAT5 gene and protein expression, and 
NFAT5 plays a crucial role in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication via a direct

the infection of human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. However, little 
is known about the regulation of macrophages TLR signalling by the infection of 
lethal or non-lethal strain of rodent malaria parasites.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were infected with non-lethal strain Plasmodium yoelii 
17XNL or lethal strain P. yoelii 17XL. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated to 
study its immune response to pRBC lysate, and TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9) 
agonists, and the expression of TLRs and intracellular signalling molecules were 
also investigated by flow cytometry and semi-quantitive RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The reactivity of peritoneal macrophages from the mice infected with 
lethal strain P. y 17XL or non-lethal strain P. y 17XNL were enhanced to pRBC 
lysate, and TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 agonists at one, three and five days 
post-infection. Of all the tested TLRs, only TLR2 was up-regulated on peritoneal 
macrophages of mice infected with either strain. However, transcription of 
intracellular signalling molecules MyD88, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6 was significantly 
up-regulated in peritoneal macrophages from mice infected either with P. yoelii 
17XL or P. yoelii 17XNL at one, three and five days post-infection. However, the 
enhanced TLRs response of macrophage from P. yoelii 17XNL-infected mice 
persisted for a much longer time than that from P. yoelii 17XL-infected mice.
CONCLUSION: Both P. yoelii 17XL and 17XNL strains could enhance the response of 
peritoneal macrophages to pRBC lysate and TLR agonists, through up-regulating 
the expression of TLR2 and intracellular signalling molecules MyD88, IRAK-1, and 
TRAF-6. In addition, prolonged high response of macrophage from P. yoelii 
17XNL-infected mice might be associated with the more efficiently controlling of 
P. yoelii 17XNL growth in mice at early stage.","DOI: 10.1186/1475-2875-11-104

effects of treatment of several inflammatory disorders with anakinra, which is 
an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, have also been reported. Both

systematically analyzed the expression, correlation, and regulation of IL-1rn

different splicing, interaction with genomic background of individuals, and 
environmental factors affect function of IL-1rn. At present, our knowledge on

(1)Atherosclerosis and Metabolism Unit, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences,

associated with obesity-related inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin 
resistance. Globular adiponectin is an important regulator of the interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)/NFκB pathway in monocytes of obese subjects. 
It protects against inflammation and oxidative stress by inducing IRAK3. 
microRNA (miR)-146b-5p inhibits NFκB-mediated inflammation by targeted 
repression of IRAK1 and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6). Therefore, we 
measured the expression of miR-146b-5p in monocytes of obese subjects. Because 
it was low we determined the involvement of this miR in the anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidative and insulin signaling action of globular adiponectin.
METHODS: miR-146b-5p expression in monocytes of obese subjects was determined by 
qRT-PCR. The effect of miR-146b-5p silencing on molecular markers of 
inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin signaling and the association with 
globular adiponectin was assessed in human THP-1 monocytes.
RESULTS: miR-146b-5p was downregulated in monocytes of obese persons. Low 
globular adiponectin decreased miR-146b-5p and IRAK3 in THP-1 monocytes, 
associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
Intracellular ROS and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) protein were 
unchanged. Silencing of miR-146b-5p with an antisense inhibitor resulted in 
increased expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6 leading to more NFκB p65 DNA binding 
activity and TNFα. As a response IRAK3 and IRS1 protein increased. Mitochondrial 
and intracellular ROS production did not increase despite more inflammation. In 
addition, exposure of miR-146b-5p-depleted THP-1 monocytes to high levels of 
globular adiponectin resulted in an increased production of TNFα and 
intracellular ROS. Still, they did not lose their potential to increase IRAK3 
and IRS1 protein and to decrease mitochondrial ROS.
CONCLUSION: miR-146b-5p, decreased in monocytes during obesity, is a major 
mediator of the anti-inflammatory action of globular adiponectin. It appears not 
to be involved in insulin signaling possibly by protective response of IRAK3 and 
lack of mitochondrial ROS production.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032794

inflammation and prostate cancer was declared some years ago. As Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs) are the key players in the processes of chronic intraprostatic 
inflammation, there is a hypothesis that TLR gene polymorphisms may be 
associated with prostate cancer risk. Although a number of comprehensive studies 
have been conducted on large samples in various countries, reliable connections 
between these single nucleotide polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk, stage, 
grade, aggressiveness, ability to metastasize, and mortality have not been 
detected. Results have also varied slightly in different populations. The data 
obtained regarding the absence of connection between the polymorphisms of the 
genes encoding interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAK1 and IRAK4) and 
prostate cancer risk might indicate a lack of association between inherited 
variation in the TLR signaling pathway and prostate cancer risk. It is possible 
to consider that polymorphisms of genes encoding TLRs and proteins of the TLR 
pathway also do not play a major role in the etiology and pathogenesis of 
prostate cancer. Feasibly, it would be better to focus research on associations 
between TLR single nucleotide polymorphisms and cancer risk in other 
infection-related cancer types.","DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S28683

infiltrating atherosclerotic lesions they accumulate oxLDL (oxidized low density 
lipoproteins) and differentiate into foam cells. During this process inhibition 
of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4)-dependent IFNβ expression occurs. To understand 
molecular mechanisms how oxLDL inhibits LPS-induced IFNβ expression in 
macrophage-derived foam cells, we analyzed the impact of oxLDL on signaling 
pathways upstream of IFNβ expression. We identified mono-ubiquitination of TANK 
(TRAF family member-associated NFκB activator), a scaffold protein of the TRIF 
(TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFNβ)-dependent TLR4-signaling cascade. 
Modified TANK inhibits recruitment of TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) to TRAF3 (TNF 
receptor associated factor 3) and the subsequent activation of the transcription 
factor IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3). OxLDL stimulates TANK 
mono-ubiquitination by subsequent activation of IRAK1/4 (interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4) and Pellino3 downstream of SR-A1 (scavenger 
receptor-A1). Our observations highlight the regulatory impact of IRAK1/4 and 
Pellino3 on the TRIF-dependent TLR4-signaling cascade, which might be of general 
importance for disease conditions associated with macrophage pathologies such as 
atherosclerosis.",Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.01.021

(1)Brain and Spinal Injury Center, University of California, San Francisco, 
California, USA.","BACKGROUND: Chronic neuroinflammation is a hallmark of several neurological 
disorders associated with cognitive loss. Activated microglia and secreted 
factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are key mediators of 
neuroinflammation and may contribute to neuronal dysfunction. Our study was 
aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a novel analog of thalidomide, 
3,6'-dithiothalidomide (DT), an agent with anti-TNF-α activity, in a model of 
chronic neuroinflammation.
METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide or artificial cerebrospinal fluid was infused into 
the fourth ventricle of three-month-old rats for 28 days. Starting on day 29, 
animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of DT (56 mg/kg/day) or 
vehicle for 14 days. Thereafter, cognitive function was assessed by novel object 
recognition, novel place recognition and Morris water maze, and animals were 
euthanized 25 min following water maze probe test evaluation.
RESULTS: Chronic LPS-infusion was characterized by increased gene expression of 
the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in the hippocampus. Treatment with 
DT normalized TNF-α levels back to control levels but not IL-1β. Treatment with 
DT attenuated the expression of TLR2, TLR4, IRAK1 and Hmgb1, all genes involved 
in the TLR-mediated signaling pathway associated with classical microglia 
activation. However DT did not impact the numbers of MHC Class II immunoreactive 
cells. Chronic neuroinflammation impaired novel place recognition, spatial 
learning and memory function; but it did not impact novel object recognition. 
Importantly, treatment with DT restored cognitive function in LPS-infused 
animals and normalized the fraction of hippocampal neurons expressing the 
plasticity-related immediate-early gene Arc.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that the TNF-α synthesis inhibitor DT can 
significantly reverse hippocampus-dependent cognitive deficits induced by 
chronic neuroinflammation. These results suggest that TNF-α is a critical 
mediator of chronic neuroinflammation-induced neuronal dysfunction and cognitive 
impairment and targeting its synthesis could provide an effective therapeutic 
approach to several human neurodegenerative diseases.","DOI: 10.1186/1742-2094-9-23
