the diagnostic trajectory in the electronic health record (EHR).
METHODS: We applied a conceptual model to delineate the diagnostic trajectory of 
Mendelian disease to the EHRs of patients affected by one of nine Mendelian 
diseases. We assessed data availability and phenotype ascertainment across the 
diagnostic trajectory using phenotype risk scores (PheRS) and validated our 
findings via chart review of patients with hereditary connective tissue 
disorders.
RESULTS: We identified 896 individuals with genetically confirmed diagnoses, 216 
(24%) of whom had fully ascertained diagnostic trajectories. PheRS increased 
following clinical suspicion and diagnosis (p<1x10-4, Wilcoxon rank sum test). 
We found that of all ICD-based phenotypes in the EHR, 66% were recorded after 
clinical suspicion, and manual chart review yielded consistent results.
CONCLUSION: Using a novel conceptual model to study the diagnostic trajectory of 
genetic disease in the EHR, we demonstrated that phenotype ascertainment is, in 
large part, driven by the clinical exams and studies prompted by clinical 
suspicion of a genetic disease, a process we term diagnostic convergence. 
Algorithms designed to detect undiagnosed genetic disease should consider 
censoring EHR data at the first date of clinical suspicion to avoid data 
leakage.",Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.gim.2023.100921

cardiovascular events. The aim was to investigate the effect of timing of fixed 
dose triple antihypertensive combinations on blood pressure (BP) control.
METHODS: One hundred sixteen consecutive patients (62.7 ± 10.7 years, 38 men) 
with grade II hypertension were randomized into four groups. Group 1 and Group 2 
patients were given angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-based triple 
antihypertensive pills to be taken in the morning or evening, respectively while 
Group 3 and Group 4 patients were given angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) based 
triple antihypertensive pills to be taken in the morning or evening, 
respectively. All patients underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring 1 month after 
the initiation of treatment.
RESULTS: There were not any significant differences in the characteristics, BP 
values and loads among groups. All patients in each group had good BP control. 
Dipping pattern in systolic BP was observed significantly less in Group 3 
patients taking ARB in the morning (3 patients) compared to other groups (12 
patients) in each group, [P = .025]. Similarly, dipping pattern in diastolic BP 
was observed significantly less in Group 3 patients (4 patients) compared to 
others (13 patients) in Group 1 and 15 patients in Group 2 and Group 4, 
[P = .008]. Nondipping pattern was significantly associated with taking ARB in 
the morning, even when adjusted by age, sex, and other comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: Fixed dose triple antihypertensive drug combinations enable good BP 
control regardless of the timing of drug while ARB-based ones may be taken in 
the evening to ensure dipping physiology.","DOI: 10.1080/10641963.2023.2224941

their potentials as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors with 
anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-DPP4 effects of these analogs were evaluated 
using the fluorescent substrate Gly-Pro-N-butyl-4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide 
(GP-BAN). The nitro-substituted analogue 27 exhibited the most potent activity 
(Ki = 0.96 μM). A structure-activity relationship investigation revealed that 
4-hydroxyl and 5-chloro substituents are essential for DPP4 inhibition, while 
the 3'-nitro substituent improved both DPP4 inhibition and microsomal stability. 
Furthermore, compound 27 demonstrated good selectivity for DPP4 over other 
proteases, including dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), thrombin, prolyl 
endopeptidase (PREP), and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). The cytotoxic 
effect of 27 was evaluated in cancer cell lines HepG-2 and Caco-2 and in somatic 
RAW264.7 cells and RPTECs. Compound 27 showed no toxicity to normal cells and 
weak toxicity to cancer cells. In a living cell imaging assay, 27 blocked the 
dipeptidase activity of DPP4 in both Caco-2 and HepG-2 cells. This compound also 
dose-dependently suppressed the expression levels of the chemokines tumor

been increasing year by year, it is necessary to adopt simple and valid measures 
to evaluate the health status of elderly patients with hypertension to reduce 
the heavy burden faced by this group.
METHOD: This study is a cross-sectional analysis. Participants aged at least 
65 years were included. Self-Rated Health (SRH) assessment of respondents was 
classified into two groups: participants who responded as ""very good"" and ""good"" 
were considered as having good SRH, and participants who answered as ""average,"" 
""poor,"" and ""very poor"" were considered as having poor SRH. Chi-square tests 
were used to determine differences in patient characteristics between the two 
groups. Binary logistic regression models were used to identify factors 
associated with SRH.
RESULTS: The results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that having a 
spouse, better economic status, exercise, eating fruits and vegetables, 
nighttime sleep of 7 to 9 hours, good living environment, interaction with 
friends, and hypertension with comorbidity such as diabetes mellitus, heart 
disease, stroke or hyperlipidemia were influencing factors of SRH (P < .05). 
Another finding was that alcohol use significantly affected SRH (P < .05). 
Depression, anxiety, and community nursing services did not figure as 
determinants of health in this group.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide evidence for the need to develop 
effective health promotion programs for the well-being of hypertensive patients.","DOI: 10.1080/10641963.2023.2224942

(PRO) instruments prior to use in pivotal clinical studies, which may then be 
used to generate critical patient-centered evidence and support labelling 
claims. This targeted literature review aimed to determine if PRO instruments 
psychometrically validated in a phase 3 trial setting could support label claims 
from the same phase 3 study (i.e., PRO data were generated as an endpoint).
METHODS: A targeted search of published studies (01 January 2006 - 03 June 2021) 
using the MEDLINE database identified PRO instruments validated during phase 3 
trials. The search included instrument terms (e.g., patient-reported outcome 
measures, questionnaire, survey) and validation terms (e.g., reproducibility, 
minimal important difference), without filtering for therapeutic indications. 
Results were limited to phase 3 clinical trials or validation studies. The 
PROLABELS database was used to identify PROs validated in phase 3 trials and 
accepted in labelling claims.
RESULTS: Of 355 references identified, 68 studies with PRO psychometric 
validation in phase 3 studies were selected, covering 78 instruments. Of these, 
20 were novel PRO instruments and 58 were existing instruments being validated 
for a new therapeutic indication/population. The psychometric properties most 
frequently validated were internal consistency reliability, known-group 
validity, responsiveness, minimal important difference, and concurrent validity. 
Five novel instruments obtained ten labelling claims for seven drugs/products.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that quantitative validation of novel PRO 
instruments, and existing PROs for new indications, can occur within the context 
of phase 3 trials, and these PROs can also support label claims.","DOI: 10.1080/03007995.2023.2224164

produced by a customised eruption guidance appliance (EGA) and a preformed EGA 
in subjects presenting a skeletal class II pattern during early mixed dentition 
and to evaluate the differences between the two devices.
METHODS: All subjects included in the study were randomly selected from the 
record's archive according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients 
presenting upper central incisor and first permanent molars fully erupted; (2) 
early mixed dentition with age between 7 to 9 years old; (3) Angle class I or 
class II malocclusion; (4) increased overjet > 4 mm;(5) deep bite with at least 
2/3 overlapping of the incisors; (6) no previous orthodontic treatment apart 
from maxillary expansion treatment. All children belonging to the case group 
received treatment with a 3D printed EGA whereas the other patients belonging to 
the control group were treated with preformed EGA. Records consisted in digital 
dental models and lateral cephalogram at the beginning (T0) and after 1 year of 
treatment (T1). Data collected on the digital models included the dentoalveolar 
changes in overbite, overjet, sagittal molar relationship, and dental crowding. 
Cephalometric tracings were computed by a single blinded observer using Dolphin 
Imaging software. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (version 25.00; 
IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Comparison regarding the cephalometric changes between 
T1-T2 was carried out with paired t-test. Difference in distribution regarding 
sagittal molar and canine relationship and anterior crowding between groups at 
T1 and T2 has been computed with chi-square test. The independent sample t-test 
was used to perform the between group comparison.
CONCLUSION: In the short time, both the appliances showed to be effective in 
correcting class II malocclusion, anterior crowding, overjet and overbite. 
Custom-made appliance demonstrated to be significantly more effective in 
correcting anterior crowding, the dento-skeletal vertical relation and position 
of permanent incisor compared to the preformed appliance. Adopting a customised 
device, effects due to an average prescription appliance used to a specific 
patient can be reduced, resulting in more predictable results.","DOI: 10.23804/ejpd.2023.1727

factors and anthropogenic effects, which in some cases include domestication. 
The grey wolf was once widely distributed across the Holarctic, but experienced 
phylogeographic shifts and demographic declines during the Holocene. In the 
19th-20th centuries, the species became extirpated from large parts of Europe 
due to direct extermination and habitat loss. We reconstructed the evolutionary 
history of the extinct Western European wolves based on the mitogenomic 
composition of 78 samples from France (Neolithic-20th century) in the context of 
other populations of wolves and dogs worldwide. We found a close genetic 
similarity of French wolves from ancient, medieval and recent populations, which 
suggests the long-term continuity of maternal lineages. MtDNA haplotypes of the 
French wolves showed large diversity and fell into two main haplogroups of 
modern Holarctic wolves. Our worldwide phylogeographic analysis indicated that 
haplogroup W1, which includes wolves from Eurasia and North America, originated 
in Northern Siberia. Haplogroup W2, which includes only European wolves, 
originated in Europe ~35 kya and its frequency was reduced during the Holocene 
due to an expansion of haplogroup W1 from the east. Moreover, we found that dog 
haplogroup D, currently restricted to Europe and the Middle East, was nested 
within the wolf haplogroup W2. This suggests European origin of haplogroup D, 
probably as a result of an ancient introgression from European wolves. Our 
results highlight the dynamic evolutionary history of European wolves during the 
Holocene, with a partial lineage replacement and introgressive hybridization 
with local dog populations.",© 2023 The Authors. Molecular Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/mec.17054

association between genetic polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC), more 
research is required to comprehend the molecular mechanisms of CRC. In the 
present study, we investigated the association between lncRNA HOTAIR rs2366152 
and rs1899663 polymorphisms with CRC susceptibility in the Iranian population.
METHODS: This case-control study consisting of 187 CRC patients and 200 healthy 
samples. The tetra-amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain 
reaction (Tetra-ARMS-PCR) technique was used for the genotyping of rs2366152 and

RESULTS: The findings showed that the AG genotype of the rs2366152 polymorphism 
has a protective effect on CRC susceptibility (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.94, 
p-value = 0.023). Furthermore, rs2366152 polymorphism associated with CRC risk 
in an over dominant inheritance model (p-value = 0.0089). According to the 
outcomes of the rs1899663 polymorphism, the GT genotype had protective effects 
on CRC risk (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35-0.86, p-value = 0.008). Moreover, 
statistical analysis has shown that the rs1899663 polymorphism was associated 
with CRC risk in dominant (p-value = 0.013) and overdominant (p-value = 0.0086)

(OMPs) through several mechanisms, including inner filter effect, competition 
with the target OMP, and radical scavenging, during synchronous 
adsorption/photocatalysis of multi-functional composites. In this study, the 
fate and inhibitory mechanisms of sulfamerazine (SMZ, a model OMP) that occurred 
in presence of seven different NOM samples (i.e., three standard NOM surrogates, 
a river water sample, a carbon filter effluent and two different sand filter 
effluents) during the adsorption/photocatalysis by a composite of Bi2O3-TiO2 
supported on powdered activated carbon (Bi2O3-TiO2/PAC, abbreviated as BTP) when 
exposed to visible light irradiation were revealed. The results indicated that 
adsorption played a greater attribution than photocatalysis on SMZ removal. The 
primary impediment to the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of SMZ was 
attributed to the presence of terrestrial-derived, humic-like NOM fractions with 
a high aromaticity. The adsorption efficacy of SMZ was weakened by the 
absorption of NOM and its degradation products onto the BTP surface. The inner 
filter effect, competition between NOM and SMZ, and radical scavenging were 
responsible for the reduced photocatalysis of SMZ. In the cases of real water

trampolining, assessed in training by maximal jump tests. The aim of this study 
was to assess the relationship between physical floor based performance meaures 
and 20-maximum ToF. Thirty two elite level gymnasts (13 senior; 19 junior) 
performed a battery of floor based tests and a 20-maximum jump test. Floor based 
tests included cycling peak power output, reactive strength index (RSI), 
unloaded countermovement jumps (CMJ), and loaded CMJ's to construct a 
load-velocity profile for prediction of theoretical maximum force (CMJ F0). Very 
large and large, positive bivariate relationships were observed between CMJ F0 
and ToF for the seniors (r = 0.85) and juniors (r = 0.56), respectively. Very 
large, positive bivariate relationships were observed between CMJ height and 
total ToF for both seniors (r = 0.74) and juniors (r = 0.77). Step-wise multiple 
regression analyses revealed CMJ F0 predicted 72% of ToF variability between 
seniors, and CMJ height (59%), 10 to 5 RSI (13%), and CMJ F0 (10%) predicting 
82% of ToF variability between juniors. This suggests CMJ F0, lower limb maximal 
isometric capabilities, and CMJ height are important floor based predictors of 
maximal ToF in elite gymnasts.","DOI: 10.1080/17461391.2023.2227128

However, it has also been described in many of their fossil ancestors. 
Craniogenetic studies show that it is composed of two types of bone: first, the 
cartilaginous ala orbitalis and parts of the trabecular plate are transformed by 
endochondral ossification; second, so-called 'appositional bone' 
('Zuwachsknochen') arises directly from the perichondrium of the two optic pilae 
and spreads in all directions and overlays the remaining cartilage and the 
endochondral ossifications. For some time, both bone types can be distinguished 
microscopically, but later in craniogenesis they fuse completely to become the 
presphenoid sensu lato of the osteocranium. We interpret the 'appositional bone' 
as neomorphic mode to reinforce the endocranial bone structures, which are the 
ossification of the delicate cartilaginous template of the chondrocranium. We 
studied the ossifications of the presphenoidal skull region in a series of 
ontogenetic stages of the pig Sus scrofa. We applied conventional histology as 
well as stained and unstained μCT scans. We can show the above-mentioned modes 
of ossification, and we can demonstrate the contribution of 'appositional bone' 
well into neonatal and infantile stages. The ossifications of the presphenoid 
(including the orbitosphenoid) are very slender in therapsids and early 
mammaliaforms as previously described by other authors. In mammaliaforms, they 
tend to become thicker and closely connected with the frontal bone, which may be 
due to the contribution of neomorphic appositional bone. We assume that thereby 
the presphenoid sensu lato becomes an enforcement of the orbital pillars.","© 2023 The Authors. The Anatomical Record published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on

because its pathophysiology is still not well understood. Therefore, we 
investigated if bioelectrical phase angle (PhA), a non-invasive marker of cell 
integrity, could help to single out specific fatigue subtypes. In a randomized 
controlled strength training intervention trial, PhA was measured by 
bioelectrical impedance analysis in 158 breast cancer patients. Fatigue was 
assessed with the multidimensional 20-item Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire. 
Multiple regression analyses considering changes in PhA and fatigue from 
baseline to post-intervention and ANCOVA models investigating the strength 
training effect on PhA were conducted. Further, explorative mediation and 
moderation analyses were performed. Decrease (=worsening) in PhA was 
significantly associated with increase in physical (P = .010) and emotional 
(P = .019) fatigue. These associations were markedly stronger in patients with 
normal BMI (interaction P = .059 and .097) and with low pre-diagnosis exercise 
level (interaction P = .058 and .19). Among patients with normal BMI strength 
training was associated with an increase in PhA (ANCOVA P = .059), but not among 
overweight/obese patients (interaction P = .035). Chemotherapy was a major 
determinant for low PhA, but PhA did not mediate the effect of chemotherapy on 
fatigue. In conclusion, PhA has a significant inverse association with physical 
and emotional fatigue. This association is moderated by BMI and previous 
exercise. Significant relationships of PhA were also observed with chemotherapy 
and strength training. Thus, PhA might be a marker that could help in the 
classification of subtypes of fatigue with different pathophysiology, which may 
require specifically tailored treatment. Further research on this is warranted.","© 2023 The Authors. International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley &

important hormone regulating mineral metabolism. Previous studies reported that 
high sodium diet will cause the increase in serum PTH, but the specific 
mechanism is unknown. Consequently, the present study aims to investigate the 
effects and mechanisms of high sodium on PTH synthesis and secretion from PTGs. 
We developed a tissue culture model using normal rat PTGs, discovered that 
sodium elicited and promoted concentration-dependent and time-dependent PTH 
secretion. Changes in sodium-associated transporters from PTGs incubated with 
high sodium were thoroughly examined. Increased expression of sodium-phosphate 
cotransporter Slc20a1 (also known as PiT-1) was observed. Further tests revealed 
that PiT-1 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in increased IKKβ 
phosphorylation, IKBα degradation, and increased p65 phosphorylation followed by 
nuclear entry, which led to increased PTH transcription. Meanwhile, IKKβ 
phosphorylated SNAP23, promoting exocytosis and eventually led to increased PTH 
secretion. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PiT-1 plays an important 
role in the increased secretion and synthesis of PTH directly induced by high 
sodium under physiological conditions, and may provide a potential therapeutic 
target for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).","© 2023 The Author(s). Published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the

gariepinus, the African sharptooth catfish. Light microscopy (LM), transmission

the TCs. TCs had a cell body and telopodes which formed 3D networks in the 
cartilage canals and extended their telopodes to become the foremost cellular 
elements penetrating the cartilage matrix. The TCs were also rich in lysosomes 
that secreted products to the extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, TCs 
formed a homocellular synaptic-like structure that had a synaptic cleft, and the

irregular contour when migrating rather than exhibiting an extended profile. 
Migrating TCs additionally had ill-defined cell bodies, condensed chromatin, 
thickened telopodes, and podoms which were closely attached to the cell body. 
The TCs also expressed markers for MMP-9, CD117, CD34 and RhoA. In conclusion,

symptoms, big-five personality traits, and psychological distress. However, 
limited research has explored these relationships as a network, including their 
interconnections, and even less has done so in non-Western populations. We 
employed network analysis to investigate the co-occurrence of disordered eating 
symptoms, big-five personality traits, and psychological distress in Chinese 
adults.
METHOD: A sample of 500 Chinese adults (256 men) completed measures assessing 
big-five personality traits, psychological distress, and disordered eating 
symptoms. The network of personality traits, psychological distress, and 
disordered eating symptoms was estimated, including its central and bridge 
nodes.
RESULTS: The central nodes in the network were the facets of openness (like 
adventure), extraversion (like going to social and recreational parties), and 
disordered eating symptoms (dissatisfaction with body weight or shape). 
Moreover, certain facets of neuroticism (always worrying something bad will 
happen), psychological distress (feeling worthless), and an inverse facet of 
extraversion (bored by parties with lots of people) were identified as essential 
bridge nodes in maintaining the structure of the network.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that personality traits (e.g., openness and 
extraversion) and body dissatisfaction are important in maintaining the network 
in a community sample of Chinese adults. While future replication is needed, 
findings from this study suggest that individuals with negative self-thinking, 
predisposed neuroticism, and extraversion may be at risk of developing 
disordered eating symptoms.
PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: The present study contributes to existing knowledge by 
employing a network perspective to examine the associations between disordered 
eating symptoms, big-five personality traits, and psychological distress in a 
Chinese adult community sample. The identified facets of neuroticism and 
extraversion and symptoms of psychological distress may be worthy of targeting 
in the prevention and treatment of disordered eating in the Chinese context.",© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/eat.24012

characterized as randomly disseminated, innumerable, and small metastatic 
nodules, has been considered as being poor. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the clinical characteristics and survival of MPM in patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: This retrospective study included NSCLC patients with MPM and 
nonmiliary pulmonary metastases (NMPM) detected during staging evaluation 
between 2000 and 2020. MPM was defined as >50 bilaterally distributed metastatic 
pulmonary nodules (<1 cm in diameter), and NMPM was defined as the presence of 
≤15 metastatic pulmonary nodules regardless of size. Baseline characteristics, 
genetic alterations and overall survival (OS) rates were compared between the 
two groups.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with MPM and 78 patients with NMPM were analyzed. 
The median number of patients who smoked was significantly lower in the MPM 
group than in the NMPM group (0 vs. 8 pack years, p = 0.030). The frequency of 
EGFR mutation was significantly higher in the MPM group (58%) than in the NMPM 
group (24%; p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in 5-year OS between 
the MPM and the NMPM group by the log-rank test (p = 0.900).
CONCLUSION: MPM in NSCLC were significantly related to EGFR mutation. The OS 
rate of the MPM group was not inferior to that of the NMPM group. The presence 
of EGFR mutations should be thoroughly evaluated for NSCLC patients with initial 
presentation of MPM.","© 2023 The Authors. Thoracic Cancer published by China Lung Oncology Group and

squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a considerable number of patients still 
experience relapse due to resistance. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the 
effects of cetuximab on radiosensitivity in two ESCC cell lines (ECA109 and 
TE-13) and to investigate their underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Cells were pretreated with or without cetuximab before irradiation. The 
MTT assay and clonogenic survival assay were performed to evaluate cell 
viability and radiosensitivity. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze cell 
cycle distribution and apoptosis. The γH2AX foci were counted to determine 
cellular DNA-repairing capacity via immunofluorescence assay. The 
phosphorylation of key molecules involved in the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair were 
measured by western blot.
RESULTS: Cetuximab alone was not sufficient to suppress cell viability, but 
significantly enhanced radiation-induced inhibition of clonogenic survival in 
ECA109 and TE-13. The radiation sensitivity enhancement ratio (SER) was 1.341 
and 1.237 for ECA109 and TE-13, respectively. ESCC cells treated with cetuximab 
were arrested at the G2/M phase in response to radiation. No significant 
increase in apoptotic rate was observed in irradiated cells that were treated 
with cetuximab. The average number of γH2AX foci increased in the combination 
group (cetuximab and radiation). Cetuximab suppressed phosphorylation of EGFR 
and downstream ERK, but had no significant effect on AKT.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the potential for use of cetuximab as an 
effective radiosensitizer in ESCC. Cetuximab promotes G2/M cycle arrest and 
reduces DSB repair, as well as inhibiting EGFR and downstream ERK pathways in 
ESCC.","© 2023 The Authors. Thoracic Cancer published by China Lung Oncology Group and

(#)Contributed equally","Multidrug resistance Candida auris is a dangerous fungal pathogen that is 
emerging at an alarming rate and posing serious threats to public health. 
C. auris is associated with nosocomial infections that cause invasive 
candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Several antifungal drugs with 
distinct mechanisms of action are clinically approved for the treatment of 
fungal infections. The high rates of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance, 
particularly to azoles, reported in characterized clinical isolates of C. auris 
make treatment extremely problematic. In systemic infections, azoles are the 
first-line treatment for most Candida species; however, the increasing use of 
drugs results in the frequent emergence of drug resistance. More than 90% of the 
clinical isolates of C. auris is shown to be highly resistant to azole drugs 
especially fluconazole, with some strains (types) resistant to all three classes 
of commonly used antifungals. This presents a huge challenge for researchers in 
terms of completely understanding the molecular mechanism of azole resistance to 
develop more efficient drugs. Due to the scarcity of C. auris therapeutic 
alternatives, the development of successful drug combinations provides an 
alternative for clinical therapy. Taking advantage of various action mechanisms, 
such drugs in combination with azole are likely to have synergistic effects, 
improving treatment efficacy and overcoming C. auris azole drug resistance. In 
this review, we outline the current state of understanding about the mechanisms 
of azole resistance mainly fluconazole, and the current advancement in 
therapeutic approaches such as drug combinations toward C. auris infections.","© 2023 Scandinavian Societies for Pathology, Medical Microbiology and

death (SCD). However, the time course of ventricular arrhythmias and potential 
mechanisms responsible for this effect after SAH remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effect of SAH on ventricular 
electrophysiological changes and its potential mechanisms in long-term phase.
METHODS: We examined the ventricular electrophysiological remodeling and 
potential mechanisms in a Sprague Dawley rat model of SAH at six time points 
(baseline, and Days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28) and explored the potential mechanisms. 
We measured the ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), ventricular 
fibrillation threshold (VFT), and left stellate ganglion (LSG) activity at 
different time points before and after SAH. We also detected neuropeptide Y 
(NPY) levels in plasma and myocardial tissues by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay, and quantified NPY 1 receptor (NPY1R) protein and mRNA expression levels 
by Western blotting and qRT-PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: SAH gradually prolonged QTc intervals, shortened ventricular ERP and 
reduced VFT during the acute phase, peaking at Day 3. However, no significant 
changes were observed from Days 14 to 28 compared to Day 0. SAH gradually 
increased LSG activity, increased NPY concentrations, and upregulated NPY1R 
expression in the acute phase of SAH, peaking at Day 3. However, no significant 
variations were found from Days 14 to 28 compared to Day 0.
CONCLUSION: SAH increases the transient susceptibility of VAs in the acute phase

mainly affect children and currently lack effective chemotherapeutic regimens. 
Liver MRTs are particularly challenging to manage due to the difficulty of 
performing one-stage liver resection, and preemptive liver transplantation is 
associated with high recurrence rates. However, the associating liver partition 
and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) technique offers a 
promising surgical approach for advanced-stage liver tumors where conventional 
liver resection is not feasible.
CASE REPORT: A patient with a large liver rhabdoid tumor that had invaded the 
three main hepatic veins underwent four courses of cisplatin-pirarubicin 
chemotherapy. ALPPS was performed due to insufficient residual liver capacity, 
with hepatic parenchymal dissection between the anterior and posterior liver 
zones in the first stage of surgery. After confirming adequate remaining liver 
volume, the liver was resected except for S1 and S6 on postoperative day 14. 
LDLT was performed 7 months after ALPPS due to the gradual deterioration of 
liver function caused by chemotherapy. The patient was recurrence-free 22 and 
15 months after ALPPS and LDLT, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ALPPS technique is a curative option for advanced-stage liver 
tumors that cannot be managed with conventional liver resection. In this case, 
ALPPS was used successfully to manage a large liver rhabdoid tumor. Then, liver 
transplantation was performed after chemotherapy. The ALPPS technique should be 
considered a potential treatment strategy for patients with advanced-stage liver 
tumors, particularly those who can undergo liver transplantation.",© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1111/petr.14559

the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Parthenolide (PTL), 
a well-known inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway, has emerged as an alternative 
treatment. However, whether PTL activity is tumor cell-specific and dependent on 
the mutational background has not been defined. This study investigated the 
antitumor role of PTL after tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation in 
various CRC cell lines with different mutational statuses of TP53. We observed 
that CRC cells displayed different patterns of basal p-IκBα levels; PTL reduced 
cell viability according to p-IκBα levels and p-IκBα levels varied among the 
cell lines according to the time of TNF-α stimulation. High concentrations of 
PTL reduced more effectively p-IκBα levels than low doses of PTL. However, PTL 
increased total IκBα levels in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. In addition, PTL 
treatment downregulated p-p65 levels in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells stimulated by 
TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PTL induced cell death via apoptosis 
and reduced the proliferation rate of TNF-α-treated HT-29 cells. Finally, PTL 
downregulated the messenger RNA levels of interleukin-1β, a downstream cytokine 
of NF-κB, reverted the E-cadherin-mediated disorganization of cell-cell 
contacts, and decreased the invasion of HT-29 cells. Together, these results 
suggest a differential antitumoral activity of PTL on CRC cells with different

and cell therapy has increased, leading to a rise in the amount of AAV vectors 
required during pre-clinical and clinical trials. AAV serotype 6 (AAV6) has been 
found to be efficient in transducing different cell types and has been 
successfully used in gene and cell therapy protocols. However, the number of 
vectors required to effectively deliver the transgene to one single cell has 
been estimated at 106 viral genomes (VG), making large-scale production of AAV6 
necessary. Suspension cell-based platforms are currently limited to low cell 
density productions due to the widely reported cell density effect (CDE), which 
results in diminished production at high cell densities and decreased 
cell-specific productivity. This limitation hinders the potential of the 
suspension cell-based production process to increase yields. In this study, we 
investigated the improvement of the production of AAV6 at higher cell densities 
by transiently transfecting HEK293SF cells. The results showed that when the 
plasmid DNA was provided on a cell basis, the production could be carried out at 
medium cell density (MCD, 4 × 106 cells/mL) resulting in titers above 1010 
VG/mL. No detrimental effects on cell-specific virus yield or cell-specific 
functional titer were observed at MCD production. Furthermore, while medium 
supplementation alleviated the CDE in terms of VG/cell at high cell density 
(HCD, 10 × 106 cells/mL) productions, the cell-specific functional titer was not 
maintained, and further studies are necessary to understand the observed 
limitations for AAV production in HCD processes. The MCD production method 
reported here lays the foundation for large-scale process operations, 
potentially solving the current vector shortage in AAV manufacturing. This

bacteria. Given their potential clinical applications for the diagnosis and 
treatment of cancer, it is essential to understand what becomes of them once 
they are within the body. With this aim, here we have followed the intracellular 
long-term fate of magnetosomes in two cell types: cancer cells (A549 cell line), 
because they are the actual target for the therapeutic activity of the 
magnetosomes, and macrophages (RAW 264.7 cell line), because of their role at 
capturing foreign agents. We show that cells dispose of magnetosomes using three 
mechanisms: splitting them into daughter cells, excreting them to the 
surrounding environment, and degrading them yielding less or non-magnetic iron 
products. A deeper insight into the degradation mechanisms by means of 
time-resolved X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy has 
allowed us to follow the intracellular biotransformation of magnetosomes by 
identifying and quantifying the iron species occurring during the process. In 
both cell types there is a first oxidation of magnetite to maghemite and then, 
earlier in macrophages than in cancer cells, ferrihydrite starts to appear. 
Given that ferrihydrite is the iron mineral phase stored in the cores of 
ferritin proteins, this suggests that cells use the iron released from the 
degradation of magnetosomes to load ferritin. Comparison of both cellular types 
evidences that macrophages are more efficient at disposing of magnetosomes than 
cancer cells, attributed to their role in degrading external debris and in iron 
homeostasis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1002/biot.202300173

(CER) using electronic health records (EHRs) may vary depending on the type and 
pattern of missing data. In this study, we aimed to quantify these impacts and 
compare the performance of different imputation methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an empirical (simulation) study to quantify 
the bias and power loss in estimating treatment effects in CER using EHR data. 
We considered various missing scenarios and used the propensity scores to 
control for confounding. We compared the performance of the multiple imputation 
and spline smoothing methods to handle missing data.
RESULTS: When missing data depended on the stochastic progression of disease and 
medical practice patterns, the spline smoothing method produced results that 
were close to those obtained when there were no missing data. Compared to 
multiple imputation, the spline smoothing generally performed similarly or 
better, with smaller estimation bias and less power loss. The multiple 
imputation can still reduce study bias and power loss in some restrictive 
scenarios, eg, when missing data did not depend on the stochastic process of 
disease progression.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Missing data in EHRs could lead to biased estimates 
of treatment effects and false negative findings in CER even after missing data 
were imputed. It is important to leverage the temporal information of disease 
trajectory to impute missing values when using EHRs as a data resource for CER 
and to consider the missing rate and the effect size when choosing an imputation 
method.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

Consequently, unauthorized factories make counterfeit instruments that are less 
expensive and may therefore be attractive to dentists. Little information exists 
about the metallurgy and manufacturing quality of such instruments. There is the 
potential for counterfeit instruments to be at higher risk of fracture during 
treatment, thereby compromising clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate physical and manufacturing properties of genuine and counterfeit 
ProTaper Next™ and Mtwo® rotary NiTi instruments.
METHODS: This study investigated the metallurgical properties, manufacturing 
quality, microhardness and number of cycles to failure of two commonly used 
rotary NiTi systems and compared them with counterfeit products purporting to be 
genuine articles.
RESULTS: Counterfeit instruments were found to be inferior in manufacturing 
standards and were less resistant to cyclic fatigue when compared to genuine 
instruments.
CONCLUSIONS: Counterfeit rotary NiTi instruments may be less efficient at 
preparing root canals and may be at higher risk of fracture during endodontic 
treatment. Dentists must be aware that, although less expensive, counterfeit 
instruments may be of dubious manufacturing quality and at higher risk of 
fracture if used in patients. © 2023 Australian Dental Association.","© 2023 The Authors. Australian Dental Journal published by John Wiley & Sons

particularly striking aspect of coral reef communities is the variety of colour 
patterns displayed by reef fishes. Colour pattern is known to play a central 
role in the ecology and evolution of reef fishes through, for example, 
signalling or camouflage. Nevertheless, colour pattern is a complex trait in 
reef fishes-actually a collection of traits-that is difficult to analyse in a 
quantitative and standardized way. This is the challenge that we address in this 
study using the hamlets (Hypoplectrus spp., Serranidae) as a model system. Our 
approach involves a custom underwater camera system to take orientation- and 
size-standardized photographs in situ, colour correction, alignment of the fish 
images with a combination of landmarks and Bézier curves, and principal 
component analysis on the colour value of each pixel of each aligned fish. This 
approach identifies the major colour pattern elements that contribute to 
phenotypic variation in the group. Furthermore, we complement the image analysis 
with whole-genome sequencing to run a multivariate genome-wide association study 
for colour pattern variation. This second layer of analysis reveals sharp 
association peaks along the hamlet genome for each colour pattern element and 
allows to characterize the phenotypic effect of the single nucleotide 
polymorphisms that are most strongly associated with colour pattern variation at 
each association peak. Our results suggest that the diversity of colour patterns 
displayed by the hamlets is generated by a modular genomic and phenotypic 
architecture.",© 2023 The Authors. Molecular Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/mec.17047

technologies to commercial applications. Herein, we report a facile and 
comprehensive strategy to fabricate high-performance silk materials by spinning 
silkworms artificially via a multi-task and high-efficiency centrifugal reeling 
technique. With this strategy, centrifugally reeled silks (CRSs) with 
long-uniform morphologies, excellent strength (844.83 ± 319.48 MPa), high 
toughness (121.07 ± 35.31 MJ m-3), and outstanding Young's modulus (27.72 ± 
12.61 GPa) are developed. Remarkably, the maximum strength (1.45 GPa) of CRS is 
3 times that of cocoon silk and even comparable to spider silk. Moreover, the 
centrifugal reeling technique realizes the one-step preparation of centrifugally 
reeled silk yarn (CRSY) from spinning silkworm, and the CRSYs show higher 
strength (877.38 ± 377.23 MPa) and superior torsional recovery performances. 
Furthermore, these CRSY-based soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) exhibit light 
weight, high-loading capability, easy programmability in strength and motions, 
and fast responses, and therefore outperform currently reported elastomer-based 
SPAs, showing promising applications in flexible sensors, artificial muscles,

Drosophila homoeotic gene spalt (sal) and acts as a zinc finger transcription 
factor to govern the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. 
SALL4 expression gradually decreases during development and is even absent in 
most adult tissues. However, increasing evidence suggests that SALL4 expression 
is restored in human cancers and its aberrant expression is associated with the 
progression of many hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors. The potent 
roles of SALL4 in regulating cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis,

modulation by acting as either an activator or a repressor of its target genes. 
Furthermore, SALL4 interacts with other partners to control the expression of 
many downstream genes and the activation of various key signaling transduction 
pathways. SALL4 is considered as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker 
and therapeutic target for cancer. In this review, we highlighted the major

reduced distal VH gene recombination over a 100-kb distance on either side of

desirable properties. Given the near limitless size of the protein sequence 
landscape, it is no surprise that these desirable sequences are often a relative 
rarity. This makes identifying such sequences a costly and time-consuming 
endeavor. In this work, we show how to use a deep transformer protein language 
model to identify sequences that have the most promise. Specifically, we use the 
model's self-attention map to calculate a Promise Score that weights the 
relative importance of a given sequence according to predicted interactions with 
a specified binding partner. This Promise Score can then be used to identify 
strong binders worthy of further study and experimentation. We use the Promise 
Score within two protein engineering contexts-Nanobody (Nb) discovery and 
protein optimization. With Nb discovery, we show how the Promise Score provides 
an effective way to select lead sequences from Nb repertoires. With protein 
optimization, we show how to use the Promise Score to select site-specific 
mutagenesis experiments that identify a high percentage of improved sequences. 
In both cases, we also show how the self-attention map used to calculate the 
Promise Score can indicate which regions of a protein are involved in 
intermolecular interactions that drive the targeted property. Finally, we 
describe how to fine-tune the transformer protein language model to learn a

expression, and effectively attenuated MI-induced collagen deposition and 
cardiac fibrosis. SAA attenuated myofibroblasts activation and cardiac fibrosis 
by inhibiting LDHA-driven abnormal aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistically, SAA 
inhibited Akt/GSK-3β axis and downregulated HIF-1α expression by promoting its 
degradation via a noncanonical route, and therefore restrained HIF-1α-triggered 
Ldha gene expression. SAA is an effective component for treating cardiac 
fibrosis by diminishing LDHA-driven glycolysis during myofibroblasts activation.

fluorescence quantum yield of 45% were rapidly and easily synthesized by thermal 
pyrolysis of 2,5-diaminotoluene sulfate and 
4-hydroxyethylpiperazineethanesulfonic acid using a one-step microwave-assisted 
hydrothermal approach. R-CQDs possessed the excitation-independent fluorescence 
property with the optimal emission peak at 607 nm under the excitation 
wavelength of 585 nm. R-CQDs exhibited excellent fluorescence stability under 
extremely harsh conditions in a pH range of 2-11, high ionic strength (1.8 M of 
NaCl), and long UV light irradiation time (160 min). The fluorescence quantum 
yield of these R-CQDs was as high as 45%, implying their preferable application 
in chemosensors and biological analysis. Because Fe3+ ion bound with R-CQDs and 
statically quenched the fluorescence of R-CQDs, the fluorescence intensity of 
R-CQDs was recovered after the addition of ascorbic acid (AA) via its redox 
reaction with Fe3+ ion. R-CQDs were developed as highly sensitive fluorescent 
on-off-on probes for sequentially sensing Fe3+ ions and AA. Under the optimal 
experimental conditions, the linear range for Fe3+ ion detection was 1-70 μM 
with a detection limit of 0.28 μM, and the linear range for AA detection was 
1-50 μM with a detection limit of 0.42 μM. The successful detection of Fe3+ ions 
in authentic water samples and the successful sensing of AA in human body fluids 
and vitamin C tablets further proved the practical application prospects of this 
efficient strategy in the environmental protection and disease diagnosis fields.","DOI: 10.1039/d3ay00501a

estimating patient prognosis. No studies have directly compared physician to 
model predictive performance in heart failure (HF). We aimed to compare the 
accuracy of physician versus model predictions of 1-year mortality.
METHODS: This multicenter prospective cohort study on 11 HF clinics in 5 
provinces in Canada included consecutive consented outpatients with HF with 
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%). By collecting clinical data, 
we calculated predicted 1-year mortality using the Seattle HF Model (SHFM), the 
Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic HF score, and the HF Meta-Score. HF 
cardiologists and family doctors, blinded to model predictions, estimated 
patient 1-year mortality. During 1-year follow-up, we recorded the composite end 
point of mortality, urgent ventricular assist device implant, or heart 
transplant. We compared physicians and model discrimination (C statistic), 
calibration (observed versus predicted event rate), and risk reclassification.
RESULTS: The study included 1643 patients with ambulatory HF with a mean age of 
65 years, 24% female, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 28%. Over 
1-year follow-up, 9% had an event. The SHFM had the best discrimination (SHFM C 
statistic 0.76; HF Meta-Score 0.73; Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart 
Failure 0.70) and calibration. Physicians' discrimination differed little (0.75 
for HF cardiologists and 0.73 for family doctors) but both physician groups 
substantially overestimated risk by >10% in both low- and high-risk patients 
(poor calibration). In risk reclassification analysis, among patients without 
events, the SHFM better classified 51% in comparison to HF cardiologists and 43% 
in comparison to family doctors. In patients with events, the SHFM erroneously 
assigned lower risk to 44% in comparison to HF cardiologists and 34% in 
comparison to family doctors.
CONCLUSIONS: Family doctors and HF cardiologists showed adequate risk 
discrimination, with however substantial overestimation of absolute risk. 
Predictive models showed higher accuracy. Incorporating models in family and HF 
cardiology practices may improve patient care and resource use in HF with 
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.

inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract associated with the 
dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Metabarcoding-based profiling of the gut microbiota 
of IBD patients is generally based on the stool samples collected from 
individual patients which rarely represent the mucosa-associated microbiota. The 
ideal sampling strategy for routine monitoring of the mucosal component of IBD 
has yet to be determined.
METHODS: We hereby compare the microbiota composition of the colonic cleansing 
fluid (CCF) collected during colonoscopy with stool samples from IBD patients. 
The relationship between IBD and gut microbiota was revealed through the 
application of the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing-based metabarcoding approach. 
CCF and stool samples were collected from IBD patients with Crohn's disease and 
ulcerative colitis.
RESULTS: The present study shows significant differences in the microbial 
composition of CCF samples, presumably indicating changes in the mucosal 
microbiota of IBD patients as compared to the control group. Short-chain fatty 
acid-producing bacteria under the family Lachnospiraceae, the actinobacterial 
genus Bifidobacterium, the proteobacterial Sutterella and Raoultella are found 
to contribute to the microbial dysbiosis of the mucosal flora in IBD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CCF microbiota has the capacity to distinguish IBD patients from 
healthy controls and, thus, may constitute an alternative analysis strategy for 
the early diagnosis and disease progression in IBD biomarker research.","DOI: 10.1080/00365521.2023.2223708

consist of gut microbiota and their biologically active metabolites, is 
associated with atherosclerosis development. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a 
metabolite produced by the GM through trimethylamine (TMA) oxidation, 
significantly enhances the formation and vulnerability of atherosclerotic 
plaques. TMAO promotes inflammation and oxidative stress in endothelial cells, 
leading to vascular dysfunction and plaque formation. Dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), 
iodomethylcholine (IMC) and fluoromethylcholine (FMC) have been recognized for 
their ability to reduce plasma TMAO by inhibiting trimethylamine lyase, a 
bacterial enzyme involved in the choline cleavage anaerobic process, thus 
reducing TMA formation. Conversely, indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and trigonelline 
inhibit TMA oxidation by inhibiting flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 (FMO3), 
resulting in reduced plasma TMAO. The combined use of inhibitors of choline 
trimethylamine lyase and flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 could provide novel 
therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention by stabilizing 
existing atherosclerotic plaques. This review aims to present the current 
evidence of the roles of TMA/TMAO in atherosclerosis as well as its potential 
therapeutic prevention aspects.","DOI: 10.17305/bb.2023.8893

by the accumulation of excessive fat in the liver, which can lead to fibrosis 
and has an increasing prevalence. NAFLD requires non-invasive diagnostic 
biomarkers. While typically observed in overweight individuals, it can also 
occur in non-obese/non-overweight individuals. Comparative studies on non-obese 
NAFLD patients are scarce. This study aimed to conduct a using liquid 
chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolic 
profiling of non-obese NAFLD patients and healthy controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient group consisted of 27 individuals with NAFLD, 
while the healthy control group included 39 individuals. Both groups were 
between 18 and 40 years old, had a BMI of less than 25 and had alcohol 
consumption less than 20 g/week for men and 10 g/week for women. Serum samples 
were collected and analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The data were analyzed using the 
TidyMass and MetaboAnalyst.
RESULTS: The LC-MS/MS analyses detected significant changes in D-amino acid 
metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, apoptosis, mTOR signaling pathway, lysine 
degradation, and phenylalanine metabolism pathways in non-obese NAFLD patients. 
Significant changes were also observed in the metabolites D-pantothenic acid, 
hypoxanthine, citric acid, citramalic acid, L-phenylalanine, glutamine, and 
histamine-trifluoromethyl-toluidide, β-hydroxymyristic acid, DL-Lactic acid, and 
3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the 
metabolic changes associated with non-obese NAFLD patients and can contribute to 
the development of non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for NAFLD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the metabolic changes in non-obese NAFLD 
patients. Further research is needed to better understand the metabolic changes 
associated with NAFLD and to develop effective treatment options.","DOI: 10.1080/00365521.2023.2225667

supercapacitor electrode materials owing to their good theoretical capacity and 
great electrical conductivity. The electrochemical features of the electrode 
materials based on monometallic or bimetallic phosphides are not desirable or 
satisfactory due to their low rate performance, unfavorable energy density, and 
short durability. One practical solution to overcome the above problems is to 
bring in heteroatoms to the structure of the bimetallic materials to create 
trimetallic phosphides. In this work, brand-new MnNiCoP yolk-shell spheres 
assembled with nanosheets are synthesized in a facile self-templated way using 
greatly uniform co-glycerate spheres as sacrificial templates, followed by a 
phosphorization process. Because of the existence of plenty of 
oxidation-reduction active sites, great surface area (SA) with mesoporous 
pathways, high electrical conductivity, and synergistic effect of Mn, Ni, and Co 
atoms, the fabricated MnNiCoP@NiF electrode demonstrates a considerably 
increased electrochemical efficiency compared with the bimetallic phosphide 
MnCoP@NiF electrode. Noticeably, the MnNiCoP@NiF electrode exhibits a great

reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and no haemodialysis. In this case 
report, we present two cases and review the current literature. The dose of 
irinotecan in both patients was reduced pre-emptively due to reduced GFR. The 
first patient had her irinotecan dose reduced to 50%, but was nevertheless 
admitted to hospital because of irinotecan-induced toxicity, including 
gastrointestinal toxicity and neutropenic fever. The dose was reduced further to 
40% for the second cycle, however the patient was again admitted to the 
hospital, and irinotecan was stopped indefinitely. The second patient also had 
his irinotecan dose reduced to 50% and was admitted to the emergency department 
for gastrointestinal toxicity after the first cycle. However, irinotecan could 
be administered in the same dose in later cycles. The AUCs0-inf of irinotecan 
and SN-38 in the first patient were comparable to those of an individual 
receiving 100% dose intensity. The AUCs0-inf of irinotecan and SN-38 in patient 
2 in both cycles were slightly less than aforementioned reference values. 
Furthermore, clearance values of irinotecan and SN-38 in our patients were 
comparable to those without renal impairment. In conclusion, our case report 
suggests that reduced GFR may not significantly affect the clearance of 
irinotecan and SN-38, but can still result in clinical toxicity. Reduced initial 
dosing seems indicated in this patient population. Further research is needed to 
fully understand the relationship between reduced GFR, pharmacokinetics, and

for colorectal cancer, hepatobiliary, hematologic, and skin cancers, but updated 
long-term data is needed. This study aimed to estimate the risk of cancer in 
patients with UC compared to the general Norwegian population, in a 
population-based cohort (the IBSEN study), 30 years after diagnosis; and to 
identify possible risk factors associated with cancer.
METHODS: The IBSEN cohort prospectively included all incident patients between 
1990 and 1993. Cancer incidence data were obtained from the Cancer Registry of 
Norway. The overall and cancer-specific hazard ratios (HR) were modelled using 
Cox regression. Standardized incidence ratios were estimated compared to the 
general population.
RESULTS: In total, the cohort included 519 patients, and 83 cases were diagnosed 
with cancer. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall 
cancer risk (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: [0.79-1.29]) and colorectal cancer risk (HR = 
1.37, 95% CI: [0.75-2.47]) between patients and controls. The incidence of 
biliary tract cancer was higher than expected (SIR = 9.84, 95%CI: [3.19-20.15]), 
especially when UC patients suffered from primary sclerosing cholangitis. Male 
UC patients were also more at risk of being diagnosed with hematologic 
malignancies (HR = 3.48, 95% CI: [1.55-7.82]). Being prescribed thiopurines was 
associated with a higher risk of cancer (HR = 2.03, 95% CI: [1.02-4.01]).
CONCLUSIONS: At 30 years after diagnosis, the risk of all cancer in patients 
with UC was not significantly increased compared with the general population. 
However, the risks of biliary tract cancer and hematologic cancers were 
increased, particularly in male patients.","DOI: 10.1080/00365521.2023.2223709

pregnancy (HDP) after multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR).
METHODS: A comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus 
was performed. Prospective or retrospective studies reporting on MFPR from 
triplet or higher-order to twin compared to ongoing (i.e., non-reduced) triplets 
and/or twins were included. A meta-analysis of the primary outcome HDP was 
carried out using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses of gestational 
hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE) were performed. Risk of bias was 
assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.
RESULTS: Thirty studies with a total of 9,811 women were included. MFPR from 
triplet to twin was associated with a lower risk for HDP compared to ongoing 
triplets (OR 0.55, 95% CI, 0.37-0.83; p = 0.004). In a subgroup analysis, the 
decreased risk of HDP was driven by GH, and PE was no longer significant (OR 
0.34, 95% CI, 0.17-0.70; p = 0.004 and OR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.38-1.09; p = 0.10, 
respectively). HDP was also significantly lower after MFPR from all higher-order 
(including triplets) to twin compared to ongoing triplets (OR 0.55, 95% CI, 
0.38-0.79; p = 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, the decreased risk of HDP was 
driven by PE, and GH was no longer significant (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.92; 
p = 0.02 and OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.28-1.06; p = 0.08, respectively). No significant 
differences in HDP were found in MFPR from triplet or higher-order to twin 
versus ongoing twins.
CONCLUSIONS: MFPR in women with triplet and higher-order multifetal pregnancies 
decreases the risk of HDP. Twelve women should undergo MFPR to prevent one event 
of HDP. These data can be used in the decision-making process of MFPR, in which 
the individual risk factors of HDP can be taken into account.","DOI: 10.1080/10641955.2023.2225597

reported, which possesses the advantages of a unique solvation structure and

superior low-temperature performance, delivering over 70% capacity at -70 °C and 
maintaining 72.5 mAh g-1 (≈77.1%) capacity for 200 cycles at a 1C rate at -40 
°C. Also, even when the rate increases to 5C, the battery could still operate 
well at -40 °C. This work demonstrates that solvation regulation has a

scrutinize the effects of non-covalent interactions on the out-of-plane 
displacement of iron and its spin-states and axial ligand orientation in a 
single distorted macrocyclic environment has been reported. Combined analysis 
using single-crystal X-ray structure determination and EPR spectral 
investigation revealed the stabilization of the high-spin state of iron in the 
five-coordinate complex FeIII(TPPBr8)(OCHMe2), while six-coordinate complexes 
[FeIII(TPPBr8)(MeOH)2]ClO4, [FeIII(TPPBr8)(H2O)2]ClO4 and 
[FeIII(TPPBr8)(1-MeIm)2]ClO4 stabilize admixed-high, admixed-intermediate and 
low-spin states, respectively. The H-bonding interactions between the weak axial 
H2O/MeOH and perchlorate anion resulted in an elongation of the Fe-O bond which 
eventually shortened the Fe-N(por) distances leading to the stabilization of the 
admixed spin state of iron which, otherwise, stabilizes the high-spin (S = 5/2) 
state only. In addition, the iron atom in [FeIII(TPPBr8)(H2O)2]ClO4 is displaced 
by 0.02 Å towards one of the water molecules engaged in the H-bonding 
interactions leading to two different Fe-O (H2O) distances of 2.098(8) and 
2.122(9) Å. In contrast, iron in [FeIII(TPPBr8)(MeOH)2]ClO4 sits on the plane of 
the porphyrin since both the axial methanol units are engaged in similar 
H-bonding interactions with the ClO4- ion. Moreover, the X-ray structure of 
low-spin FeII(TPPBr8)(1-MeIm)2 revealed a dihedral angle of 63.0° between two 
imidazoles which deviates largely from the expected angle of 90° (perpendicular 
orientations) since the axial imidazole protons are engaged in strong 
intermolecular C-H⋯π interactions which thereby restrict the axial ligand 
movement. The complex also displays the shortest Fe-N(1-MeIm) bond along with 
smallest dihedral angles of 7.8° and 22.4° between the axial imidazole ring and 
the closest Fe-Np axis due to strong π-interactions between iron and the axial 
imidazole ligand. Our work highlights the influence of non-covalent interactions 
on the out-of-plane displacement and spin state of iron and axial ligand 
orientations which are indeed important steps in the functioning of various

sensing applications owing to their excellent photo-stability, environmental 
stability, reasonable electronic conductivity, and ability to form 
nanostructures with diverse morphologies through self-assembly. However, no 
systematic analysis has been performed to rationalize molecular-level 
interactions between ammonia (NH3) and functionalized NDI probes, which is 
essential for systematic performance optimizations of NDI-based NH3 sensors. 
Therefore, this work proposes a phenylalanine-functionalized NDI derivative 
(NDI-PHE) as a model host for NH3 adsorption. Subsequent molecular interactions 
have been comprehensively studied following a complementary approach using ab 
initio calculation and experimental investigation. Specifically, NH3 adsorption 
at different atomic positions of NDI-PHE has been investigated using ab initio 
calculation, where the adsorption energy, charge transfer, and recovery time 
have been emphasized. The environmental stability of NDI-PHE and the underlying 
transduction mechanism during NH3 adsorption have been experimentally 
demonstrated to complement the theoretical analysis. The results exhibit that 
the presence of phenylalanine groups acts as an anchoring moiety and augments 
NH3 adsorption via hydrogen bonding and proton transfer interaction. 
Specifically, a highly stable room temperature adsorption of NH3 near a 
carboxylic phenylalanine group has been observed with a suitable recovery time 
at higher temperatures. NH3 adsorption results in electron transfer to the host 
molecule leading to the formation of stable radical anion species, which 
significantly modulated the frontal molecular orbitals of NDI-PHE, suggesting 
superior transduction for both electrochemical and optical detection.","DOI: 10.1039/d3cp01373a

lymphoma entity accounting for roughly 5% of all Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cases. In 
contrast to classical HL, the malignant cells in NLPHL are positive for CD20 but 
lack CD30. The disease usually has an indolent clinical course resulting in high 
long-term survival rates.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, treatment options for NLPHL are summarized and 
factors that may help to individualize treatment are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: Stage IA NLPHL without clinical risk factors should be treated 
with limited-field radiotherapy alone. In all other stages, NLPHL patients have 
excellent outcomes after standard HL approaches. The question of whether the 
addition of an anti-CD20 antibody to standard HL chemotherapy protocols or the 
use of approaches typically applied in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma improve 
treatment results is unanswered until now. Different management strategies 
ranging from low-intensity treatment to high-dose chemotherapy and autologous 
stem cell transplantation have demonstrated activity in relapsed NLPHL. 
Second-line treatment is thus chosen individually. The major aim of NLPHL 
research is to spare toxicity and reduce the risk for treatment-related adverse 
events in low-risk patients while treating higher-risk patients with appropriate 
intensity. To this end, novel tools to guide treatment are required.","DOI: 10.1080/17474086.2023.2226859

characterised by facial dysmorphism, genital and limb anomalies as well as 
disproportionate acromelic short stature. Clinical diagnosis is based on

as a defect in the bone remodeling process, affecting the function, 
differentiation, and maturation of osteoblasts. This process is located in the 
bone marrow, where the normal marrow tissue is replaced with immature bone 
islands and fibrous stroma. The etiology is unclear so far, but it is known to 
be connected with a point mutation of the gene that encodes Gs α protein at the 
time of embryogenesis, and because of that, all of the affected somatic cells 
become dysplastic. It is important to determine whether the mutation occurred 
earlier in the process of embryogenesis so that there will be more mutant cells 
and the disease will appear in a more severe form. The clinical presentation of 
FD is variable, so there are plenty of potential differential diagnoses. The 
most common include Paget disease, non-ossifying fibroma, osteofibrous 
dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cyst, adamantinoma, giant cell tumor, fracture 
callus, and low-grade central osteosarcoma.","Publisher: Fibröz displazi (FD), osteoblastların işlevini, farklılaşmasını ve

saline or CP and antioxidants for 7 weeks using gavage feeding. The results 
showed that oral administration of CP, CP combined with Vc and Ve (VCE) or 
Haematococcus pluvialis extract (HPE) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced a* of 
mouse skin and increased the content of Hyp and type I collagen to varying 
degrees, thereby improving skin integrity. Furthermore, the combination of CP, 
HPE, and VCE showed increased upregulation of antioxidant enzyme expression, 
reduced serum ROS, and decreased inhibition of metalloproteinase expression 
compared to the other treatment groups. Thus, this combination showed better 
effects in inhibiting collagen degradation and maintaining the redox balance. 
The Nrf2/ARE and TGF-β/Smad transcription systems are likely involved in these 
effects. Therefore, the results suggest that a diet containing CP, astaxanthin,

are used as green solvents. Their non-toxic nature, favorable biocompatibility 
and adjustable structure facilitate wide biomedical applications. ILs promote 
the generation of various nanohybrids that exhibit multiple functions and 
novel/improved properties with respect to their precursors. Generally, 
nanostructures have a large specific surface area and abundant functional groups 
which enable loading and incorporation of ILs through physical interactions or 
chemical bonding. According to their main skeleton structures, IL-based 
nanohybrids may be divided into five categories, i.e., poly(ionic liquid)s 
(PILs), IL-inorganic nanohybrids, IL-metal organic framework nanohybrids (IL-MOF 
nanohybrids), ILs/carbon materials and ionic materials. These IL-based 
nanohybrids exhibit various specific features, including thermal responsive 
behavior, metal chelating, photothermal conversion and antibacterial 
capabilities. Taking advantage of these characteristics, IL-based nanohybrids 
may overcome the shortcomings of conventional medicines/drugs and exhibit 
promising prospects in biomedicine to facilitate controlled drug release, 
bactericidal treatment and thermotherapy. The present review presents the 
state-of-the-art progress made in the studies of IL-based nanohybrids in terms 
of their classifications, structure characteristics, versatile functionalities

such as pro-inflammatory (M1) or pro-wound healing (M2). To reduce M1 
activation, the JAK/STAT pathway can be targeted by using suppressors of 
cytokine signaling (SOCS1) proteins. Recently a peptide mimicking the kinase 
inhibitory region (KIR) of SOCS1 has been utilized to manipulate the adaptive 
immune response. However, the utilization of SOCS1-KIR to reduce 
pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages is yet to be investigated in a 
biomaterial formulation. This study introduces a PEGDA hydrogel platform to 
investigate SOCS1-KIR as a macrophage phenotype manipulating peptide. 
Immunocytochemistry, cytokine secretion assays, and gene expression analysis for 
pro-inflammatory macrophage markers in 2D & 3D experiments demonstrate a 
reduction in M1 activation due to SOCS1-KIR treatment. We demonstrate the 
retention of SOCS1-KIR in the hydrogel through release assays and diffusion 
tests. The swelling ratio of the hydrogel also remains unaffected with the 
entrapment of SOCS1-KIR. This study elucidates how SOCS1-KIR peptide in PEGDA 
hydrogels can be utilized as an effective therapeutic for macrophage

contributing to the global burden of disease and mortality, despite the COVID-19 
pandemic. May Measurement Month (MMM), an annual global screening campaign aims 
to highlight the importance of BP measurement by evaluating global awareness, 
treatment and control rates among adults with hypertension. In 2021, we assessed 
the global burden of these rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Screening sites were set up in 54 countries between May and November 
2021 and screenees were recruited by convenience sampling. Three sitting BPs 
were measured, and a questionnaire completed including demographic, lifestyle 
and clinical data. Hypertension was defined as a systolic BP at least 140 mmHg 
and/or a diastolic BP at least 90 mmHg (using the mean of the second and third 
readings) or taking antihypertensive medication. Multiple imputation was used to 
impute the average BP when readings were missing.
RESULTS: Of the 642 057 screenees, 225 882 (35.2%) were classified as 
hypertensive, of whom 56.8% were aware, and 50.3% were on antihypertensive 
medication. Of those on treatment, 53.9% had controlled BP (<140/90 mmHg). 
Awareness, treatment and control rates were lower than those reported in MMM 
campaigns before the COVID-19 pandemic. Minimal changes were apparent among 
those testing positive for, or being vaccinated against COVID-19. Of those on 
antihypertensive medication, 94.7% reported no change in their treatment because 
of the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: The high yield of untreated or inadequately treated hypertension in 
MMM 2021 confirms the need for systematic BP screening where it does not 
currently exist.","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","DOI: 10.1097/HJH.0000000000003488

presents with pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. There are many available 
treatments for migraine, but some patients still need an option that works well 
for them, that is noninvasive, or does not need to be taken orally. Here we 
provide a drug evaluation of INP104, an approved acute treatment for migraine 
that combines a drug and a device: the medication dihydroergotamine (DHE) 
mesylate, which has been used for decades for treating acute symptoms of 
migraine, and the Precision Olfactory Delivery (POD®) device, which delivers 
DHE mesylate to the hard-to-reach upper regions of the nose. Targeting this 
region helps medication to be absorbed faster and more consistently. In clinical 
trials, INP104 demonstrated favorable drug properties, came with few adverse 
events, and provided fast relief from migraine symptoms.","DOI: 10.2217/pmt-2022-0063

alterations in blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness already early in life, 
and how this is associated with gestational, perinatal and child cardiovascular 
risk profiles.
METHODS: One hundred eighty-two PE (46 early-onset with diagnosis before 34 
gestational weeks, and 136 late-onset) and 85 non-PE children were assessed 
8-12 years from delivery. Office and 24-h ambulatory BP, body composition, 
anthropometrics, lipids, glucose, inflammatory markers, and tonometry-derived 
pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central BPs were assessed.
RESULTS: Office BP, central BPs, 24-h systolic BP (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) 
were higher in PE compared with non-PE. Early-onset PE children had the highest 
SBP, SBP-loads, and PP. SBP nondipping during night-time was common among PE. 
The higher child 24-h mean SBP among PE was explained by maternal SBP at first 
antenatal visit and prematurity (birth weight or gestational weeks), but child 
24-h mean PP remained related with PE and child adiposity after adjustments. 
Central and peripheral PWVs were elevated in late-onset PE subgroup only and 
attributed to child age and anthropometrics, child and maternal office SBP at 
follow-up, but relations with maternal antenatal SBPs and prematurity were not 
found. There were no differences in body anthropometrics, composition, or blood 
parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: PE children develop an adverse BP profile and arterial stiffness 
early in life. PE-related BP is related with maternal gestational BP and 
prematurity, whereas arterial stiffness is determined by child characteristics 
at follow-up. The alterations in BP are pronounced in early-onset PE.Clinical

cell transplantation (AHSCT) is one of the possible disease-modifying therapies 
(DMTs) for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In this case series, we would 
like to present six patients with MS, who underwent AHSCT as the first-line DMT.
CASE REPORTS: Six MS patients with a rapid progression of disability with or 
without relapses underwent AHSCT as the first-line DMT at the University 
Hospital Ostrava between 2018 and 2021. The conditioning regimens for AHSCT used 
were a medium-intensity regime BEAM (Carmustine, Etoposid, Cytarabin, Melphalan) 
and low-intensity regime based on Cyclophosphamide. Four out of six patients 
showed some disability progression after AHSCT, so the rapid progression of MS 
was just slowed down by AHSCT. One patient developed activity on magnetic 
resonance imaging three months after AHSCT, and two experienced mild relapses 
during the follow-up period. None of our patients developed grade 4 
non-hematological toxicity; all infections were mild. In one patient, an 
allergic reaction probably to dimethyl sulfoxide was observed.
CONCLUSION: Our case series of 6 patients shows that AHSCT is a promising 
therapeutic approach to slow down the rapid progression of clinical disability 
in MS patients with a good safety profile.","DOI: 10.5507/bp.2023.023

which effective treatments are lacking. Scutellarin is a flavonoid with 
anti-apoptotic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the 
possible protective effects of scutellarin on UC induced by acetic acid in rats. 
We used five groups of male rats: control, scutellarin, UC, UC + scutellarin, UC 
+ sulfasalazine. Colonic mucosal inflammation was evaluated microscopically. 
Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total antioxidant 
status (TAS), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α) and DNA fragmentation levels were measured. Colon tissue sections were 
evaluated using immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2 and Bax, TUNEL staining and 
histopathology. Pretreatment with scutellarin significantly reduced histological 
damage. Scutellarin significantly reduced serum and tissue levels of MDA, NO, 
IL-6 and TNF-α, and increased enzymatic activity of SOD and TAS. Scutellarin 
suppressed apoptosis by down-regulation of Bax, reduction of DNA fragmentation 
and increased expression of Bcl-2. Apoptosis was increased, while antioxidant 
enzymes were significantly decreased; some histopathologic disorders also were 
seen in the UC group. Administration of scutellarin ameliorated the pathological 
and biochemical alterations caused by UC in rats. We found that scutellarin 
might be protective against UC by down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
suppressing apoptosis and oxidative stress.","DOI: 10.1080/10520295.2023.2224061

route to mitigate energy crisis and close carbon footprint. However, the 
difficulty on breaking N≡N is the main reason that caused low efficiencies for 
both electrocatalytic NH3 and urea synthesis, which is the bottleneck 
restricting their industrial applications. Herein, a new mechanism to overcome 
the inert of the nitrogen molecule was proposed by elongating N≡N instead of 
breaking N≡N to realize one-step C-N coupling in the process for urea 
production. We constructed a Zn-Mn diatomic catalyst with axial chloride 
coordination, Zn-Mn sites display high tolerance to CO poisoning and the 
Faradaic efficiency can even be increased to 63.5%, which is the highest value 
that has ever been reported. More importantly, negligible N≡N bond breakage 
effectively avoids the generation of ammonia as intermediates, therefore, the 
N-selectivity in the co-electrocatalytic system reaches100% for urea synthesis. 
The previous cognition that electrocatalysts for urea synthesis must possess 
ammonia synthesis activity has been broken. Isotope-labelled measurements and 
Operando synchrotron-radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validate 
that activation of N-N triple bond and nitrogen fixation activity arise from the

deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramide (GalCer) β-galactosidase 
(GALC). The Twitcher (Twi) mouse is a naturally occurring, genetically and 
enzymatically authentic mouse model that mimics infantile-onset Krabbe disease. 
The major substrate for GALC is the myelin lipid GalCer. However, the 
pathogenesis of Krabbe disease has long been explained by the accumulation of 
psychosine, a lyso-derivative of GalCer. Two metabolic pathways have been 
proposed for the accumulation of psychosine: a synthetic pathway in which 
galactose is transferred to sphingosine and a degradation pathway in which 
GalCer is deacylated by acid ceramidase (ACDase). Saposin-D (Sap-D) is essential 
for the degradation of ceramide by ACDase in lysosome. In this study, we 
generated Twi mice with a Sap-D deficiency (Twi/Sap-D KO), which are genetically 
deficient in both GALC and Sap-D and found that very little psychosine 
accumulated in the CNS or PNS of the mouse. As expected, demyelination with the 
infiltration of multinucleated macrophages (globoid cells) characteristic of 
Krabbe disease was milder in Twi/Sap-D KO mice than in Twi mice both in the CNS 
and PNS during the early disease stage. However, at the later disease stage, 
qualitatively and quantitatively comparable demyelination occurred in Twi/Sap-D 
KO mice, particularly in the PNS, and the lifespans of Twi/Sap-D KO mice were 
even shorter than that of Twi mice. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from both 
Twi and Twi/Sap-D KO mice produced significant amounts of TNF-α upon exposure to 
GalCer and were transformed into globoid cells. These results indicate that 
psychosine in Krabbe disease is mainly produced via the deacylation of GalCer by 
ACDase. The demyelination observed in Twi/Sap-D KO mice may be mediated by a 
psychosine-independent, Sap-D-dependent mechanism. GalCer-induced activation of 
Sap-D-deficient macrophages/microglia may play an important role in the 
neuroinflammation and demyelination in Twi/Sap-D KO mice.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Neurochemistry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

molecular mechanism through which GmBIR1 regulates plant immunity. 
Overexpression of wild-type variant of GmBIR1 (WT-GmBIR1) using transgenic 
soybean hairy roots significantly increased soybean susceptibility to SCN, 
whereas overexpression of kinase-dead variant (KD-GmBIR1) significantly 
increased plant resistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes 
oppositely regulated in WT-GmBIR1 and KD-GmBIR1 upon SCN infection were enriched 
primarily in defense and immunity-related functions. Quantitative 
phosphoproteomic analysis identified 208 proteins as putative substrates of the 
GmBIR1 signaling pathway, 114 of which were differentially phosphorylated upon 
SCN infection. In addition, the phosphoproteomic data pointed to a role of the 
GmBIR1 signaling pathway in regulating alternative pre-mRNA splicing. 
Genome-wide analysis of splicing events provided compelling evidence supporting 
a role of the GmBIR1 signaling pathway in establishing alternative splicing

of the aortic middle layer, the abnormal number or function of which has been 
demonstrated to have a role in thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). Here, this study 
aimed to identify the function of circ_0008285 in VSMC apoptosis.
METHODS: Human VSMCs were treated with angiotensin II (Ang II) for functional 
experiments. Cell counting kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and flow 
cytometry were applied for function analysis. The interaction between miR-150-5p 
and circ_0008285 or brain acid-soluble protein 1 (BASP1) was also evaluated by 
dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Exosomes were 
isolated by the commercial kit.
RESULTS: A highly expressed circ_0008285 was observed in the aortic tissues of 
TAA patients and Ang-II-induced VSMCs. Circ_0008285 deficiency dramatically 
reversed Ang-II-induced proliferation arrest and apoptosis promotion in VSMCs. 
Circ_0008285 functionally targeted miR-150-5p. MiR-150-5p inhibition attenuated 
the inhibitory effects of circ_0008285 silencing on Ang-II-evoked apoptosis in 
VSMCs. BASP1 was verified to be a target of miR-150-5p, and was proved to 
attenuate miR-150-5p-triggered apoptosis arrest in Ang-II-stimulated VSMCs. 
Additionally, extracellular circ_0008285 was packaged into exosomes, which could 
be transferred into the recipient cells.
CONCLUSION: Circ_0008285 silencing could suppress Ang-II-induced VSMCs apoptosis 
via miR-150-5p/BASP1 axis, adding further understanding of the pathogenesis of 
TAA.","© 2023 The Authors. Thoracic Cancer published by China Lung Oncology Group and

east and southern Africa (ESA) remains the world regions most affected. Given 
increasing calls for the implementation of HIV-sensitive social protection 
programmes to address the multiple individual, community and societal factors 
that heighten the risk of HIV infection, this article explores the extent to 
which social protection mechanisms in the region are HIV sensitive. The article 
is based on a two-phase project where the first phase entailed a desktop review 
of national social protection policies and programmes. In the second phase, 
multisectoral stakeholder consultations conducted were 15 fast-track countries 
in the region. The key findings suggest that social protection policies and 
social assistance programmes in ESA do not specifically target HIV issues or 
people living with, at risk of, or affected by HIV. Rather, and in line with the 
countries' constitutional provisions, the programmes tend to be inclusive of the 
vulnerabilities of various populations including people living with HIV. To this 
end, the programmes can be seen as generally sufficient to encompass HIV-related 
issues and the needs of people infected and affected by the epidemic. However, a 
recurring argument from many stakeholders is that, to the extent that people 
living with HIV are often reluctant to either disclose their status and/or 
access social protection services, it is critical for social protection policies 
and programmes to be explicitly HIV sensitive. The article thus concludes by 
making recommendations in this regard as well as by making a class for 
multisectoral partners to work collaboratively to ensure that social protection 
policies and programmes are transformative.","DOI: 10.2989/16085906.2023.2203131

with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether the ECS alteration is present in 
the early stage of MS remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: First, to compare the ECS profile between newly diagnosed MS 
patients and healthy controls (HCs). Next, to explore the association of ECS, 
biomarkers of inflammation and clinical parameters in newly diagnosed MS 
patients.
METHODS: Whole blood gene expression of ECS components and levels of 
endocannabinoids in plasma were measured by real-time qPCR and 
ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively, in 66 
untreated MS patients and 46 HCs.
RESULTS: No differences were found in the gene expression or plasma levels of 
the selected ECS components between newly diagnosed MS patients and HCs. 
Interferon gamma, encoded by the gene IFNG, correlated positively (rho = 0.60) 
with the expression of GPR55 (G Protein-Coupled Receptor 55), and IL1B

CONCLUSIONS: We found no alteration in the peripheral ECS between untreated 
patients with MS and HC. Furthermore, our results indicates that the ECS has a

investigate testicular production of testosterone (T) when performing a breeding 
soundness examination. In male dogs with fertility problems the prostate should 
also be investigated as prostatic conditions may frequently lower semen quality. 
Serum concentrations of canine prostatic specific esterase (CPSE) increase in 
dogs with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). When performing a breeding 
soundness examination in a male dog GnRH administration is frequently done at 
the beginning of the process and then both T and CPSE are assayed on the same 
serum sample collected one hour following the GnRH injection. The aim of this 
study was to assess whether or not the administration of GnRH may alter CPSE 
concentrations in dogs with a healthy prostate. Twenty-eight client-owned intact 
adult male dogs were included in the study. Following a 7-day sexual rest all 
male dogs underwent a clinical examination and an ultrasonographic exam of the 
prostatic gland. Prostatic size and parenchyma of every tested dog was evaluated 
by ultrasonography to assess prostatic conditions. Two different GnRH 
stimulation protocols were used, A = gonadorelin 50 μg/dog SC (n=15) and B = 
buserelin 0.12 μg/kg IV (n=13). T and CPSE concentrations were measured before 
and one hour after GnRH administration by a laser-induced fluorescence analysis. 
Buserelin and gonadorelin were equally effective in causing a significant 
increase in serum T concentrations in the post GnRH sample. When considering the 
28 dogs together CPSE concentrations did not change following the stimulation 
test with either GnRH compound; however, in 4/28 cases the post GnRH value was 
markedly increased to values compatible with a diagnosis of BPH. There was no 
difference in the action of buserelin or gonadorelin in causing an increase in 
serum T concentrations. CPSE secretion was increased in approximately 15% of 
dogs treated with either buserelin or gonadorelin. Therefore, whenever

is crucial for the development of solar harvesting technologies, including 
photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and solar fuel systems. However, modern 
artificial photosynthetic materials are not efficient and limited by their fast 
charge recombination with high binding energy of excitons. Hence, reducing the 
exciton binding energy can increase the generation of charge carriers, which 
improve the photocatalytic activities. Extensive research has been dedicated to 
improving the exciton dissociation efficiency through rational semiconductor 
design via heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering, the construction of 
heterostructures, and donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) interfaces to extend the charge 
carrier migration, promoting the dissociation of excitons. Consequently, 
functionalized photocatalysts have demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic 
performances for solar fuel production under visible light irradiation. This 
review provides the fundamental aspects of excitons in semiconductor 
nanostructures, having a high binding energy and ultrafast exciton formation 
together with promising photo-redox properties for solar to fuel conversion 
application. In particular, this review highlights the significant role of the 
excitonic effect in the photocatalytic activity of newly developed functional 
materials and the underlying mechanistic insight for tuning the performance of 
nanostructured semiconductor photocatalysts for water splitting, CO2 reduction,

analytes (e.g., ions, molecules, and microorganisms) provide valuable 
information for medical diagnosis, personal health care, and environmental 
monitoring. However, the conductive electrodes of such sensors need to be 
exposed to the surrounding environments like chloride-containing aqueous 
solutions during their operation, where chloride ions (Cl-) can potentially 
cause corrosion and dissolution of the sensors, negatively impacting their 
performance and durability. In this work, we develop soft, flexible conductivity 
sensors made of gold (Au) electrodes and systematically study their 
electrochemical behaviors in sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions to prevent 
chloride-induced corrosion and enhance their sensitivity for marine 
environmental monitoring. The causes of gold chlorination reactions and 
polarization effects are identified and effectively prevented by analyzing the 
effects of direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) voltages, AC 
frequencies, and exposed sensing areas of the conductivity (salinity) sensors. 
Accordingly, a performance diagram is constructed to provide guidance for the 
selection of operation parameters for the salinity sensor. We also convert the 
varying impedance values of salinity sensors at different salinity levels into 
output voltage signals using a voltage divider circuit with an AC voltage (0.6 
V) source. The results offer an assessment of the accuracy and response time of 
the salinity sensors, as well as their potential for integration with data 
transmission components for real-time ocean monitoring. This study has important 
implications for the development of soft, flexible, Au-based electrochemical 
sensors that can operate efficiently in diverse biological fluids and marine 
environments.","DOI: 10.1039/d3tb01167d

phenotypes by reducing neuroinflammatory responses. In the present study, we 
investigated whether 6-shogaol and ginger attenuate degeneration induced by 
Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) on the intestine and brain, simultaneously. 
C57BL/6J mice received P. mirabilis for 5 days. Ginger (300 mg/kg) and 6-shogaol 
(10 mg/kg) were treated by gavage feeding for 22 days including the period of P. 
mirabilis treatment. Results showed that 6-shogaol and ginger improved motor 
dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal death induced by P. mirabilis treatment. 
In addition, they suppressed P. mirabilis-induced intestinal barrier disruption, 
pro-inflammatory signals such as toll-like receptor and TNF-α, and intestinal 
α-synuclein aggregation. Moreover, ginger and 6-shogaol significantly inhibited 
neuroinflammation and α-synuclein in the brain. Taken together, 6-shogaol and 
ginger have the potential to ameliorate PD-like motor behavior and degeneration 
of dopaminergic neurons induced by P. mirabilis in mice. Here, these findings 
are meaningful in that they provide the first experimental evidence that

overlooked. Positive childhood experiences (PCEs) measures quantify protective 
factors, but evidence is lacking on their link to health conditions independent 
of ACEs in nationally representative studies. This study examines associations 
between composite PCE score and adult health, adjusting for ACEs.
METHODS: The most recent 2017 wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a 
nationally representative study and its 2014 Childhood Retrospective 
Circumstances supplement (n = 7496) collected adult health outcomes, PCEs, and 
ACEs. Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations between PCE score 
and adult self-rated health or condition diagnosis, with and without ACEs 
adjustment. Cox proportional hazards models examined relationships between PCEs, 
ACEs, and annual risk of diagnosis.
RESULTS: Adults with 5 to 6 PCEs had 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.58-0.93) of the risk of fair/poor overall health and 74% of the risk of any 
psychiatric diagnosis (CI, 0.59-0.89) compared with those with 0 to 2 PCEs,

a worldwide proportion of approximately 90% of people preferring to use the 
right hand for many tasks. In the Korean population, the proportion of 
left-handedness is relatively low at approximately 7%-10%, similar to that in 
other East-Asian cultures in which the use of the left hand for writing and 
other public activities has historically been oppressed.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
between right-handedness and left-handedness, and between right-handedness and 
ambidexterity using logistic regression analyses using a Korean community-based 
cohort. We also performed association analyses with previously reported variants 
and our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 8806 participants were included for analysis, and the 
results identified 28 left-handedness-associated and 15 ambidexterity-associated 
loci; of these, two left-handedness loci (NEIL3 [rs11726465] and SVOPL 
[rs117495448]) and one ambidexterity locus (PDE8B/WDR41 [rs118077080]) showed 
near genome-wide significance. Association analyses with previously reported 
variants replicated ANKS1B (rs7132513) in left-handedness and ANKIB1 (rs2040498) 
in ambidexterity.
CONCLUSION: The variants and positional candidate genes identified and 
replicated in this study were largely associated with brain development, 
cerebral asymmetry, neurological processes, and neuropsychiatric diseases in 
line with previous findings. As the first East-Asian GWAS related to handedness, 
these results may provide an intriguing reference for further human neurologic

proteins in eukaryotes; however, the regulatory mechanism in seed longevity 
remains unknown. Here, we report that an uncharacterized E3 ligase, ARABIDOPSIS 
TÓXICOS EN LEVADURA 5 (ATL5), positively regulates seed longevity by mediating 
the degradation of ACTIVATOR OF BASAL TRANSCRIPTION 1 (ABT1) in Arabidopsis. 
Seeds in which ATL5 was disrupted showed faster accelerated aging than the 
wild-type, while expressing ATL5 in atl5-2 basically restored the defective 
phenotype. ATL5 was highly expressed in the embryos of seeds, and its expression 
could be induced by accelerated aging. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified ABT1 
as an ATL5 interacting protein, which was further confirmed by bimolecular 
fluorescence complementary assay and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. In vitro 
and in vivo assays showed that ATL5 functions as an E3 ligase and mediates the 
polyubiquitination and degradation of ABT1. Disruption of ATL5 diminished the

of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.","Background: Optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for the 
effective management of HIV. Mental disorders often co-occur with HIV infection 
which often compromises ART adherence. Little is known about ART adherence in 
psychiatric settings in sub-Saharan Africa.Aims: This study aimed at exploring 
the health care providers' perspectives on ART adherence among psychiatric 
inpatients. The study further assessed the facilitators and strategies enhancing 
ART adherence in hospitalised psychiatric patients.Methods: In-depth interviews 
were conducted with 25 health care providers at the Sbrana Psychiatric Hospital 
in Botswana. Interviews were focused on barriers and facilitators to psychiatric 
inpatients' adherence to ART, and strategies and recommendations to support 
adherence. Data were manually analysed using a thematic analysis 
approach.Results: Key barriers were lack of insight, HIV-related stigma, lack of 
HIV-related knowledge, antiretroviral side effects and delays in re-initiating 
ART. Facilitators of ART adherence included motivation to be discharged from the 
hospital, fear of being sick, peer support, longer duration of hospitalisation, 
good provider-patient relationships, good diet, privacy and confidentiality and 
a single-tablet regimen. Health care providers described the various strategies 
currently used to support adherence, including directly observed therapy and 
family support, and recommended potential approaches to enhance psychiatric 
inpatient adherence to ART, including the use of injectable antiretrovirals and 
the introduction of halfway house centres.Conclusions: Findings from this study 
revealed unique insights into the numerous factors that influence ART adherence 
among psychiatric inpatients, and underscore the need to implement tailored 
strategies to support ART adherence in this population with complex health 
needs.","DOI: 10.2989/16085906.2023.2213211

95-95-95 targets and epidemic control. We examined these challenges among 103 
HIV-positive AGYW in and out of HIV care in communities around Lake Victoria in

social-ecological model to guide development of interview guides. 
Individual-level barriers included denial and forgetfulness and gendered 
household responsibilities, medication side effects, especially if taken without 
food, pills being too big and difficult to swallow and the burden of a daily 
medication-taking regimen. Interpersonal barriers included troubled family 
relationships and pervasive fears of stigma and discrimination by friends and 
family. Communitylevel barriers were stigmatising attitudes toward people living 
with HIV. Health-system barriers included negative provider attitudes and 
confidentiality breaches. At the structural level, participants noted high costs 
due to long travel times to facilities, long clinic waiting times, household 
food insecurity and school and work commitments. AGYW's limited decision-making 
autonomy due to age and gender norms, including their reliance on the authority 
of older adults, makes these barriers especially troubling. Innovative treatment 
approaches that take into account the unique vulnerabilities of AGYW are

consequence of traumatic brain injuries (TBI), with devastating social and 
economic impacts. Unfortunately, few treatment options are currently available 
due to a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. A 
clinically-relevant, in vitro experimental model that emulates in vivo scenarios 
with high levels of spatial and temporal resolution is critical for demystifying 
the pathways of post-TBI AD. Using a unique, recently established 
""TBI-on-a-chip"" system with murine cortical networks, we demonstrate the 
correlative elevation of oxidative stress (acrolein), inflammation (TNF-α), and 
Aβ42 aggregation, with concomitant reduction of neuronal network electrical 
activity post-concussive impact. These findings confirm that TBI-on-a-chip could 
provide a novel paradigm to supplement in vivo studies of trauma, while 
simultaneously validating the interaction of these alleged, key-pathological 
factors in post-TBI AD development. Specifically, we have shown that acrolein, 
acting as a diffusive factor of secondary injury, is both critical and 
sufficient in promoting inflammation (TNF-α) and Aβ42 aggregation, two known 
contributors of AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, using a cell-free preparation with 
TBI-on-a-chip, we have confirmed that both force and acrolein can independently 
and directly stimulate the aggregation of purified Aβ42, highlighting the key 
capabilities of primary and secondary injury mechanisms towards inducing Aβ42 
aggregation, independently and synergistically. In addition to morphological and 
biochemical assessment, we also demonstrate parallel monitoring of neuronal 
network activity, further validating the chief pathological role of acrolein in 
not only inflicting biochemical abnormalities, but also functional deficits in 
neuronal networks. In conclusion, through this line of investigations, we have 
shown that by recapitulating clinically-relevant events, the TBI-on-a-chip 
device is capable of quantitatively characterizing parallel force-dependent 
increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, protein aggregation, and network 
activity, offering a unique platform for mechanistic investigations of post-TBI 
AD, and trauma-induced neuronal injury in general. It is expected that this 
model could provide crucial insights into pathological mechanisms which will be 
critical in developing novel, effective diagnostics and treatment strategies 
that significantly benefit TBI victims.","DOI: 10.1039/d3lc00248a

vulnerable children due to HIV/AIDS has spurred demand for psychosocial support 
services. When the Ministry of Education and Training assumed responsibility for 
delivering psychosocial support, educators were burdened with the additional 
role of looking after orphans and vulnerable learners. This exploratory, 
sequential, mixed-methods study was employed to analyse factors that enhance the 
provision of psychosocial support services and the perceptions of educators 
towards psychosocial support delivery. The qualitative study phase entailed 16 
in-depth interviews with multi-sectoral psychosocial support specialists and 
seven focus group discussions with orphans and vulnerable learners. In the 
quantitative study phase, 296 educators were surveyed. Thematic analysis was 
used for the qualitative data, and the quantitative data was analysed using 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 software. The findings 
reveal problems associated with psychosocial support service delivery at 
strategy, policy and operational levels. The results indicate that orphans and 
vulnerable children are offered material support (e.g. food and sanitary pads) 
and spiritual support, but were rarely referred for social and psychological 
needs. There were no proper counselling facilities and not all teachers received 
relevant training in children's psychosocial needs. Training of educators in 
specific psychosocial support areas was considered significant to enhance 
service delivery and the psychosocial well-being of the learners. Overall, 
accountability was difficult to establish because the administration of 
psychosocial support is split among the Ministry of Education and Training, the 
Deputy Prime Minister's office and Tinkhundla administration. There is unequal 
distribution of qualified early childhood development teachers to cater for 
early childhood educational needs.","DOI: 10.2989/16085906.2023.2203128

highly malignant, invasive, and lethal characteristics. After treatment with the 
conventional therapeutic paradigm of surgery combined with radio- and 
chemotherapy, patients bearing GBMs generally exhibit a poor prognosis, with 
high mortality and a high disability rate. The main reason is the existence of 
the formidable blood-brain barrier (BBB), aggressive growth, and the 
infiltration nature of GBMs. Especially, the BBB suppresses the delivery of 
imaging and therapeutic agents to lesion sites, and thus this leads to 
difficulties in achieving a timely diagnosis and treatment. Recent studies have 
demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) exhibit favorable merits 
including good biocompatibility, a strong drug loading capacity, long 
circulation time, good BBB crossing efficiency, specific targeting to lesion 
sites, and high efficiency in the delivery of a variety of cargos for GBM 
therapy. Importantly, EVs inherit physiological and pathological molecules from 
the source cells, which are ideal biomarkers for molecularly tracking the 
malignant progression of GBMs. Herein, we start by introducing the 
pathophysiology and physiology of GBMs, followed by presenting the biological 
functions of EVs in GBMs with a special focus on their role as biomarkers for 
GBM diagnosis and as messengers in the modulation of the GBM microenvironment. 
Furthermore, we provide an update on the recent progress of using EVs in 
biology, functionality, and isolation applications. More importantly, we 
systematically summarize the most recent advances of EV-based carriers for GBM 
therapy by delivering different drugs including gene/RNA-based drugs, 
chemotherapy drugs, imaging agents, and combinatory drugs. Lastly, we point out 
the challenges and prospects of future research on EVs for diagnosing and 
treating GBMs. We hope this review will stimulate interest from researchers with 
different backgrounds and expedite the progress of GBM treatment paradigms.","DOI: 10.1039/d3nr01667f

Africa.","Background: South Africa's government has made significant improvements in 
expanding access to antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. A rate of adherence of 95% 
to 100% is necessary to achieve the intended outcomes of antiretroviral 
treatment. However, antiretroviral treatment adherence remains a significant 
challenge at Helen Joseph Hospital, where an adherence rate of 51% to 59% has 
been reported.Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the factors 
associated with ARV therapy non-adherence among HIV patients at Helen Joseph 
Hospital.Method: The study used a case-control design. There were 32 570 
eligible patients for this study and 322 were selected from the overall 
population. Epi Info™ 7.2 was used to calculate the sample size. A total of 322 
questionnaires were administered to participants during their clinic visits. The 
Aids Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Questionnaire was used to measure and describe 
factors associated with ART treatment defaulting. Epi Info™ 7.2 was used to 
calculate crude odds ratios and SPSS version 26 was used to conduct multivariate 
logistic regression to compute adjusted odds ratios at 95% confidence intervals 
and p-values.Results: In total, there were 322 (100%) study participants, of 
which 51% (n = 165) were non-adherent to ARV therapy and 49% (n = 157) were 
adherent. Participants' ranged between 19 and 58 years old, with a mean age of 
34 years old and a standard deviation of 8.03 years. Treatment non-adherence was 
associated with long waiting times at Helen Joseph's Themba Lethu Clinic after 
adjusting for gender, age, educational level and employment status. The adjusted 
odds ratio was 4.78, 95% CI 1.12-20.42, and p = 0.04.Conclusion: The study 
explored factors associated with ARV treatment defaults at Helen Joseph 
hospital. The long waiting times at the hospital were strongly associated with 
non-adherence to ARV treatment. A reduction in clinic waiting times will result 
in improved adherence to ARV treatment. To reduce long waiting times, the study 
recommends a multi-month medication dispensing programme and differentiation of 
HIV care. We recommend that future research include patients and clinic managers 
(as well as other key players) in the development of solutions to reduce waiting 
times.Contribution: Helen Joseph Hospital did not view long waiting times as a 
factor that would cause a patient to default on their ARV treatment in the past. 
Helen Joseph Hospital's management team was influenced by the study results. To 
achieve an adherence rate of 95% to 100%, the hospital is reducing waiting 
times.","DOI: 10.2989/16085906.2023.2197880

concerning healthcare costs. Consequently, this study evaluated the association 
of frailty transitions with healthcare utilization and costs for older adults 
aged 70 to 84.
METHODS: This study linked the frailty status data of the Korean Frailty and 
Aging Cohort Study to the National Health Insurance Database. We included 2,291 
participants who had frailty measured by Fried Frailty phenotype at baseline in 
2016-2017 and follow-up in 2018-2019. We conducted a multivariate regression 
analysis to determine the association between their healthcare utilization and 
costs by frailty transition groups.
RESULTS: After 2 years, changes from ""pre-frail"" to ""frail"" (Group 6) and 
""frail"" to ""pre-frail"" (Group 8) were significantly associated with increased 
inpatient days (P < 0.001), inpatient frequency (P < 0.001), inpatient cost (P <

(odds ratio [OR]adjust 1.02 [1.01-1.03], P = 0.004) and EMW-FU (ORadjust 1.06 
[1.04-1.07], P < 0.001) remained as significant predictors for fatal arrhythmic 
events. Adding EMW-Baseline significantly improved the discriminating ability of 
the multivariable model including clinical variables (area under the curve [AUC] 
0.77 [0.70-0.84] vs. AUC 0.72 [0.64-0.80], P = 0.004), while a univariable model 
using EMW-FU alone showed the best performance among models (AUC 0.87 
[0.81-0.94], P = 0.060 against model with clinical variables; P = 0.030 against 
model with clinical variables and EMW-Baseline).
CONCLUSION: The EMW could effectively predict severe ventricular arrhythmia in 
ICD implanted patients. This finding supports the importance of incorporating 
the electro-mechanical coupling index into the clinical practice for predicting 
future fatal arrhythmia events.",© 2023 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.,"DOI: 10.3346/jkms.2023.38.e186

technique to manage acute postoperative pain for arthroscopic rotator cuff tear 
repair. However, rebound pain may compromise its overall benefit. Our aim was to 
investigate the primary hypothesis that perineural and intravenous dexamethasone 
have different effects on rebound pain after resolution of ISB for arthroscopic 
rotator cuff tear repair.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥ 20 years scheduled for elective arthroscopic rotator 
cuff tear repair under general anesthesia with preoperative ISB were included. 
The participants were randomized to receive dexamethasone either perineurally 
(perineural group) or intravenously (intravenous group). In the perineural 
group, patients received ISB with 12 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine containing 5 mg of 
dexamethasone; simultaneously, 1 mL of 0.9% normal saline was administered 
intravenously. In the intravenous group, patients received ISB with 12 mL of 
0.5% ropivacaine; simultaneously, 1 mL of dexamethasone 5 mg was administered 
intravenously. The primary outcome was the difference in the pain score (0-10 on 
numeric rating scale) between before and after ISB resolution. The secondary 
outcomes were the incidence of rebound pain; onset, duration, and intensity of 
rebound pain; time to the first analgesic request; and pain-related sleep 
disturbance.
RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were randomized to either perineural group (n = 
36) or intravenous group (n = 35). After block resolution, pain scores increased 
significantly more in the perineural group (mean ± standard deviation, 4.9 ± 
2.1) compared to the intravenous group (4.0 ± 1.7, P = 0.043). The duration of 
ISB was more prolonged in the perineural group (median [interquartile range], 
19.9 [17.2-23.1] hours) than the intravenous group (15.1 [13.7-15.9] hours, P < 
0.001). The incidence of rebound pain and pain-related sleep disturbance during 
the first postoperative week was significantly higher in the perineural group 
than in the intravenous group (rebound pain: 44.4% vs. 20.0%, P = 0.028; sleep 
disturbance: 55.6% vs. 25.7%, P = 0.011). The duration and intensity of rebound 
pain were similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Although perineural dexamethasone provided longer postoperative 
analgesia, intravenous dexamethasone was more beneficial in reducing pain 
increase after ISB resolution, incidence of rebound pain, and pain-related sleep 
disturbance.

mediating ethics-related conflicts and managing ethical issues arising in the 
healthcare setting. However, limited evidence exists regarding the specific 
ethical issues in clinical practice. This study aimed to explore the diverse 
ethical issues of cases referred to clinical ethics support after the new 
legislation on hospice palliative care and end-of-life decision-making was 
implemented in Korea in 2018.
METHODS: A retrospective study of cases referred to clinical ethics support at a 
university hospital in Korea from February 2018 to February 2021 was conducted. 
The ethical issues at the time of referral were analyzed via qualitative content 
analysis of the ethics consultation-related documents.
RESULTS: A total of 60 cases of 57 patients were included in the study, of whom 
52.6% were men and 56.1% were older than 60 years of age. The majority of cases 
(80%) comprised patients from the intensive care unit. One-third of the patients 
were judged as being at the end-of-life stage. The most frequent ethical 
categories were identified as goals of care/treatment (78.3%), decision-making 
(75%), relationship (41.7%), and end-of-life issues (31.7%). More specifically, 
best interests (71.7%), benefits and burdens/harms (61.7%), refusal (53.3%), and 
surrogate decision-making (33.3%), followed by withholding or withdrawal (28.3%) 
were the most frequent ethical issues reported, which became diversified by 
year. In addition, the ethical issues appeared to differ by age group and 
judgment of the end-of-life stage.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study expand the current understanding of the 
diverse ethical issues including decision-making and goals of care/treatment 
that have been referred to clinical ethics support since the enforcement of the 
new legislation in Korea. This study suggests a need for further research on the 
longitudinal exploration of ethical issues and implementation of clinical ethics

disease in paediatric patients, with infectious agents being the main cause. 
This study aimed to determine whether there are differences in the clinical 
manifestations of KD between patients with and without severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies.
METHODS: From January 1, 2021 to August 15, 2022, 82 patients with analysable 
echocardiographic data were diagnosed with KD. Twelve patients with multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children were excluded. Serologic tests were performed 
by chemiluminescence immunoassay for both the nucleocapsid (N) and the spike (S) 
proteins in blood samples. Among the 70 patients diagnosed with KD at Jeonbuk 
University Children's Hospital, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was performed in 41 
patients.
RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results for the N antigen were positive in 
12 patients, while those for S protein were positive in 14 patients. N antigen 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive KD was different from N antigen SARS-CoV-2 
antibody-negative KD in terms of sex (male predominance in the positive group, 
83.3% vs. female predominance in the negative group 62.1%, P = 0.008) and the 
incidence of refractory KD (41.7% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.034). The pro-B-type 
natriuretic peptide level was lower in the N-antigen SARS-CoV-2 
antibody-positive KD group than that in the negative group (518.9 ± 382.6, 
1,467.0 ± 2,417.6, P = 0.049). No significant differences in the 
echocardiographic findings between both groups were noted. In the multi-variable 
analysis, SARS-CoV-2 antibody (N antigen) was the only predictor of refractory 
KD (odds ratio, 13.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-115.44; P = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: High incidence of intravenous immunoglobulin-refractory KD may occur 
in up to 40% of the patients having recent history of coronavirus disease 2019.

relatively little is known about the pattern of changes in effective

abnormal alterations in resting-state effective connectivity within the Papez 
circuit and their association with cognitive decline in presbycusis patients. 
The spectral dynamic causal modelling (spDCM) approach was used for 
resting-state effective connectivity analysis in 61 presbycusis patients and 52 
healthy controls (HCs) within the Papez circuit. The hippocampus (HPC), 
mamillary body (MB), anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), anterior cingulate cortex

alteration and cognitive scale was analysed. We found that presbycusis patients 
demonstrated decreased effective connectivity from MB, PCC, and Sub to ACC 
relative to HCs, whereas higher effective connectivity strength was shown from 
HPC to MB, from ATN to PHG and from PHG to Sub. The effective connectivity from 
PHG to Sub was significantly negatively correlated with the complex figure test

reaction (OER) electrocatalysts due to their superconductivity and rich 
surface-active sites, but monometallic borides only display generic OER 
catalytic performance. Hence, iron-doped bimetallic boride nanoparticles 
(Fe-Ni2B/NF-x) on Ni foam are reported and applied as superior OER 
electrocatalysts with high catalytic activities. Such bimetallic boride 
electrocatalysts require overpotentials of only 194 and 336 mV to afford current 
densities of 10 and 500 mA cm-2 toward the OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and 
Fe-Ni2B/NF-3 can retain this catalytic stability for at least 100 h at 1.456 V. 
The performance of the improved catalyst Fe-Ni2B/NF-3 matches the best 
nickel-based OER electrocatalysts reported so far. Analysis of X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Gibbs free energy calculations show that 
Fe-doping essentially acts to modulate the electronic density of Ni2B and lower 
the free energy of O adsorption in the OER. The charge density differences and 
d-band theory proved that Fe sites have a high charge state and can be taken as 
catalytic sites for the OER. This proposed synthesis strategy provides a 
different view for preparing efficient bimetallic boride electrocatalysts.","DOI: 10.1039/d3dt00845b

contamination, but the development of efficient photocatalysts with a strong 
generalizable light response remains a challenge. CdS has a suitable energy gap 
and good response to visible light, but the photogenerated carrier separation 
efficiency is low, and the photo-corrosion phenomenon leads to the significant 
release of Cd2+. In this paper, the CdS/C60 composite photocatalyst bactericide 
is synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Testing via EIS, I-t, 
PL, and TRPL show that the C60 in the composite improves the hole-electron 
separation efficiency of CdS, resulting in a better photocatalytic performance. 
The complete inactivation of S. aureus and E. coli can be achieved within 40 min 
and 120 min, respectively, by dispersing 100 μg mL-1 of CdS/C60-2 in a diluted 
bacterial solution under simulated visible-light irradiation. Combined with ESR, 
SEM, fluorescence staining, DNA gel electrophoresis and ICP technology, it is 
believed that the high inactivation of bacteria is attributed to the ROS 
produced during the photocatalytic process, which destroy the integrity of the 
bacterial cell membrane and further destroy the DNA inside the bacteria, thus 
causing bacterial inactivation, rather than the inactivation being caused by 
Cd2+ toxicity.","DOI: 10.1039/d3tb00597f

surface levels of most proteins examined were either unaffected or increased 
during myriocin treatment, consistent with an observed decrease in bulk 
endocytosis. In contrast, sphingolipid depletion triggered selective endocytosis 
of the methionine transporter Mup1. Unlike methionine-induced Mup1 endocytosis, 
myriocin triggers Mup1 endocytosis that requires the Rsp5 adaptor Art2,

needed following its discovery have been challenging problems in the field of 
prenatal diagnosis. Herein, we describe the clinical phenotypes and various 
prenatal diagnostic processes used for two rare cases of 9p duplication 
mosaicism and review the prior literature in the field to evaluate the merits of 
different methods for diagnosing mosaic 9p duplication.
METHODS: We recorded ultrasound examinations, reported the screening and 
diagnosis pathways, and analyzed the mosaic levels of the two cases of 9p 
duplication using karyotype analysis, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (FISH).
RESULTS: Case 1 had a normal clinical phenotype for tetrasomy 9p mosaicism, and 
Case 2 showed multiple malformations caused by both trisomy 9 and trisomy 9p 
mosaicism. Both cases were initially suspected after non-invasive prenatal 
screening (NIPT) based on cell-free DNA. The mosaic ratio of 9p duplication 
found via karyotyping was lower than what was discovered by CMA and FISH, in 
both cases. Contrary to previous findings, the mosaic level of trisomy 9 found 
by karyotype analysis was greater than what was found by CMA, in terms of 
complex mosaicism involving trisomy 9 and trisomy 9p, in Case 2.
CONCLUSION: NIPT can indicate 9p duplication mosaicism during prenatal 
screening. Different strengths and limitations existed in terms of diagnosing 
mosaic 9p duplication by karyotype analysis, CMA, and FISH. The combined use of 
various methods may be capable of more accurately determining break-points and 
mosaic levels of 9p duplication during prenatal diagnosis.","© 2023 The Authors. Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine published by Wiley

including the Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) or epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) 
family proteins, sense the bending sharpness and the positive/negative sign of 
these topographical features to induce subsequent intracellular signaling. A 
number of assays have been developed to study curvature-sensing properties of 
proteins in vitro, but it is still challenging to probe low curvature regime 
with the diameter of curvature from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. It is 
particularly difficult to generate negative membrane curvatures with 
well-defined curvature values in the low curvature regime. In this work, we 
develop a nanostructure-based curvature sensing (NanoCurvS) platform that 
enables quantitative and multiplex analysis of curvature-sensitive proteins in 
the low curvature regime, in both negative and positive directions. We use 
NanoCurvS to quantitatively measure the sensing range of a negative 
curvature-sensing protein IRSp53 (an I-BAR protein) and a positive 
curvature-sensing protein FBP17 (an F-BAR protein). We find that, in cell 
lysates, the I-BAR domain of IRSp53 is able to sense shallow negative curvatures 
with the diameter-of-curvature up to 1500 nm, a range much wider than previously 
expected. NanoCurvS is also used to probe the autoinhibition effect of IRSp53 
and the phosphorylation effect of FBP17. Therefore, the NanoCurvS platform 
provides a robust, multiplex, and easy-to-use tool for quantitative analysis of

accumulated in high amounts by glandular trichomes, giving the prospect of using 
them as metabolic cell factories. Due to extremely high metabolic fluxes through 
glandular trichomes, previous research focused on how such flows are achieved. 
The question regarding their bioenergetics became even more interesting with the 
discovery of photosynthetic activity in some glandular trichomes. Despite recent 
advances, how primary metabolism contributes to the high metabolic fluxes in 
glandular trichomes is still not fully elucidated. Using computational methods 
and available multi-omics data, we first developed a quantitative framework to 
investigate the possible role of photosynthetic energy supply in terpenoid 
production and next tested experimentally the simulation-driven hypothesis. With 
this work, we provide the first reconstruction of specialised metabolism in 
Type-VI photosynthetic glandular trichomes of Solanum lycopersicum. Our model 
predicted that increasing light intensities results in a shift of carbon 
partitioning from catabolic to anabolic reactions driven by the energy 
availability of the cell. Moreover, we show the benefit of shifting between 
isoprenoid pathways under different light regimes, leading to a production of 
different classes of terpenes. Our computational predictions were confirmed in 
vivo, demonstrating a significant increase in production of monoterpenoids while 
the sesquiterpenes remained unchanged under higher light intensities. The 
outcomes of this research provide quantitative measures to assess the beneficial 
role of chloroplast in glandular trichomes for enhanced production of secondary 
metabolites and can guide the design of new experiments that aim at modulating

possess various functions including antioxidant and anticancer activities. 
However, there is little research on C-PC peptides applied for the 
neuroprotective effect against a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 
(MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model. In this study, twelve novel 
peptides from C-PC were isolated, purified and identified, and the anti-PD 
effect of the synthesized peptides was evaluated in a zebrafish PD model. As a 
result, three of these peptides (MAAAHR, MPQPPAK, and MTAAAR) significantly 
reversed the loss of dopamine neurons and cerebral vessels, and reduced the 
locomotor impairment in PD zebrafish. In addition, three novel peptides could 
inhibit the MPTP-induced decrease of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) 
and increase the ROS and protein carbonylation content. In addition, they can 
also alleviate apoptosis of brain regions and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
activity in zebrafish. Further studies elucidated the potential molecular 
mechanism of peptides' anti-PD effects in the larvae. The results showed that 
C-PC peptides could modulate multiple genes associated with oxidative stress, 
autophagy and apoptosis signaling pathways, and thereby alleviate the occurrence 
of PD symptoms. Overall, our results highlight the neuroprotective effects of 
three novel peptides and provide valuable mechanistic insights and a promising 
drug target for the treatment of PD.","DOI: 10.1039/d3fo01098h

permanent molars (molar hypomineralisation; MH), genes involved in enamel 
development and the use of medication during pregnancy in early childhood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighteen children, 54 with and 64 without 
MH, were studied. The data collected included demographics, socio-economic data 
and the medical history of mothers and children. Genomic DNA was collected from 
saliva. Genetic polymorphisms in ameloblastin (AMBN; rs4694075), enamelin (ENAM; 
rs3796704, rs7664896) and kallikrein (KLK4; rs2235091) were evaluated. These 
genes were analyzed by real time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan 
chemistry. The software PLINK was used to compare allele and genotype 
distributions of the groups and to assess the interaction between environmental 
variables and genotypes (p<0.05).
RESULTS: The variant allele KLK4 rs2235091 was associated with MH in some 
children (OR: 3.75; 95% CI=1.65-7.81; p=0.001). Taking medications in the first 
four years of life was also associated with MH (OR: 2.94; 95%CI= 1.02 -6.04; 
p=0.041), and specifically in association with polymorphisms in ENAM, AMBN and 
KLK4 (p<0.05). The use of medications during pregnancy was not associated with 
MH (OR:1.37; 95% CI= 0.593 - 3,18; p= 0.458).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that taking medication in the 
postnatal period appear to contribute to the etiology of MH in some evaluated 
children. There may be a possible genetic influence of polymorphisms in KLK4 
gene with this condition.",This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1111/ipd.13094

virus. Due to the rapid spreading of the virus and its lethal consequences, the 
WHO declared a pandemic. One of the main strategies to treat and prevent the 
spreading was the stay home safe, a social isolation situation that was 
accompanied by the closing of fitness gyms, city parks and facilities proper to 
exercise. This context promoted an increase in home fitness programs and in the 
search for information online regarding exercise and health. So, the objective 
of this study was to understand the effects of the pandemic on physical activity 
behavior and online information search regarding exercise programs. Data 
collection was through a google forms questionnaire, all procedures were 
approved by the University ethics committee and we collected data from 1065 
participants. Our results showed that the participants main behavior was 
maintained, 80.7% of our sample were active before the pandemic and only 9.7% of 
this group stopped being active. On the other hand we registered 7% of 
participants that started exercise after the pandemic installation. Information 
about exercise was searched outside social media by 49.6% of the participants 
with 32.5% using social media. 56.1% would look only for professional advice, 
interestingly 11.4% of the participants were active without any kind of advice. 
We concluded that Covid-19 pandemic installation affected negatively the 
population physical activity behavior and increased awareness about the 
importance of exercise as a health strategy.","DOI: 10.4081/ejtm.2023.11343

on dietary folate intake in severe headache patients were equivocal. Therefore, 
we conducted a cross-sectional study to elucidate the relationship between 
folate intake and severe headache. This cross-sectional study used data from 
participants over 20 years old who participated in the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2004. The diagnosis of severe 
headache was made through participants' self-report in the NHANES questionnaire 
section. We performed multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic 
spline (RCS) regression to explore the relationship between folate intake and 
severe headache. A total of 9859 participants took part in the study, 1965 of 
whom were severe headache patients and the rest were non-severe headache. We 
found that dietary folate intake was significantly and inversely associated with 
severe headache. Compared to participants with lower folate intake Q1 (≤ 229.97 
ug/day), the adjusted OR values for dietary folate intake and severe headache in 
Q2 (229.98-337 ug/day), Q3 (337.01-485 ug/day), and Q4 (≥485.01 ug/day) were

proposed metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) were each associated 
with subclinical atherosclerosis. However, there is limited evidence on risk of 
atherosclerosis in individuals who meet the criteria for one but not the other. 
We aimed to investigate the associations of MAFLD or NAFLD status with 
site-specific and multiple-site atherosclerosis.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study involving 4524 adults within the MJ 
health check-up cohort. Logistic regression model was used to estimate odds 
ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for subclinical atherosclerosis 
(elevated carotid intima-media thickness [CIMT], carotid plaque [CP], coronary 
artery calcification [CAC] and retinal atherosclerosis [RA]) associated with 
MAFLD or NAFLD status, MAFLD subtypes and fibrosis status.
RESULTS: MAFLD was associated with higher risks of elevated CIMT, CP, CAC and RA 
(OR: 1.41 [95% CI 1.18-1.68], 1.23 [1.02-1.48], 1.60 [1.24-2.08], and 1.79 
[1.28-2.52], respectively), whereas NAFLD per se did not increase risk of 
atherosclerosis except for elevated CIMT. Individuals who met both definitions 
or the definition for MAFLD but not NAFLD had higher risk of subclinical 
atherosclerosis. Among MAFLD subtypes, MAFLD with diabetes had the highest risk 
of subclinical atherosclerosis, but the associations did not differ by fibrosis 
status. Stronger positive associations were observed of MAFLD with multiple-site 
than single-site atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese adults, MAFLD was associated with subclinical 
atherosclerosis, with stronger associations for multiple-site atherosclerosis. 
More attention should be paid to MAFLD with diabetes, and MAFLD might be a 
better predictor for atherosclerotic disease than NAFLD.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/liv.15591

Extracts from the leaves or fruits of S. chinensis and their components are used 
in osteoarthritis (OA). The OA inhibitory effect of schisandrol A, one of its 
components, has been previously confirmed. We aimed to confirm the OA inhibitory 
effect of Schisandra (including components like schisandrol A) to identify why 
the inhibitory effect of the Schisandra extract is better. First, we 
investigated the effects of the Schisandra extract on OA as a potential 
therapeutic. Experimental OA was induced in a mouse model via destabilized 
medial meniscus surgery. The animals were orally administered the Schisandra 
extract; the inhibition of cartilage destruction was confirmed using 
histological analysis. In vitro analysis showed that the Schisandra extract 
attenuated osteoarthritic cartilage destruction by regulating IL-1β-induced MMP3 
and COX-2 levels. The Schisandra extract inhibited IL-1β-induced degradation of 
IκB (NF-κB pathway) and IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK 
(mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway). RNA-sequencing analysis 
showed that the Schisandra extract decreased the expression of IL-1β-induced 
MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathway-related genes more than schisandrol A alone. 
Therefore, Schisandra extract may be more effective than schisandrol A in 
preventing OA progression by regulating MAPK and NF-κB signalling.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by

in the cryopreservation of microscale biological samples such as various types 
of cells due to its fast cooling rate, significant reduction of the 
concentration of cryoprotectants, and practical liquid handling method. However, 
it is still necessary to consider the corresponding relationship between droplet 
size and concentration and the impact of crystallization during the cooling 
process on cell viability. The key may be a misunderstanding of the influencing 
factors of crystallization and vitrification behavior with concentration during 
cooling on the ultimate cell viability, which may be attributable to the 
inability to analyze the freezing state inside the microdroplets. Therefore, in 
this work, an in situ Raman observation system for droplet quenching was 
assembled to obtain Raman spectra in the frozen state, and the spectral 
characteristics of the crystallization and vitrification processes of 
microdroplets with varied concentrations and volumes were investigated. 
Furthermore, the degree of crystallization inside the droplets was 
quantitatively analyzed, and it was found that the ratio of the crystalline peak 
to hydrogen bond shoulder could clearly distinguish the degree of 
crystallization and the vitrified state, and the Raman crystallization 
characteristic parameters gradually increased with the decrease of 
concentrations. By obtaining the cooling curve and the overall cooling rate of 
quenching droplets, the vitrification state of the microdroplets was confirmed 
by theoretical analysis of the cooling characteristics of a DMSO solution 
system. In addition, the effect of cell cryopreservation was investigated using 
the microdroplet quenching device, and it was found that the key to cell 
survival during the quenching process of low-concentration microdroplets was 
dominated by the cooling rate and the internal crystallization degree, while the 
main influencing factor on high concentration was the toxic effect of a 
protective agent. In general, this work introduces a new nondestructive 
evaluation and analysis method for the cryopreservation of quenching 
microdroplets.","DOI: 10.1039/d3an00652b

somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using Tc-99m-octreotide that binds to 
somatostatin receptor-2.
METHODS: Of the 783 patients referred for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), 52 
underwent additional chest single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 
with Tc-99m-octreotide and participated in this study. In addition, 43 patients 
who underwent Tc-99m-octreotide scan for neuroendocrine tumor (NET) also 
received cardiac SPECT. Angiography was performed within 1 month after SRS for 
19 patients who showed intensive uptake in SRS and had cardiac risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 52 patients who underwent MPI and SRS, 15 showed intensive cardiac 
uptake in SRS. Moreover, of 43 patients who were referred for NET, 4 patients 
had marked cardiac uptake in SRS in the heart. Nineteen patients including 12 
women and 7 men aged 28 to 84 (58±8.04) years underwent coronary angiography. 
SRS and angiography in the left anterior descending territory were concordant in 
15/19 (79%) patients, whereas only 7/15 (46%) cases had concordant MPI and 
angiography results. In the right coronary artery territory, SRS and angiography 
were concordant in 16/19 (84%) cases, while MPI and angiography were concordant 
in 11/15 (73%) cases. In the left circumflex artery territory, SRS and 
angiography were concordant in 15/19 (79%) cases, whereas MPI and angiography 
were concordant in 6/15 (40%) cases. In the remaining 76 patients who did not 
undergo coronary angiography based on cardiovascular profile and SRS, no cardiac 
events occurred in a follow-up of 2-11 months (7.52±2.71).
CONCLUSION: Tc-99m-octreotide uptake was more concordant with coronary plaques 
relative to MPI findings, suggesting a potential role for Tc-99m-octreotide in 
the evaluation of atherosclerosis.","Publisher: AMAÇ: Bu çalışma, somatostatin reseptör-2’ye bağlanan

and 4 h compared to 2 h imaging as well as scanning up to 4 h compared to 3, and 
by this means, diagnosis reclassification or changes in diagnosis across various 
time points.
METHODS: Seventeen patients clinically suspected of gastroparesis, 8 (47.1%) men 
and 9 (52.9%) women, according to the standard procedural guidelines, underwent 
gastric emptying scintigraphy after ingesting a standard meal. One-minute static 
images in anterior and posterior projections were acquired immediately after 
ingestion and then at 1-, 2-, 3- , and 4 h time points. For image analysis, a 
manual region-of-interest was drawn, and then, count of stomach in each 
projection was used to calculate geometric mean for each time point. Decay 
correction was applied. At 2-, 3- and 4 h time points, percentage of retained 
activity was compared to standard values; therefore, each patient was labeled as 
normal or delayed.
RESULTS: Pairwise correlation between time points was statistically significant. 
Value of hour 3 shows an extremely strong correlation with the value of hour 4 
(r=0.951, p<0.001). In hour 2, of 17 participants, 11 (64.7%) were diagnosed as 
normal and 6 (35.3%) as delayed. In hour 3, the diagnosis made as delayed rose 
to 9 (52.9%), whereas normal was 8 (47.1%). Finally, in hour 4, results were 10 
(58.8%) as delayed and 7 (41.2%) as normal. All subjects who were labeled as 
delayed in hour 3 remained with the same diagnosis and 1 out of 8 subjects 
categorized as normal in hour 3 changed to delayed. For testing agreement, 
coefficient of kappa was computed between each pair. Agreement between diagnosis 
in hour 2 with hours 3 or 4 was not strong (kappa <0.6 for both pairs). However, 
a strong agreement was found between diagnosis in hours 3 and 4 (kappa: 0.881).
CONCLUSION: Because of excellent correlation between values of hours 3 and 4 and 
strong agreement between the diagnosis in those time points, extending 
acquisition from 3 to 4 h adds little to the final dai gnosis and may not be 
noticeably meaningful, especially in the clinical setting.","Publisher: AMAÇ: İkinci saatteki görüntülemeye kıyasla üçüncü ve dördüncü

was to investigate the frequency, clinical characteristics, and human leucocyte 
antigen (HLA) genotypes of idiopathic T1D.
METHODS: We enrolled 1205 newly diagnosed T1D patients in our analysis. To 
exclude monogenic diabetes in autoantibody-negative patients, we utilised a 
custom monogenic diabetes gene panel. Individuals negative for autoantibodies 
and subsequently excluded for monogenic diabetes were diagnosed with idiopathic 
T1D. We collected clinical characteristics, measured islet autoantibodies by 
radioligand assay and obtained HLA data.
RESULTS: After excluding 11 patients with monogenic diabetes, 284 cases were 
diagnosed with idiopathic T1D, accounting for 23.8% (284/1194) of all newly 
diagnosed T1D cases. When compared with autoimmune T1D, idiopathic T1D patients 
showed an older onset age, higher body mass index among adults, lower 
haemoglobin A1c, higher levels of fasting C-peptide and 2-h postprandial 
C-peptide, and were likely to have type 2 diabetes (T2D) family history and 
carry 0 susceptible HLA haplotype (all p < 0.01). A lower proportion of 
individuals carrying 2 susceptible HLA haplotypes in idiopathic T1D was observed 
in the adult-onset subgroup (15.7% vs. 38.0% in child-onset subgroup, p < 0.001) 
and in subgroup with preserved beta-cell function (11.0% vs. 30.1% in subgroup 
with poor beta-cell function, p < 0.001). Multivariable correlation analyses 
indicated that being overweight, having T2D family history and lacking 
susceptible HLA haplotypes were associated with negative autoantibodies.

a liquid. This process has been used in the manufacture of sophisticated tips. 
However, it is difficult to observe the dissolution process in the laboratory, 
and the dissolution mechanisms at the nanoscale still need to be better 
understood. Here we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to study the 
dissolution process of a meniscus-adherent nanotip. The tip apex curvature 
radius reaches its minimum in the intermediate state. The shape of this state is 
defined as the optimized shape, which can be used as the termination criterion 
in applications. In addition, the shape of one optimized tip can be well-fitted 
to a double-Boltzmann function. The upper Boltzmann curve of this function forms 
via the competition between the chemical potential influence and the 
intermolecular forces, while the formation of the lower Boltzmann curve is 
controlled by the chemical potential influence. The parameters of the 
double-Boltzmann function are strongly correlated with the nanotip's initial 
configuration and dissolubility. A shape factor ξ is proposed to characterize 
the sharpness of optimized tips. Theory and simulations show that optimized tips 
possess a greater ability to shield the capillary effect than common tips. Our 
findings elucidate the meniscus-adherent nanotip's dissolution process and 
provide theoretical support for nano-instrument manufacture.","DOI: 10.1039/d3nr00857f

the behavior of individual molecules within confined spaces. For single molecule 
analysis, the total duration of time the analyte remains within the pore/cavity 
is highly important. However, this dwell time is ruled by a complex interplay 
among particle-surface interactions, external forces on the particle and 
Brownian diffusion, making the prediction of the dwell time challenging. Here, 
we show how the dwell time of an analyte in a nanocavity that is connected to 
the external environment by two nanopore gates depends on the sizes of the 
nanocavity/nanopore, as well as particle-wall interactions. For this purpose, we 
used a coarse-grained model that allowed us to simulate hundreds of individual 
analyte trajectories within a nanocavity volume. We found that by increasing the 
attraction between the particle and the wall, the diffusion process transforms 
from a usual 3D scenario (repulsive wall) to a 2D motion along the cavity 
surface (highly attractive wall). This results in a significant reduction of the 
average dwell time. Additionally, the comparison of our results with existing 
theories on narrow escape problem allowed us to quantify the reliability of 
theory derived for ideal conditions to geometries more similar to actual 
devices.","DOI: 10.1039/d3nr01329d

ablation with 30-50 mCi radioactive iodine (RAI) and 100 mCi RAI in patients 
with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who were in the low-risk group 
according to 2015 American Thyroid Associations Classification (ATA 2015) 
criteria.
METHODS: Between February 2016 and August 2018, 100 patients who received RAI 
treatment in our clinic after total thyroidectomy and who were in the low-risk 
group DTC were included in this retrospective study. These patients were divided 
into 2 groups: low-activity (30-50 mCi) (group 1) and high-activity (100 mCi) 
(group 2). While 54 patients were treated with low activity, 46 patients 
received high activity RAI. The 2 groups were compared according to the 1st- and 
3rd-year treatment response status.
RESULTS: According to the first-year follow-up, 15 patients were accepted as 
indeterminate response and 85 patients as excellent response. Three (5.5%) of 
the patients who were accepted as indeterminate response were in group 1 and 12 
(26%) were in group 2. According to the third year follow-up, 1 patient in group 
1 and 3 patients in group 2 were accepted as indeterminate response. No 
biochemical incomplete response or recurrent disease was detected. In the 
chi-square analysis performed to investigate the relationship between the 
first-year treatment response and RAI activities, a significant relationship was 
found (p=0.004). In the Mann-Whitney U test performed to investigate the 
parameters that may be effective in the treatment response, only the preablative 
serum thyroglobulin value was shown to have a significant difference between the 
two groups (p=0.01). In the long-term follow-up of the patients, based on the 
third year treatment response data, chi-square analysis was performed to 
evaluate the two groups in terms of treatment responses, and no statistically 
significant relationship was found (p=0.73).
CONCLUSION: Ablation with 30-50 mCi can be safely applied in DTC patients who 
are in the ATA 2015 low-risk group and are planned for RAI ablation treatment.","Publisher: AMAÇ: Bu çalışmanın amacı, 2015 Amerikan Tiroid Dernekleri

endometrial cancer (EC) reduces the rate of unnecessary systemic lymph 
dissection. The aim of this study was to assess the SLN detection rate, accuracy 
of the method using Tc-99m-SENTI-SCINT and the rate of metastatic nodal 
involvement in patients with preoperative first stage EC.
METHODS: A prospective study of SLN biopsy of 41 patients with stage I EC was 
conducted after cervical application of 4mCi Tc-99m-SENTI-SCINT. Planar 
lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed 
tomography (SPECT/CT) of the pelvis were performed, followed by site-specific 
lymphadenectomy in intermediate-risk patients if no SLN was detected per 
hemipelvis and pelvic lymphadenectomy in all high-risk patients.
RESULTS: Pre-operative detection rate of planar lymphoscintigraphy was 80.49 
[95% confidence interval (CI): 68.36-92.62] and of SPECT/CT 95.12 (95% CI: 
88.52-101.7). The total intraoperative SLN detection rate was 95.12 (95% CI: 
88.52-101.7) per patient and 26.83 (95% CI: 19.91-33.75) bilaterally. The 
average number of SLNs removed was 1.6±0.8. The most common anatomical location 
of SLN was the right external iliac region. The SLN metastatic rate was 17%. 
Both sensitivity and negative predictive value regarding metastatic involvement 
were 100%.
CONCLUSION: The SLN detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value

101.5% of the initial value at 298 K, while the CIE chromaticity coordinates

peripheral neuropathy (DPN), yet evidence regarding neurological deficits and 
electromyogram is scarce. The present multi-centre study sought to investigate 
these associations based on objective quantifications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on DPN-related symptoms, signs, all diabetic 
microvascular complications, and nerve conduction abilities (quantified by nerve 
conduction amplitude and velocity, F-wave minimum latency (FML) of peripheral 
nerves) were collected from a derivation cohort of 1192 patients with type 2 
diabetes (T2D). Correlation, regression analysis, and restricted cubic splines 
(RCS) were used to explore linear and non-linear relationships between vitamin D 
and DPN, which were validated in an external cohort of 223 patients.
RESULTS: Patients with DPN showed lower levels of vitamin D than those without 
DPN; patients with vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/L) tended to suffer more 
DPN-related neurological deficits (paraesthesia, prickling, abnormal 
temperature, ankle hyporeflexia, and distal pall hypoesthesia correlating with 
MNSI-exam score (Y = -0.005306X + 2.105, P = 0.048). Worse nerve conduction 
abilities (decreased motor nerve amplitude, sensory nerve amplitude, motor nerve 
velocity, and increased FML) were also observed in these patients. Vitamin D had 
a significant threshold association with DPN (adjusted OR = 4.136, P = 0.003; 
RCS P for non-linearity = 0.003) and correlates with other microvascular 
complications (diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy).
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D is associated with the conduction ability of peripheral 
nerves and may have a nerve- and threshold-selective relationship with the 
prevalence and severity of DPN among patients with T2D.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/dmrr.3679

plays an essential role in initiating multiple immune processes. TCR sequencing 
(TCR-seq) has been developed to profile the T cell repertoire. Similar to other 
high-throughput experiments, contamination can happen during several steps of 
TCR-seq, including sample collection, preparation and sequencing. Such 
contamination creates artifacts in the data, leading to inaccurate or even 
biased results. Most existing methods assume 'clean' TCR-seq data as the 
starting point with no ability to handle data contamination. Here, we develop a 
novel statistical model to systematically detect and remove contamination in 
TCR-seq data. We summarize the observed contamination into two sources, pairwise 
and cross-cohort. For both sources, we provide visualizations and summary 
statistics to help users assess the severity of the contamination. Incorporating 
prior information from 14 existing TCR-seq datasets with minimum contamination, 
we develop a straightforward Bayesian model to statistically identify 
contaminated samples. We further provide strategies for removing the impacted 
sequences to allow for downstream analysis, thus avoiding any need to repeat 
experiments. Our proposed model shows robustness in contamination detection 
compared with a few off-the-shelf detection methods in simulation studies. We 
illustrate the use of our proposed method on two TCR-seq datasets generated 
locally.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

for the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study 
aimed to develop and assess the performance of predictive models by using a 
combination of presurgical circulating tumor cell (CTCs) data and 
clinicopathological features to screen patients at high risk of EHR to achieve 
precise decision-making.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 227 patients with recurrent HCC and 
preoperative CTC data from January 2014 to August 2019 were enrolled. All 
patients were randomly assigned to one of two cohorts: development or 
validation. Two preoperative and postoperative nomogram models for EHR 
prediction were developed and multi-dimensionally validated.
RESULTS: Patients with EHR had generally lower recurrence-free survival 
(p < 0.001), and overall survival (p < 0.001), and significantly higher CTC 
counts (epithelial CTCs, epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid CTCs, and mesenchymal 
CTCs count, all p < 0.05) than those without EHR. Univariate and multivariate 
analyses revealed that EHR was associated with four risk factors in the 
development cohort: total CTC count (p = 0.014), tumor size (p = 0.028), node 
number (p = 0.045), and microvascular invasion (p = 0.035). These factors were 
incorporated into two nomogram models (preoperative and postoperative), which 
reliably predicted EHR through multidimensional verification (e.g., calibration 
plot, receiver operating characteristic analysis, decision curve analysis, and 
clinical impact curve analysis) in the development and validation cohorts, 
respectively. With threshold of scores of 100.3 and 176.8 before and after 
surgery respectively, both nomograms were able to stratify patients into two 
distinct prognostic subgroups (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The present study proposed two nomogram models integrating 
presurgical CTC counts and clinicopathological risks and showed relatively good 
predictive performance of EHR, which may be beneficial to the clinical practice 
of HCC recurrence. Further multicenter studies are needed to assess its general 
applicability.",© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/cam4.6178

(1)Department of Psychology, San Francisco State University, CA, USA.","Background: Childhood maltreatment strongly predicts suicidality in young 
adulthood, which is increasingly common among Latina/o and Asian Americans. 
However, greater attention to modifiable explanatory factors is needed, 
particularly in ethnically minoritized populations. Aims: The current study 
evaluated whether the association between childhood maltreatment and suicidality 
may be accounted for by emotion regulation difficulties among a sample of young 
adults attending a large, minority-serving state university. Methods: Young 
adults (n = 853 participants; Mage = 22.43 years; 76.2% female) completed 
validated measures of suicidality, childhood maltreatment, depression, and 
emotion regulation difficulties. A multiple indirect effect analysis was 
conducted in a structural equation modeling framework. Results: Greater 
childhood maltreatment was associated with significantly greater emotion 
regulation difficulties across all six types and greater endorsement of overall 
suicidality. An indirect effect was found for limited access to regulation 
strategies only. Unexpectedly, lack of emotional awareness was associated with 
lower levels of ideation/attempts or threats of engaging in suicidal behavior. 
Limitations: The study was cross-sectional, precluding conclusions regarding 
causality. Conclusions: The findings suggest that, for individuals who have 
experienced childhood maltreatment, it is particularly important to address 
deficits in access to emotion regulation strategies to reduce the risk of 
suicidal ideation and behavior.","DOI: 10.1027/0227-5910/a000909

(1)University of Missouri-Kansas City and Saint Luke's Mid America Heart 
Institute, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.","Although the prevalence of heart failure has been increasing over time, the 
presentation of heart failure has been shifting, with a greater proportion of 
preserved ejection fraction and more slowly progressive symptoms that require 
recognition in the outpatient setting. These shifts have placed more of the 
diagnostic responsibility onto primary care physicians, who often are challenged 
to determine the etiology of common symptoms in patients who often have several 
other potential reasons for these symptoms. Establishing a diagnosis of heart 
failure requires a step-wise approach that includes physical exam (looking for 
multiple signs of hypervolemia), labs (B-type natriuretic peptide levels), and 
echocardiography (structural and functional measures). Diagnostic algorithms are 
particularly challenging in patients with obesity, which limits the assessment 
of intravascular volume on exam, the quality of cardiac imaging, and the 
diagnostic accuracy of B-type natriuretic peptide levels, which may be falsely 
low. In these challenging patients, the use of risk scores, invasive testing of 
intravascular volume, or empiric treatment of hypervolemia may be needed to 
determine whether symptoms are due to heart failure. Once a diagnosis of heart

body fat (BF) mass, abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous 
adipose tissue (SAT) areas compared with glimepiride in Korean patients with 
type 2 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a 52-week, multicentre, randomized, 
parallel-group, open-label, Phase IV (NCT02564926) study. Patients with 
inadequate glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin ≥7.0% and <10.0%) on 
metformin monotherapy (≥1000 mg/day) were randomized 1:1 to receive 
dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or glimepiride 1-2 mg/day for 12 months as an add-on to 
metformin. Baseline and end of study body composition evaluations included 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and abdominal computed tomography scans.
RESULTS: Of 124 enrolled patients from 14 centres, 121 received study treatment 
(dapagliflozin: 60; glimepiride: 61) and 106 (85.5%) completed the study. Over 
52 weeks, the dapagliflozin group showed the following differences versus the 
glimepiride group: -2.59 kg BF mass, -1.94% BF%, -17.55 cm2 VAT area, -18.39 cm2 
SAT area, -0.46% glycated haemoglobin, -18.25 mg/dl fasting blood glucose, 
-3.7 kg weight, -2.21 cm waist circumference, -1.37 kg/m2 body mass index, 
-6.81 mmHg systolic blood pressure and +657.71 ng/ml in adiponectin; all were 
statistically significant. Both groups had similar incidences of adverse events; 
however, hypoglycaemic events were mainly (12 of 15) reported in the glimepiride 
group.
CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin reduced total BF mass, abdominal VAT and SAT areas, 
and showed better glycaemic control than glimepiride. Being safe and 
well-tolerated, dapagliflozin appears to be a more favourable alternative to 
sulphonylureas as add-on therapy after metformin monotherapy failure in Korean 
patients with type 2 diabetes.","© 2023 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley &

problems for the population worldwide including healthcare workers. Several 
studies have assessed these using measurements for anxiety for general 
populations. The COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS) is a self-report 
measure developed to assess maladaptive forms of coping with COVID-19 
(avoidance, threat monitoring and worry) among a general adult population in the 
United States. We used it in a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 incidence 
rates in practising Canadian dentists. We therefore need to ensure that it is 
valid for dentists in French and English languages. This study aimed to evaluate 
the validity of the C-19ASS in that population.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the January 2021 monthly follow-up in our 
prospective cohort study were used. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and 
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed.
RESULTS: The results of EFA revealed a 2-factor structure solution that 
explained 47% of the total variance. The CFA showed a good model fit on the data 
in both English and French languages. The Cronbach's alpha indicated acceptable 
levels of reliability. Furthermore, the C-19ASS showed excellent divergent 
validity from the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale.
CONCLUSIONS: The C-19ASS is valid and reliable instrument to measure 
COVID-19-related anxiety in English and French among Canadian dentists.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This validated measure will contribute to understanding 
of the mental health impact of the pandemic on dentists in Canada and enable the 
dental regulatory authorities and organizations to intervene to help dentists.","© 2023 The Authors. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy published by John Wiley

considered RNAs can help predict their secondary structure. We propose an 
interactive tool for the prediction of RNA complexes, called C-RCPRed, that 
considers user knowledge and probing data (which can be generated experimentally 
or artificially). C-RCPred is based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm. 
Through an extensive benchmarking procedure, which includes state-of-the-art 
methods, we show the efficiency of the multi-objective approach and the positive 
impact of considering user knowledge and probing data on the prediction results.

attractive sensory properties, low calories, and modification ability. 
Plant-derived proteins have outstanding potential to replace animal proteins as 
they are more affordable and eco-friendly. Polysaccharide addition can improve 
the gelation properties of plant proteins. This paper aimed at critically 
analyzing the effect of the plant protein-polysaccharide compatibility on the 
characterization of composite hydrogels. H-bonds and β structures, increased by 
polysaccharides, greatly correlated with the gelation rate, superior structural 
integrity, and textural/rheological properties. Indeed, polysaccharides favored 
the transition of α-helices to β-sheets followed by the shift of amide I which 
made the microstructure dense, regular, and homogeneous. Subsequently, the 
water-holding capacity, hardness, and elastic modulus increased but the 
porosity, swelling ratio, and digestibility decreased. High protein 
concentrations increased the water-holding capacity while the swelling ratio was 
mostly dependent on polysaccharides. Polysaccharides had a protective role 
against protease penetration and gel digestibility.","DOI: 10.1039/d3fo00611e

minor chest trauma presented with pain. Chest radiography revealed a large, 
well-defined lesion on the left fourth rib, and computed tomography (CT) of the 
chest revealed a lytic lesion-type IC on the posterior and middle arches of the

without soft tissue mass extension. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging of 
the chest revealed an ovoid, expansive mass with cystic lobules and lobulated 
contours extending almost over the entire left fourth rib, measuring 134×47 mm 
in size. This mass has a low signal on T1-weighted images and a heterogeneous 
intermediate signal on T2-weighted images, with intense enhancement after 
gadolinium injection suggestive of a malignant chest tumor. A CT-guided bone 
biopsy confirmed the presence of an intramedullary lesion consisting of fibrous 
connective tissue with fusiform fibroblastic cells without atypical signs. The 
lesion was delimited by bone trabeculae with nibbled edges, indicating 
exaggerated osteoclastic activity compatible with a diagnosis of PTFOL. The

semaglutide in a real population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) over 70 years in two Spanish hospitals.
METHODS: An observational, retrospective, and multicenter clinical study was 
designed. It included 60 patients with T2DM, with a mean age of 76.5 years, 
63.3% women, and a mean of 15.5 years of evolution of T2DM, all managed in the 
outpatient clinical setting. The primary endpoint was the change in 
HbA<inf>1c</inf> from baseline to the end of the study. The secondary endpoints 
included changes in body weight and the proportion of patients achieving 
HbA<inf>1c</inf> <7.0% and body weight loss >5%.
RESULTS: After 12 months of follow-up, the reductions in HbA<inf>1c</inf> were 
-0.61±0.9% (P<0.0001) in the total cohort. Body weight reductions were -8.2±5.3 
kg (P<0.0001). Overall, 67% reached the objective of an HbA<inf>1c</inf> level 
of <7%, and 73% achieved a weight loss of ≥5%.
CONCLUSIONS: In routine clinical practice in Spain, the use of semaglutide once 
a week was associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant 
improvements in HbA<inf>1c</inf> and body weight in adults aged over 70 years 
with T2DM, without notable adverse effects, which supports real-world use.","DOI: 10.23736/S2724-6507.23.03985-4

sustainable chemistry and human welfare. In this review paper, a critical look 
at the advantages and still unsolved problems of most potential classes of green 
solvents is presented to give an overview of the current state-of-the-art in 
this field. Replacing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by ecofriendly and 
benign solvents in extractions/separations in sample preparation, as the most 
tedious and demanding step in analysis, is one of roads toward sustainable 
chemistry. Water under sub- and supercritical conditions, carbon-dioxide, ionic 
liquids (ILs), deep eutectic solvents (DESs), and those of natural origin 
(NADES) belong to the most promising classes of solvents in green analytical 
chemistry. Basic theory and mechanisms of their use illustrated by 
representative but not exhaustive list of examples related to complex matrices 
(environmental and natural food products) from analytical practice are presented 
in this review. Perspectives of QuEChERS, in line with GAC principles, are 
highlighted, in line with current trends of ""going green"" for quick, easy, 
cheap, effective, rugged, and safe analytical methods. Compliance with green 
chemistry (GC), especially green analytical chemistry (GAC) principles, is not a 
fashionable issue but, more the trend toward a sustainable future with greener 
chemistry; thus, green metrics are an unavoidable tool to measure how green the 
applied method or procedure is. Herein, the most common tools will be presented 
and discussed, such as national environmental method index (NEMI), analytical 
ecoscale, green analytical procedure index (GAPI), analytical greenness 
calculator (AGREE), complementary green analytical procedure index 
(ComplexGAPI), and analytical greenness metric for sample preparation 
(AGREEprep). The future trends for research and development in this still 
expanding field are presented in a critical view of advantages and disadvantages 
as well as improvement of the validation of analytical procedures. The creation 
of new certified reference materials (CRMs) and validated methods for specified 
analytes in complex matrices is a demanding task in the coming years. 
Tailor-made solvents with physicochemical properties for intended use are

controlled with improved oxygenation; the patient was gradually weaned from the 
ventilator and finally discharged. The possibility of immune checkpoint 
inhibitor-associated pneumonitis should be fully considered particularly for 
patients with a history of immunosuppressive therapy with clinical symptoms of 
severe pneumonitis.","Plain Language Summary: Pneumonia is well known. Immune pneumonia may be a new 
problem. It occurs in 2–5% of patients with immune therapy. It is a bad reaction 
with low incidence. If this disease is not treated in time, it will cause 
a relatively terrible result. The fatality rate can reach 12.8–22.7%. The most 
severe cases can be life threatening. At present, the reason for immune 
pneumonia is not clear. Some experts believe that it is related to immune 
change. Dyspnea, cough, fever and chest pain are symptoms of this disease. 
Although the incidence of immune pneumonia is very low, it should be noted. If 
you are on immunotherapy, consult your doctor when you feel unwell.","DOI: 10.2217/imt-2023-0030

reported to play important roles in tumor progression and metastasis. Herein, we 
investigate the oncogenic roles of B4GALNT1 for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
based on immune microenvironment.
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas database and Genotype-Tissue Expression, 
cBioportal, ImmuCellAI, TIMER2 and other databases were searched to analyze the 
expression and clinical applications of B4GALNT1 in liver cancer patients. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis were utilized. Moreover, 
western blot assay, immune histochemistry staining, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) 
assay, invasion and migration assay were performed to evaluate the function of 
B4GALNT1 in HCC.
RESULTS: B4GALNT1 is overexpressed in 14 tumors, and the mRNA expression levels 
of B4GALNT1 were remarkably elevated in most tumor types, including HCC. In 
addition, B4GALNT1 expression was an independent prognostic factor, and a low 
expression of B4GALNT1 showed a better overall survival and disease-specific 
recurrence-free survival in patients with HCC. Gene set variation analysis 
indicated that B4GALNT1 presented a positive correlation with the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway in HCC. B4GALNT1 expression was 
closely associated with immune activation genes in the HCC microenvironment. 
Moreover, B4GALNT1 expression was higher in HCC tissue than that in surrounding 
tissues. B4GALNT1 promoted the expression of apoptosis-related or EMT-related 
proteins and then decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in HCC cells, 
suggesting that B4GALNT1 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and 
invasion of HCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: B4GALNT1 may promote HCC development through regulating the EMT 
pathway, which suggests that B4GALNT1 may serve as a promising predictive 
biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/jgm.3552

acceptors as the active layer, offer exceptional promise because of excellent 
thermal stability, superior film formation, and good mechanical stress as a 
unique bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell combination. Therefore, tuning the 
molecular composition between polymers is crucial for optimizing power 
conversion efficiency (PCE) in these all-PSC systems. In this study, we 
synthesized a series of naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based random terpolymers 
P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), P(NDI-TT10), and P(NDI-2FQ10) with axisymmetric 
(BDD, TPD) and asymmetric (TT, 2FQ) electron acceptors. Compared with the blend 
morphology of PBDB-T:N2200, their diverse effects due to the addition of trace 
amounts of axisymmetric and asymmetric components were comprehensively 
investigated using physical and surface analyses and structural simulations. 
Consequently, most of our polymer acceptors demonstrated improved fill factors 
(FFs) in the optimal morphology. P(NDI-BDD10)-based devices achieved the highest 
PCE of 6.80% and FF of 69.1%, while the architecturally most asymmetric 
P(NDI-TT10)-based devices reached the lowest PCE of 4.52% despite an enhanced FF 
of 65.4%. As a result, the appropriate molecular arrangement is crucial for 
obtaining the desired morphology and improved PCE. Our findings give novel 
molecular design insight into the distinctions between axisymmetric and

diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews to select primary DTA study 
abstracts from database searches. Our goal was to develop machine-learning-based 
abstract classifiers for new DTA systematic reviews through an open competition. 
We prepared a dataset of abstracts obtained through database searches from 11 
reviews in different clinical areas. As the reference standard, we used the 
abstract lists that required manual full-text review. We randomly splitted the 
datasets into a train set, a public test set, and a private test set. 
Competition participants used the training set to develop classifiers and 
validated their classifiers using the public test set. The classifiers were 
refined based on the performance of the public test set. They could submit as 
many times as they wanted during the competition. Finally, we used the private 
test set to rank the submitted classifiers. To reduce false exclusions, we used 
the Fbeta measure with a beta set to seven for evaluating classifiers. After the 
competition, we conducted the external validation using a dataset from a 
cardiology DTA review. We received 13,774 submissions from 1429 teams or persons 
over 4 months. The top-honored classifier achieved a Fbeta score of 0.4036 and a

(1)MRC Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, 
University College London, London, UK.","BACKGROUND: The population-level summary measure is a key component of the 
estimand for clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes. This is particularly 
the case for non-inferiority trials, because different summary measures imply 
different null hypotheses. Most trials are designed using the hazard ratio as 
summary measure, but recent studies suggested that the difference in restricted 
mean survival time might be more powerful, at least in certain situations. In a 
recent letter, we conjectured that differences between summary measures can be 
explained using the concept of the non-inferiority frontier and that for a fair 
simulation comparison of summary measures, the same analysis methods, making the 
same assumptions, should be used to estimate different summary measures. The aim 
of this article is to make such a comparison between three commonly used summary 
measures: hazard ratio, difference in restricted mean survival time and 
difference in survival at a fixed time point. In addition, we aim to investigate 
the impact of using an analysis method that assumes proportional hazards on the 
operating characteristics of a trial designed with any of the three summary 
measures.
METHODS: We conduct a simulation study in the proportional hazards setting. We 
estimate difference in restricted mean survival time and difference in survival 
non-parametrically, without assuming proportional hazards. We also estimate all 
three measures parametrically, using flexible survival regression, under the 
proportional hazards assumption.
RESULTS: Comparing the hazard ratio assuming proportional hazards with the other 
summary measures not assuming proportional hazards, relative performance varies 
substantially depending on the specific scenario. Fixing the summary measure, 
assuming proportional hazards always leads to substantial power gains compared 
to using non-parametric methods. Fixing the modelling approach to flexible 
parametric regression assuming proportional hazards, difference in restricted 
mean survival time is most often the most powerful summary measure among those 
considered.
CONCLUSION: When the hazards are likely to be approximately proportional, 
reflecting this in the analysis can lead to large gains in power for difference 
in restricted mean survival time and difference in survival. The choice of 
summary measure for a non-inferiority trial with time-to-event outcomes should 
be made on clinical grounds; when any of the three summary measures discussed 
here is equally justifiable, difference in restricted mean survival time is most 
often associated with the most powerful test, on the condition that it is 
estimated under proportional hazards.","DOI: 10.1177/17407745231181907

exhibited an inverse correlation. Downregulation of RMRP significantly 
suppressed bladder cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, which was 
reversed by SCARA5 overexpression. RMRP recruited DNA methyltransferases to the 
promoter region of SCARA5, thereby triggering the methylation of the SCARA5 
promoter to epigenetically suppress its expression. Our findings elucidate the

their fabrication, atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD), featuring manifold advantages of technological interest, represent 
appealing molecule-to-material routes for which a rational precursor design is a 
critical step. In this context, the present study is focused on the coordination 
sphere engineering of three heteroleptic Ni(II) β-diketonate-diamine adducts of 
general formula [NiL2TMEDA] [L = 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,4-pentanedionate (tfa), 
2,2-dimethyl-6,6,7,7,8,8,8-heptafluoro-3,5-octanedionate (fod) or 
2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate (thd), and TMEDA = 
N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine]. Controlled variations in the diketonate 
structure are pursued to investigate the influence of steric hindrance and 
fluorination degree on the chemico-physical characteristics of the compounds. A 
multi-technique investigation supported by density functional calculations 
highlights that all complexes are air-insensitive and monomeric and that their 
thermal properties and fragmentation patterns are directly dependent on 
functional groups in the diketonate ligands. Preliminary thermal CVD experiments 
demonstrate the precursors' suitability for the obtainment of NiO films endowed 
with flat and homogeneous surfaces, paving the way to future implementation for 
CVD end-uses.","DOI: 10.1039/d3dt01282d

SARS-CoV-2, can lead to post-COVID-19 condition, a secondary syndrome of 
persistent and new post-acute symptoms, but evidence on this syndrome is still 
scarce.
METHODS: In a questionnaire survey, residents of the city of Bremen (Germany) 
with verified SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited to answer questions (online 
questionnaire or interview) concerning symptoms experienced at the time of 
infection and at the time of questionnaire completion at least three months 
later. Main outcome of the analysis was the presence of a post-COVID-19 
condition at the time of the interview, defined as the presence of at least two 
of three leading symptoms: fatigue, breathing difficulties, or cognitive 
problems.
RESULTS: A post-COVID-19 condition was more likely to be reported if respondents 
had, at the time of infection, suffered from fatigue (OR 1.75; 95% CI: 1.00, 
3.06), breathing difficulties (OR 4.02; 95% CI: 2.80, 5.77), cognitive symptoms 
(OR 2.98; 95% CI: 1.48, 6.02), or head- & bone aches (OR 2.06; 95% CI: 1.25, 
3.42). The odds of developing a post-COVID-19 condition increased with the 
number of symptoms at infection. Females were more likely to report a 
post-COVID-19 condition (OR 1.54; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.24). Analyzing only 
non-hospitalized respondents changed results only slightly.
CONCLUSION: Our study adds to growing evidence that even a mild course of 
COVID-19 poses a risk for developing a post-COVID-19 condition. Females and 
those with initial symptoms including fatigue, breathing difficulties, and 
cognitive symptoms seem more likely to also experience post COVID-19 symptoms 
several months after infection.KEY MESSAGESEven a mild course of COVID-19 poses

approach to delaying the oocyte ageing process. Onion peel extract (OPE)

this study, we investigated the effect of OPE on mouse oocyte ageing and its 
mechanism of action. The oocytes were aged in vitro in M16 medium for 16 h after 
adding OPE at different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 μg/ml). The 
addition of 100 μg/ml OPE reduced the oocyte fragmentation rate, decreased the 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, increased the glutathione (GSH) level, and 
improved the mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the control group. 
The addition of OPE also increased the expression of SOD1, CAT, and GPX3 genes, 
and the caspase-3 activity in OPE-treated aged oocytes was significantly lower 
than that in untreated aged oocytes and similar to that in fresh oocytes. These 
results indicated that OPE delayed mouse oocyte ageing by reducing oxidative 
stress and apoptosis and enhancing mitochondrial function.","DOI: 10.1017/S0967199423000199

as a tool for resurgence mitigation have provided limited and unclear results. 
Thus, the present experiments were designed to investigate the effect of

using rat subjects. In two experiments, following a baseline phase in which a 
target response was trained, groups of rats experienced concurrent (i.e., five 
simultaneous alternative responses), serial (i.e., five sequentially available 
alternative responses), or single DRA interventions arranging similar rates of 
alternative reinforcement in order to examine potential differences in 
resurgence. Both experiments showed that neither serial nor concurrent DRA 
expanded-operant treatments reduced resurgence compared with single DRA 
regardless of whether stimuli associated with previously reinforced alternative 
responses were removed (Experiment 1) or remained present (Experiment 2) for the 
serial-DRA group. Further, a primacy effect in resurgence was obtained for the

Here, a simple, biocompatible, and universal strategy based on cell 
surface-anchored specific DNAzymes and hybridization chain reaction enzyme-free 
signal amplification for cellular microenvironment electrochemical detection is 
presented. In this strategy, the cell could be captured on the surface of the 
electrode via aptamer-target recognition. On the other hand, the DNAzyme 
hybridized with the substrate strand as a metal ion probe was anchored on the 
surface of the cell. In the presence of metal ions, the substrate strand could 
be cleaved into two fragments by the DNAzyme and released from the cell surface. 
Then, the DNA modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) could be captured on the 
electrode. Subsequently, an alternative hybridization reaction of two hairpin 
probes was triggered by the carried initiators forming nicked double helices. 
For signal readout, hemin could be inserted into the double-helix DNA long chain 
via electrostatic interaction, which could electro-reduce hydrogen peroxide to 
generate an electrochemical signal. Based on the intrinsic advantages of 
DNAzymes, including rapid kinetics, high sensitivity, and high selectivity, and 
the signal amplification strategy, this method should be able to monitor and 
semi-quantify target metal ions in the cellular microenvironment. Furthermore,

of agmatine (AGM) could effectively reduce motor and cognitive deficits induced 
by bile duct ligation (BDL) in an animal model of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) 
through neuroprotective mechanisms.
METHODS: The Wistar rats were divided into four groups: sham, BDL, BDL+ 40 mg/kg 
AGM, and BDL+ 80 mg/kg AGM. The BDL rats were treated with AGM from 2 weeks 
after the surgery for 4 consecutive weeks. The open field, rotarod, and wire 
grip tests were used to assess motor function and muscle strength. The novel 
object recognition test (NOR) was performed to evaluate learning and memory. 
Finally, blood samples were collected for the analysis of the liver markers, the 
animals were sacrificed, and brain tissues were removed; the CA1 regions of the 
hippocampus and cerebellum were processed to identify apoptosis and neuronal 
damage rate using caspase-3 immunocytochemistry and Nissl staining.
RESULTS: The serological assay results showed that BDL severely impaired the 
function of the liver. Based on histochemical findings, BDL increased the 
neuronal damage in CA1 and Purkinje cells, whereas apoptosis was significantly 
observed only in the cerebellum. AGM treatment prevented the increase of serum 
liver enzymes, balance deficits, and neuronal damage in the brain areas. 
Apoptosis partially decreased by AGM, and there were no differences in the 
performance of animals in different groups in the NOR.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests AGM as a potential treatment candidate for HE 
because of its neuroprotective properties and/or its direct effects on liver 
function.",© 2023 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1002/brb3.3124

and physiological processes, and play an important role in regulating gene 
expression in all cells, especially in most animal cells, including oocytes and 
embryos. The expression of miRNAs at the right time and place is crucial for the 
oocyte's maturation and the embryo's subsequent development. Although assisted 
reproductive techniques (ART) have helped to solve many infertility problems, 
they cause changes in the expression of miRNA and genes in oocytes and 
preimplantation embryos, and the effect of these changes on the future of 
offspring is unknown, and has caused concerns. The relevant genomic alterations 
commonly imposed on embryos during cryopreservation may have potential 
epigenetic risks. Understanding the biological functions of miRNAs in frozen 
maturated oocytes may provide a better understanding of embryonic development 
and a comparison of fertility conservation in female mammals. With the 
development of new techniques for genomic evaluation of preimplantation embryos, 
it has been possible to better understand the effects of ART. The results of 
various articles have shown that freezing of oocytes and the cryopreservation 
method are effective for the expression of miRNAs and, in some cases, cause 
changes in the expression of miRNAs and epigenetic changes in the resulting 
embryo. This literature review study aimed to investigate the effects of oocyte

'solvent-to-chromophore' proton transfer (ESPT) in the isolated gas phase PBI 
(2,2'-pyridylbenzimidazole)-CH3OH complex, aided by computational calculations. 
The binary complexes of PBI with CH3OH/CH3OD were produced in a supersonic 
jet-cooled molecular beam and the energy barrier of the photo-excited process 
was determined using resonant two-colour two-photon ionization spectroscopy 
(R2PI). The ESPT process in the PBI-CH3OH complex was confirmed by the 
disappearance of the Franck-Condon active vibrational transitions above 000 + 
390 cm-1. In the PBI-CH3OD complex, the reappearance of the Franck-Condon 
transitions till 000 + 800 cm-1 confirmed the elevation of the ESPT barrier upon 
isotopic substitution due to the lowering of the zero-point vibrational energy. 
The ESPT energy barrier in PBI-CH3OH was bracketed as 410 ± 20 cm-1 (4.91 ± 0.23 
kJ mol-1) by comparing the spectra of PBI-CH3OH and PBI-CH3OD. The 
solvent-to-chromophore proton transfer was confirmed based on the significantly 
decreased quantum tunnelling of the solvent proton in the PBI-CH3OD complex. The 
computational investigation resulted in an energy barrier of 6.0 kJ mol-1 for 
the ESPT reaction in the PBI-CH3OH complex, showing excellent agreement with the 
experimental value. Overall, the excited state reaction progressed through an 
intersection of ππ* and nπ* states before being deactivated to the ground state 
via internal conversion. The present investigation reveals a novel reaction 
pathway for the deactivation mechanism of the photo-excited N-containing 
biomolecules in the presence of protic-solvents.","DOI: 10.1039/d3cp01742g

traditional protocol involves covering a pre-prepared hydrogel sensor on a 
tested surface. As a result, the sensor cannot achieve self-adaptive adhesion 
owing to an air-layer hindrance between the sensor and tested surface, which 
inevitably leads to the loss of critical biological signals. To address the 
issue of air-layer hindrance, this work proposes an in situ permeation method 
that enables the self-adaptive adhesion of hydrogel biosensors on various 
surfaces. After applying a liquid solution of poly(methacrylamido propyl 
trimethyl ammonium chloride-co-acrylamide) (poly(MPTAC-co-AM)) on the testing 
surface, a thin film of poly(acrylic aminoethane sulfonic acid-co-acrylamide) 
(poly(AASA-co-AM)) is applied, where the electrostatic interaction between -SO3- 
and -Me3N+ facilitates rapid permeation of the solution into the solid film, 
leading to the formation of a hydrogel layer in situ. The coating of liquid 
poly(MPTAC-co-AM) sweeps away the air layer and works as a natural glue, 
enabling a strong bonding interaction between the hydrogel layer and the tested 
surface. Such a hydrogel layer is very thin (microscale), and can retain its 
self-adaptive adhesion even with deformation of the tested surface. When it is 
applied on the surface of an active frog heart, the weak heartbeats can be 
transduced to electrical signals. Moreover, this self-adaptive adhesion can work 
on both soft and hard surfaces including biological tissues, metals, rubbers, 
ceramics, and glass. Therefore, this in situ permeation method enables the 
hydrogel layer to detect weak dynamic changes on various soft and hard surfaces, 
which might offer a new pathway for physiological signal monitoring.","DOI: 10.1039/d3mh00597f

eradicate transformed cells. Their activation without a need for additional 
signaling have attracted great attention on the use of NK cells as a promising 
option in cancer immunotherapy. However, the large-scale production of NK cells 
for successful NK cells therapy is a challenge that needs to be tackled. 
Engineering NK cells to avoid tumor escape and improve their antitumor potency 
are the other matters of focus that have widely been studied in the recent 
years. This paper reviews the most recent advances in the stem cell-derived NK 
cell technology and discusses the potential of the engineered NK cells for 
clinical applications in cancer immunotherapy.","Plain Language Summary: NK cells are important cells in our body's defense 
system that can find and destroy tumor cells. These cells are made in bone 
marrow (in adults) or umbilical cord (in the embryonic period) from a population 
of cells called stem cells, and then released into the blood and lymph. Stem 
cells are the early ancestral cells that can differentiate into multiple cell 
types. Because the number and function of NK cells in a tumor context are 
reduced, thus we can use these stem cells to make lots of NK cells for treatment 
purposes. Scientists can also make these cells even better at killing tumors by 
changing them to have special sensors. In the end, NK cells are like superheroes 
that fight and kill tumor cells, and using stem cells to make them is a really 
promising way to help treat malignant diseases.","DOI: 10.2217/imt-2022-0224

promising accurate therapeutic agents. However, their complex preparations risk 
compromising the targeting ability of the fragment antigen binding (Fab) region 
and promote aggregation over long-term storage. Here, we propose a 
tumor-active-targeting nanomedicine, aPDL1-PLG-MMAE, that effectively targets 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) high-expressing tumors and delivers monomethyl 
auristatin E (MMAE). aPDL1-PLG-MMAE consists of an anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody 
(aPDL1) and poly(L-glutamic acid) (PLG) grafted Fc-III-4C 
peptide/Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE (Fc-PLG-MMAE). Fc-PLG-MMAE was obtained by conjugating 
the Fc-III-4C peptide and Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE to PLG via amide condensation. The 
strong affinity between the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of aPDL1 and the 
Fc-III-4C peptide enabled aPDL1 and Fc-PLG-MMAE to self-assemble into 
aPDL1-PLG-MMAE after four hours of coincubation in PBS. As this nanomedicine can 
be quickly prepared for immediate use, the required antibodies can be stored 
separately from the Fc-PLG-MMAE portion for extended periods, which also 
facilitates transport. Moreover, aPDL1-PLG-MMAE demonstrated robust tumor 
recognition and targeting effects on MC38 colon cancer cells, resulting in 
potent therapeutic efficacy without significant toxicities.","DOI: 10.1039/d3bm00664f

treatment of various cancers, has multiple mechanisms of action, including 
nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) damage and cytoskeletal

synchrony but induces right ventricular conduction delay (RVCD). Although 
anodal-ring capture (ARC) during bipolar LBBP improves RVCD, it is not achieved 
in all patients receiving LBBP. This study aimed to analyze the factors 
influencing ARC implementation.
METHODS: Patients receiving LBBP with intraoperative ARC testing were enrolled. 
Electrocardiographic parameters were measured, including stimulus-to-QRS 
duration (stim-QRSd), stimulus-to-left/right ventricular activation time 
(stim-LVAT/RVAT), and V6-V1 interpeak interval. The distribution of lead-tip 
sites was described as the corrected longitudinal and lateral distance 
(longit-/lat-dist). Relative angles of the LBBP lead were measured. 
Echocardiography in short axis view was used to measured the intra-septal lead 
length. Intergroup comparisons, correlation analysis, and stepwise logistic 
regression were performed.
RESULTS: Totally 105 patients were included, among which 65 (62%) patients 
achieved ARC at a pacing output ≤ 5.0 V/0.5ms (average 3.1 V/0.5ms). ARC further 
shortened the stim-QRSd by 13.1 ± 7.5 ms. Better unipolar-ring (cathodal) 
threshold and R-wave sensing in LBBP-ARC group indicated the critical role of 
ring-septum contact in ARC. Longer corrected longit-dist and shorter corrected 
lat-dist of lead-tip sites were positively correlated with higher success 
likelihood of ARC, likely due to the greater relative angle in which the lead 
entering the septum and consequently the longer intra-septal lead length and 
better ring-septum contact.
CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated the factors affecting the success likelihood 
of LBBP-ARC. These findings improve the understanding of LBBP-ARC, providing 
references for future research and clinical practice.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

this question by two young and esteemed specialist in orthodontics of my 
research group, actually PhD students, who showed me a laptop screen. ""No, I 
have never seen anything so potentially extraordinary. But doubts arise: is this 
legal? Or rather, is it ethical for us to use it in the field of research?"" So I 
asked the questioners, Dr. Serafin and Dr. Bocchieri, to write a short essay on 
this new form of artificial intelligence, the chatbots, to give me an idea of 
what they are, what their potential is, and how they can change the veracity of 
data when an artificial mind replaces a human one. After ""letterally"" 5 minutes, 
they returned to me and let me read the following: The rapid advancement of 
artificial intelligence (AI) technology has led to a proliferation of AI-powered 
tools that are having a significant impact in the realm of academic writing to 
automate various aspects of the editorial process, from research to proofreading 
and even generating complete high-quality scientific articles. Chatbots are 
AI-virtual assistants that offer significant benefits but there are also 
important ethical considerations that must be considered. One concern is related 
to the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content, particularly in 
scientific writing where accuracy is of utmost importance. There are also 
concerns about the potential for AI to be used to produce plagiarized or 
fraudulent content, which could undermine the credibility of scientific 
soundness. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to establish clear guidelines 
and regulations for their use. Additionally, academic institutions and 
publishers should take steps to verify the authenticity of authors and promote 
transparency and accountability in the publishing process. The use of chatbots 
in academic writing has the potential to revolutionize the way in which research 
is conducted and written. However, it is important to ensure that the ethical 
implications of this technology are carefully considered and addressed. This 
includes ensuring that AI-generated content is accurate, reliable, and 
trustworthy and that the use of AI does not result in the displacement of human 
imagination. To address these ethical considerations, it is recommended that 
academic institutions and scientific journals work together to establish clear 
guidelines and regulations for the use of AI in academic writing, ensuring that 
AI-powered tools are ethical. By taking a responsible approach, we can ensure 
that the benefits of this technology are realized while minimizing any potential 
negative consequences. Finally, the most important but missing information is 
that this editorial is fully written by a chatbot. Therefore, pay attention: the 
search for health for our patients must go through scientific honesty that 
produces data and analyzes them ""humanly"". I share my amazement, but also my 
concern. As a university professor, as a clinician, as a researcher, but also as 
a ""father"" of future orthodontists, I always have doubts about the message we 
want to leave, and in this editorial I would like to reproduce an excerpt from a

craniofacial morphology in GGS patients in order to enable an early diagnosis.
BACKGROUND: Gorlin-Goltz syndrome (GGS) is a autosomic dominant disease, 
characterised by basal cell carcinoma, palmar/plantar pits, maxillary and 
mandibular keratocysts and dental abnormalities.
METHODS: Nine out of a sample of 24 GGS patients had complete cephalometric and 
photographic records at an average age of 8.7 years. Cephalometric and 
photometric analysis were carried out with standard analyses and compared with 
healthy patients matched for sex and age.
CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of GGS based on clinical features could be useful to 
identify the presence of keratocysts through x-ray examination proceeding with 
surgical removal at an early stage, limiting space occupying damages.","DOI: 10.23804/ejpd.2023.24.02.03

approach to the dental care of young patients, considering not only their oral 
care needs, but also the management of their behaviour, that is intrinsic to 
their life needs and to those of their families.
CASE REPORT: This approach to dental care management stems from a thorough 
evaluation of the patient, the reason for dental visit, whether the child had 
previous dental visit(s), which might not have been positive, the family 
involvement and the emotional characteristics of the child and their parents. We 
should design a progressive customized path, sometimes starting only from 
secondary prevention in order to ""comfortably"" avoid the worsening of a given 
clinical condition, stimulate a concomitant positive behavioural response of all 
parties involved, until the child and their family are ready to take the next 
step, in terms of integrated restorative dentistry and/or paediatric 
orthodontics, where and when needed.
CONCLUSION: ""The teeth come after"" means that dental and oral care of the 
children may not be achievable goals unless we first address their wellbeing and 
that of their families, and that sometimes ""the perfect is the enemy of the 
good"", especially when we incorrectly consider only the clinical outcome. In 
this scenario, psychological skills and clinical feelings, comfort techniques, 
technologies, new materials and a more ""medical less"" surgical approaches are 
the bases for a child/family-oriented approach.","DOI: 10.23804/ejpd.2023.24.02.02

associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the effectiveness 
of catheter-based ablation, periprocedural complication and recurrences remain a 
concern. In this context, we aim to appraise the potential impact of 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on reducing episodes of paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation (PAF).
METHODS: 22 patients with an established diagnosis of PAF and without structural 
heart disease were considered. Every patient received 20 drops of GUNA-BDNF 
administered in the morning. During the 24 months of follow-up, the arrhythmic 
burden was measured by the average monthly duration of PAF episodes.
RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period (24 months), data from 22 patients, 
of whom 17 men and five women, were analyzed. The arrhythmic burden, measured in 
terms of average monthly duration of PAF episodes, was found significantly 
reduced after the administration of low dose BDNF (9.5 vs. 65.3 minutes per 
month, P<0.001). A total of 17 out of 22 patients saw their arrhythmic burden 
eliminated or consistently reduced, furthermore two patients underwent a drastic 
reduction of the average monthly duration of AF (more than 200 minutes compared 
to the baseline). Only four patients, despite the administration of BDNF, still 
experienced an arrhythmic burden of 20 minutes or more. Considering the age 
groups, the major reduction was observed in people aged 70 or more, who were 
also the most represented in the sample. These results are coherent with the 
poor literature currently available.
CONCLUSIONS: BDNF low dose therapy has shown to have an impacting role in 
reducing the arrhythmic burden and recurrences of AF, with a particular 
effectiveness in patients over 70 and without structural heart disease. We 
should welcome this work, despite it limitations. Further clinical and molecular 
studies are needed before-considering BDNF low dose as a tool against PAF.","DOI: 10.23736/S2724-5683.23.06324-X

arrest (OHCA) patients is characterized by inflammatory response. We conducted a 
scoping review of current evidence regarding several inflammatory markers' 
usefulness for assessment of patient outcome and illness severity. We also 
discuss the proposed underlying mechanisms leading to inflammatory response 
after OHCA.
METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Cochrane CENTRAL and Web of 
Science Core Collection databases with the following search terms: 
(""inflammation"" OR ""cytokines"") AND ""out-of-hospital cardiac arrest."" Each 
inflammatory marker found was combined with ""out-of-hospital cardiac arrest"" 
using ""AND"" to find further relevant studies. We included original studies 
measuring inflammatory markers in adult OHCA patients that assessed their 
prognostic capabilities for mortality, neurological outcome, or organ failure 
severity.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria, covering in total 65 
different markers. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive 
protein (CRP) were the most studied markers, and they were associated with poor 
outcomes in 13/15, 13/14 and 11/17 studies, respectively. Based on area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value, the time point of best 
discriminatory capacity for poor outcome was ICU admission for IL-6 (median AUC 
0.78, range 0.71-0.98) and day one after OHCA for PCT (median AUC 0.84, range 
0.61-0.98). Seven studies reported AUCs for CRP (range 0.52-0.76) with no 
measurement time point being superior to others. The association of IL-6 and PCT 
with outcome appeared stronger in studies with more severely ill patients. 
Studies reported conflicting results regarding each marker's association with 
organ failure severity.
CONCLUSION: Inflammatory markers are potentially useful for early risk 
stratification after OHCA. PCT and IL-6 have moderate prognostic value during 
the first 24 h of the ICU stay. Predictive accuracy appears to be associated 
with the study overall event rate.","© 2023 The Authors. Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica published by John Wiley

drainage to prevent fluid overload after neonatal cardiac surgery is common in 
some centres; however, the multi-centre variability and details of peritoneal 
catheter use are not well described.
METHODS: Twenty-two-centre NEonatal and Pediatric Heart Renal Outcomes Network 
(NEPHRON) study to describe multi-centre peritoneal catheter use after STAT 
category 3-5 neonatal cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Patient 
characteristics and acute kidney injury/fluid outcomes for six post-operative 
days are described among three cohorts: peritoneal catheter with dialysis, 
peritoneal catheter with passive drainage, and no peritoneal catheter.
RESULTS: Of 1490 neonates, 471 (32%) had an intraoperative peritoneal catheter 
placed; 177 (12%) received prophylactic dialysis and 294 (20%) received passive 
drainage. Sixteen (73%) centres used peritoneal catheter at some frequency, 
including six centres in >50% of neonates. Four centres utilised prophylactic 
peritoneal dialysis. Time to post-operative dialysis initiation was 3 hours [1, 
5] with the duration of 56 hours [37, 90]; passive drainage cohort drained for 
92 hours [64, 163]. Peritoneal catheter were more common among patients 
receiving pre-operative mechanical ventilation, single ventricle physiology, and 
higher complexity surgery. There was no association with adverse events. Serum 
creatinine and daily fluid balance were not clinically different on any 
post-operative day. Mortality was similar.
CONCLUSIONS: In neonates undergoing complex cardiac surgery, peritoneal catheter 
use is not rare, with substantial variability among centres. Peritoneal 
catheters are used more commonly with higher surgical complexity. Adverse event 
rates, including mortality, are not different with peritoneal catheter use. 
Fluid overload and creatinine-based acute kidney injury rates are not different 
in peritoneal catheter cohorts.","DOI: 10.1017/S104795112300135X

identification of small- and large-for-gestational age (SGA and LGA) infants 
remain contentious, despite the recent creation of the Intergrowth 21st Project 
and World Health Organisation (WHO) birthweight-for-gestational age standards.
OBJECTIVE: We carried out a study to identify birthweight-for-gestational age 
cut-offs, and corresponding population-based, Intergrowth 21st and WHO centiles 
associated with higher risks of adverse neonatal outcomes, and to evaluate their 
ability to predict serious neonatal morbidity and neonatal mortality (SNMM) at 
term gestation.
METHODS: The study population was based on non-anomalous, singleton live births 
between 37 and 41 weeks' gestation in the United States from 2003 to 2017. SNMM 
included 5-min Apgar score <4, neonatal seizures, need for assisted ventilation, 
and neonatal death. Birthweight-specific SNMM was modelled by gestational week 
using penalised B-splines. The birthweights at which SNMM odds were minimised 
(and higher by 10%, 50% and 100%) were estimated, and the corresponding 
population, Intergrowth 21st, and WHO centiles were identified. The clinical 
performance and population impact of these cut-offs for predicting SNMM were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The study included 40,179,663 live births and 991,486 SNMM cases. Among 
female singletons at 39 weeks' gestation, SNMM odds was lowest at 3203 g 
birthweight, and 10% higher at 2835 g and 3685 g (population centiles 11th and 
82nd, Intergrowth centiles 17th and 88th and WHO centiles 15th and 85th). 
Birthweight cut-offs were poor predictors of SNMM, for example, the cut-offs 
associated with 10% and 50% higher odds of SNMM among female singletons at 
39 weeks' gestation resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, and population 
attributable fraction of 12.5%, 89.4%, and 2.1%, and 2.9%, 98.4% and 1.3%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Reference- and standard-based birthweight-for-gestational age 
indices and centiles perform poorly for predicting adverse neonatal outcomes in 
individual infants, and their associated population impact is also small.","© 2023 The Authors. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology published by John

as it has implications for several evolutionary phenomena including the 
evolution of sex and mating systems, the rate of adaptive evolution, and the 
prevalence of deleterious mutations. Despite the distribution of fitness effects 
being extensively studied, the effects of strongly deleterious mutations are 
difficult to infer since such mutations are unlikely to be present in a sample 
of haplotypes, so genetic data may contain very little information about them. 
Recent work has attempted to correct for this issue by expanding the classic 
gamma-distributed model to explicitly account for strongly deleterious 
mutations. Here, we use simulations to investigate one such method, adding a 
parameter (plth) to capture the proportion of strongly deleterious mutations. We 
show that plth can improve the model fit when applied to individual species but 
underestimates the true proportion of strongly deleterious mutations. The 
parameter can also artificially maximize the likelihood when used to jointly 
infer a distribution of fitness effects from multiple species. As plth and 
related parameters are used in current inference algorithms, our results are 
relevant with respect to avoiding model artifacts and improving future tools for 
inferring the distribution of fitness effects.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The

may predict longer-term ablation outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 688 patients with persistent AF undergoing catheter ablation 
were included from the DECAAF II trial database. The primary endpoint of the 
study was the first confirmed recurrence of atrial arrhythmia. Recurrence was 
also monitored during the 90-day blanking period.
RESULTS: A total of 287 patients experienced recurrent atrial arrhythmia during 
the blanking period, while 401 remained in sinus rhythm. Rates of longer-term 
arrhythmia recurrence were substantially higher among those who developed 
recurrence during the blanking period compared to those who remained in sinus 
rhythm throughout the blanking period (68% vs. 32%, p < 0.001). The study cohort 
was divided into three groups according to the timing of arrhythmia recurrence 
during the blanking period. Of those who had recurrent arrhythmia during the 
first month of the blanking period (Group 1) 43.9% experienced longer-term 
recurrence, compared to 61.6% who recurred during the second month of the 
blanking period (Group 2), and 93.3% of those who had arrhythmia recurrence 
during the third month (Group 3, p < 0.001). The risk of recurrent arrhythmia 
was highest in patients in patients in Group 3 (HR = 10.15), followed by Group 2 
(HR = 2.35) and Group 1 (HR = 1.5). ROC analysis was performed to assess the 
relationship between the timing of arrhythmia recurrence and the primary outcome 
(AUC = 0.746, p < 0.001). The optimal blanking period duration was identified as 
34 days. Atrial fibrillation burden determined by smartphone ECG technology over

induced by administration of NTG. All study visits took place in a dedicated 
clinical research facility housing a monitoring area with clinical beds next to 
a 3Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Fifty-three patients with migraine 
were enrolled; imaging on at least one triggered visit was obtained from 25 
patients, with 21 patients completing the entire imaging protocol including a 
placebo visit. Whole brain CBF maps were acquired using 3D pseudo-continuous 
arterial spin labeling (3D pCASL).
RESULTS: The primary outcome was that patients with migraine not taking 
preventive treatment (n = 12) displayed significant increases in CBF in anterior 
cingulate cortex, caudate, midbrain, lentiform, amygdala and hippocampus 
(p < 0.05 family-wise error-corrected) during NTG-induced PS. A separate region 
of interest analysis revealed significant CBF increases in the region of the 
hypothalamus (p = 0.006, effect size 0.77). Post hoc analyses revealed 
significant reductions in CBF over the occipital cortices in participants with a 
history of migraine with underlying aura (n = 14).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified significant regional CBF changes associated with 
NTG-induced PS, consistent with other investigations and with novel findings, 
withstanding statistical comparison against placebo. These findings were not 
present in patients who continually took preventive medication. Additional 
findings were identified only in participants who experience migraine with aura. 
Understanding this biological and treatment-related heterogeneity is vital to 
evaluating functional imaging outcomes in migraine research.","© 2023 The Authors. Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain published by

(1)Department of Anatomy, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Otago,

counts but there is no clear consensus on whether AMH is indicative of 
primordial follicle counts in humans. Mice were used as a model species in this 
study to obtain accurate follicle counts across the reproductive phase of life. 
Serum AMH was measured in 62 female C57Bl6/J mice aged 25-401-days-old. 
Primordial and primary follicles were determined by stereological counts and all 
secondary and antral follicles were counted in serial histological sections. 
Serum AMH was most strongly correlated with small- and medium-sized antral 
follicles Immunohistochemistry and stepwise multiple-regression confirmed that 
these follicle development stages are the key determinants of serum AMH, with 
little contribution from other stages. Primordial follicles were not found to 
have strong correlations with serum AMH or antral follicle counts, particularly 
in younger females, but the strength of the association appeared to increase 
with age. This result is likely attributed to high interindividual variation in 
primordial follicle activation and preantral follicle survival rates. Recent 
large studies in human populations have shown similar results but the primary 
limitation of these studies was that primordial follicle counts were determined 
from ovarian cortical biopsies, where regional variation in follicle 
distribution may affect the quality of the data. In the present study, whole 
ovaries were surveyed which eliminated this limitation. The findings indicate 
that primordial follicle counts are not closely related with either serum AMH or 
antral follicle counts in females in the early phase of the reproductive phase 
of life.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

(Theobroma cacao) in the Western hemisphere. M. roreri is considered asexual and 
haploid throughout its hemibiotrophic lifecycle. To understand the processes 
driving genome modification, using long-read sequencing technology we sequenced 
and assembled five high quality M. roreri genomes out of a collection of 
ninety-nine isolates collected throughout the pathogen's range. We obtained 
chromosome-scale assemblies composed of eleven scaffolds. We used short-read 
technology to sequence the genomes of twenty-two similarly chosen isolates. 
Alignments among the five reference assemblies revealed inversions, 
translocations, and duplications between and within scaffolds. Isolates at the 
front of the pathogens' expanding range tend to share lineage-specific 
structural variants, as confirmed by short-read sequencing. We identified, for 
the first time, three new mating type A locus alleles (five in total) and one 
new potential mating type B locus allele (three in total). Currently only two 
mating type combinations, A1B1 and A2B2, are known to exist outside of Colombia. 
A systematic survey of the M. roreri transcriptome across twenty-two isolates 
identified an expanded candidate effector pool and provided evidence that 
effector candidate genes unique to the Moniliophthoras are preferentially 
expressed during the biotrophic phase of disease. Notably, M. roreri isolates in 
Costa Rica carry a chromosome segment duplication that has doubled the 
associated gene complement and includes secreted proteins and candidate 
effectors. Clonal reproduction of the haploid M. roreri genome has allowed

use disorder (MOUD) and health care utilization over time among a sample of 
treatment-seeking individuals with opioid use disorder. In contrast to previous 
studies, this study used a novel measure of MOUD adherence, more comprehensive 
utilization data, and analyses that controlled for detailed individual and 
social determinants of health.
METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a comparative effectiveness 
trial (N=570) of extended-release naltrexone versus buprenorphine-naloxone. The 
outcome of interest was usage of nonstudy acute care, inpatient and outpatient 
addiction services, and other outpatient services across 36 weeks of assessment. 
Adherence (percentage of days taking MOUD) was defined as low (<20%), medium 
(≥20% but <80%), or high (≥80%). A two-part model evaluated the probability of 
utilizing a resource and the quantity (utilization days) of the resource 
consumed. A time-varying approach was used to examine the effect of adherence in 
a given month on utilization in the same month, with analyses controlling for a 
wide range of person-level characteristics.
RESULTS: Participants with high adherence (vs. low) were significantly less 
likely to use inpatient addiction (p<0.001) and acute care (p<0.001) services 
and significantly more likely to engage in outpatient addiction (p=0.045) and 
other outpatient (p=0.042) services.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the understanding that greater MOUD 
adherence is associated with reduced usage of high-cost health services and 
increased usage of outpatient care. The results further suggest the need for 
enhanced access to MOUD and for interventions that improve adherence.","DOI: 10.1176/appi.ps.20220549

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), the commonest inherited peripheral 
neuropathy, is due to a genomic duplication encompassing the dosage-sensitive 
PMP22 gene. MicroRNAs act as repressors on post-transcriptional regulation of 
gene expression and in rodent models of CMT1A, overexpression of one such 
microRNA (miR-29a) has been shown to reduce the PMP22 transcript and protein 
level. Here we present genomic and functional evidence, for the first time in a 
human CNV-associated phenotype, of the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR)-mediated 
role of microRNA repression on gene expression. The proband of the family 
presented with an early-onset, severe sensorimotor demyelinating neuropathy and 
harboured a novel de novo deletion in the PMP22 3'-UTR. The deletion is 
predicted to include the miR-29a seed binding site and transcript analysis of 
dermal myelinated nerve fibres using a novel platform, revealed a marked 
increase in PMP22 transcript levels. Functional evidence from Schwann cell lines 
harbouring the wildtype and mutant 3'-UTR showed significantly increased 
reporter assay activity in the latter which was not ameliorated by 
overexpression of a miR-29a mimic. This shows the importance of miR-29a in 
regulating PMP22 expression and opens an avenue for therapeutic drug 
development.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

few studies have examined the views of very early career trainees. The goal of 
this study was to assess premedical and medical student plans for family 
building, knowledge of fertility, and thoughts on assisted reproductive 
technology, as well as institutional support for parenthood in medical school 
and fertility curriculum. Methods Web-based cross-sectional survey on Qualtrics 
distributed through social media and school organization-based networks. 
Responses were reported as frequency and percent and compared across subgroups 
of population with χ2 tests. Results The study had a total of 605 premedical and 
medical students respondents. Most students (78%) do not have children but plan 
to have children in the future. Almost two-thirds (63%) of students would 
consider using assisted reproductive technology. More than 80% of respondents 
have considered or would consider oocyte cryopreservation for themselves or 
their partners. A majority (95%) of students are worried about balancing 
parenthood and a career in medicine and about their fertility declining while 
they complete medical training (84%). The most frequently cited barriers to 
family planning during medical school and residency were: limited time off 
during training (84%), demands of training (82%), cost of having a child (59%), 
and stigma of having a child during training (45%). Less than half of medical 
students had formal education on infertility. Conclusions Premedical and medical

76019, United States.","Caspases are evolutionarily conserved cysteinyl proteases that are integral in 
cell development and apoptosis. All apoptotic caspases evolved from a common 
ancestor into two distinct subfamilies with either monomeric (initiators) or 
dimeric (effectors) oligomeric states. The regulation of apoptosis is influenced 
by the activation mechanism of the two subfamilies, but the evolution of the 
well-conserved caspase-hemoglobinase fold into the two subfamilies is not well 
understood. We examined the folding landscape of monomeric caspases from two 
coral species over a broad pH range of 3-10.5. On an evolutionary timescale, the 
two coral caspases diverged from each other approximately 300 million years ago, 
and they diverged from human caspases about 600 million years ago. Our results 
indicate that both proteins have overall high stability, ∼15 kcal mol-1, near 
the physiological pH range (pH 6-8) and unfold via two partially folded 
intermediates, I1 and I2*, that are in equilibrium with the native and the 
unfolded state. Like the dimeric caspases, the monomeric coral caspases undergo 
a pH-dependent conformational change resulting from the titration of an 
evolutionarily conserved site. Data from molecular dynamics simulations paired 
with limited proteolysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry show that the small 
subunit of the monomeric caspases is unstable and unfolds prior to the large 
subunit. Overall, the data suggest that all caspases share a conserved folding 
landscape, that a conserved allosteric site can be fine-tuned for 
species-specific regulation, and that the subfamily of stable dimers may have 
evolved to stabilize the small subunit.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.3c00004

in children with vision impairment because it contains no visual test stimuli. 
It is not known whether in the primary school years children with vision

METHOD: We compared semantic fluency performance of two groups of 5- to 
11-year-old British English speaking children-one group with vision impairment 
and one without. We also investigated within-group differences in performance, 
based on severity of vision impairment. We administered one category (animals) 
to children with vision impairment (n = 45) and sighted children (n = 30). 
Participants had one minute to respond. Responses were coded for accuracy, error 
type, clusters, and switches.
RESULT: Correct responses increased with age within each group. Groups did not 
differ significantly on any outcome measure. Severity of vision impairment did 
not impact task performance.
CONCLUSION: Results suggested that semantic fluency performance-at least for the 
category animals-is not different in children with vision impairment compared to 
sighted children. Findings also suggest that semantic fluency could be a 
suitable addition to the tools that speech-language pathologists use to assess 
language abilities in children with vision impairment.","DOI: 10.1080/17549507.2023.2214711

used in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of abiraterone alone 
(without ADT) may have comparable efficacy to abiraterone with ongoing ADT. 
Here, we sought to assess the impact of ADT cessation in patients beginning 
abiraterone for castration-resistant prostate cancer.
METHODS: We identified 39 patients at our institution who received abiraterone 
alone (with discontinuation of ADT) between 2011 and 2022. We then procured a 
comparable group of 39 patients (matched by age, Gleason score, and 
prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level) who received abiraterone with ongoing ADT 
during the same period. We assessed and compared clinical outcomes in the two 
groups (abiraterone-alone vs. abiraterone-ADT) with respect to PSA response 
rates, PSA progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results were 
adjusted using Cox proportional-hazards multivariable models.
RESULTS: The median PSA before treatment initiation was 12.7 (range: 0.2-199) 
ng/mL in the abiraterone-alone group and 15.5 (range: 0.6-212) ng/mL in the 
abiraterone-ADT group. Use of abiraterone alone adequately suppressed 
testosterone levels in 35/37 (94.6%) patients. Patients receiving abiraterone 
alone had a median PSA reduction of 80.2% versus 79.5% in patients receiving 
abiraterone plus ADT. The median PSA progression-free survival in patients 
receiving abiraterone alone was 27.4 versus 25.8 months in patients receiving 
abiraterone plus ADT (hazard ratio [HR] 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.65-1.71; p = 0.82). In addition, abiraterone alone was associated with an 
overall survival of 3.6 versus 3.1 years in patients receiving abiraterone plus 
ADT (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.50-1.62; p = 0.72). There were no differences in PFS or 
OS between groups after performing Cox multivariable regression analyses.
CONCLUSION: Use of abiraterone alone was associated with comparable clinical 
outcomes to patients who received abiraterone together with ADT. Further 
prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the impact of abiraterone alone on

(CVDs). Hawthorn has a wide range of biological functions. Evidence suggests 
that the active components of HE reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, 
regulate lipid levels to prevent lipid accumulation, and inhibit free 
cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and foam cell formation. Additionally, 
hawthorn extract (HE) can protect vascular endothelial function, regulate 
endothelial dysfunction, and promote vascular endothelial relaxation. It has

age-related endothelial dysfunction, increase cellular calcium levels, cause 
antiplatelet aggregation, and promote antithrombosis. In clinical trials, HE has

pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, and exercise 
tolerance. Previous studies have pointed to the benefits of hawthorn and its

cognitive decline. However, our knowledge on causality and neurobiological 
underpinnings is still limited.
METHODS: In this preregistered analysis, we tested the impact of social 
isolation on central features of brain and cognitive ageing using a longitudinal 
population-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. We assayed 1992 
cognitively healthy participants (50-82years old, 921women) at baseline and 1409 
participants after~6y follow-up.
RESULTS: We found baseline social isolation and change in social isolation to be 
associated with smaller volumes of the hippocampus and clusters of reduced 
cortical thickness. Furthermore, poorer cognitive functions (memory, processing 
speed, executive functions) were linked to greater social isolation, too.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining advanced neuroimaging outcomes with prevalent lifestyle 
characteristics from a well-characterized population of middle- to older aged 
adults, we provide evidence that social isolation contributes to human brain 
atrophy and cognitive decline. Within-subject effects of social isolation were 
similar to between-subject effects, indicating an opportunity to reduce dementia 
risk by promoting social networks.

deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hydrogels (particularly DNA nanogels) have attracted 
massive attention in the last five years. The main contributor to this is the

eliminate long-standing structural inequities within the field and help reduce 
global health disparities. Ethics has a key role to play in fostering such a 
transformation: it can help identify what the transformation should entail. Yet, 
ethics scholarship linking global health research to greater equity and social 
justice has limited authority and capacity to do so for two related reasons: it 
largely fails to apply theories and concepts of justice from the global South 
and it says little about whether or how to address the coloniality and epistemic 
injustices inherent within global health research. This paper develops a 
multidimensional social justice lens using social justice and decolonial theory 
from the global North and global South. This lens identifies five core 
dimensions of social justice: power, recognition, harmony, inclusion, and 
well-being. This paper then applies the multidimensional lens to the global 
health research context. For each dimension of social justice, several key ways 
to transform global health research are identified and described. They include 
shifting control of global health research funding, education, conduct, and 
publishing away from the global North and making knowledge from the global South 
visible and valued. To conclude, potential objections are considered.",© 2023 The Authors. Bioethics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/bioe.13186

(2)Professor and Consultant Urological Surgeon, University Hospital Southampton 
NHS Trust, Southampton, UK.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women are 
prevalent and difficult to manage. The rise of antimicrobial resistance makes it 
prudent to re-investigate the role of nonantimicrobial agents in the prevention 
of RUTIs. We wanted to evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that 
employed methenamine hippurate as a therapy or prophylactic in adult women with 
rUTIs.
RECENT FINDINGS: Relevant databases were searched for RCTs using Cochrane 
methodology and reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) checklist, comparing the efficacy of methenamine hippurate to either an 
antibiotic or a placebo for the prophylaxis of rUTI in women.Six trials 
involving 322 patients taking methenamine and 419 patients receiving antibiotics 
in total were evaluated. The duration of the trials ranged from 12-24 months. 
Studies reported that methenamine was effective in extending the mean period 
between symptomatic episodes of urinary tract infections (UTIs), keeping the 
patient symptom- and infection-free, and reducing the number of UTI episodes. 
The newer studies reported that methenamine reduced the incidence rates of 
recurrent UTIs and was not inferior to the antibiotic in this regard.
SUMMARY: The outcomes of methenamine hippurate were found to be at par with the 
antibiotic prophylaxis. It might serve as a suitable alternative nonantibiotic 
prophylaxis for females with rUTIs.","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1097/MOU.0000000000001108

pathogenesis of malaria. In this systematic review, different ascorbic acid 
levels in malaria patients with different severity levels of malaria and 
Plasmodium species were synthesized.
METHODS: The systematic review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database 
(CRD42023394849). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Ovid, Scopus, 
and Google Scholar were conducted to identify studies that reported ascorbic 
acid and malaria. The pooled standardized mean difference (Cohen's d) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 1480 articles were obtained from the searches of the 
databases, and 30 studies were included for syntheses. The meta-analysis 
revealed that patients with malaria had lower levels of ascorbic acid than those 
without malaria or un-infected controls (P < 0.01, Cohen's d: -3.71, 95% CI: 
-4.44-(-2.98), I2: 98.87%, 30 studies). Comparable levels of ascorbic acid were 
observed between patients with severe malaria and those with non-severe malaria 
(P = 0.06, Cohen's d: -1.39, 95% CI: -2.85-0.07, I2: 96.58%, 4 studies). 
Similarly, levels of ascorbic acid were comparable between patients with P. 
falciparum and P. vivax malaria (P = 0.34, Cohen's d: -1.06, 95% CI: -3.23-1.12, 
I2: 97.30%, 3 studies).
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis reveals diminished levels of ascorbic acid in 
malaria cases. Manipulating the host's nutritional status, such as by 
supplementing it with ascorbic acid to restore ROS balance, may alter the 
progression of malarial infection and prevention of disease severity.","DOI: 10.1089/ars.2023.0306

supportive environment for multi-team learning. In this project, we aimed to 
describe the processes and outcomes of a virtual deprescribing collaborative 
that facilitated implementation of deprescribing interventions around the 
country.
METHODS: Two successive cohorts comprised of multidisciplinary teams from 
geographically diverse veterans affairs (VA) sites were selected via an 
application process to participate in a virtual deprescribing collaborative. 
Each site developed its own deprescribing protocol and took part in regular 
meetings, mentoring groups, monthly data reporting, and other learning 
activities over an approximate 9 month period, per cohort. Standard measures 
were number of veterans served and medications deprescribed. Descriptive and 
qualitative analyses were utilized.
RESULTS: Twenty-one total VA sites were selected to participate in the 
deprescribing collaborative in two cohorts (Cohort 1, n = 12 sites; Cohort 2, 
n = 9 sites). The majority of sites' practice areas directly served the older 
adult population, and the majority of site leads were pharmacists. The most 
utilized tool used by the collaborative sites was the VA VIONE decision support 
tool (n = 14) and the most common strategy was individualized medication review. 
Combining outcomes from both Cohorts 1 and 2, a total of n = 4770 veterans were 
served, with 8332 medications deprescribed. Eighty-two percent of Cohort 1 sites 
surveyed reported their deprescribing program was still being utilized after 
1 year follow up.
CONCLUSIONS: This virtual deprescribing collaborative aided in the successful 
implementation of both established and novel deprescribing practices across a 
variety of VA practice sites that care for older adults. The shared learning 
experience enhanced problem solving and allowed for interdisciplinary teamwork. 
Overall the collaborative was successful in improving polypharmacy for several 
thousand older adults.","Published 2023. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public

Medicine, Diakoneo Diak Klinikum Schwäbisch-Hall, Schwäbisch-Hall, Germany (TW).","BACKGROUND: Peripheral regional anaesthesia is frequently used for upper 
extremity surgery. To prolong the duration of analgesia, adjuvants can be added 
to single-injection local anaesthetics. Despite attempts to compare several 
adjuvants in pairwise meta-analyses, a comprehensive comparison is still 
missing.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this network meta-analysis was to determine the 
effectiveness of adjuvants in upper extremity peripheral nerve blocks.
DESIGN: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials with network 
meta-analyses.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search in Embase, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Web of Science 
was performed up to March 2023.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing different adjuvants injected 
perineurally in peripheral upper extremity nerve blocks were eligible. 
Frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model 
with physiological saline as the comparator. The primary endpoint was the ratio 
of means (ROM) of the duration of analgesia.
RESULTS: The review included 242 randomised controlled trials with a total of 
17 391 patients. Twenty-eight adjuvants were compared in the largest networks. 
Most network estimations consisted of a high proportion of direct evidence. 
Fourteen adjuvants increased the duration of analgesia significantly by the 
following factors, ROM [95% confidence interval (CI)]: dexamethasone 1.95 (1.79 
to 2.13), buprenorphine 1.83 (1.51 to 2.24), butorphanol 1.84 (1.41 to 2.39), 
potassium chloride 1.89 (1.15 to 3.11), dexmedetomidine 1.70 (1.59 to 1.81), 
sufentanil 1.70 (1.27 to 2.29), ketorolac 1.68 (1.24 to 2.27), midazolam 1.55 
(1.24 to 1.94), tramadol 1.52 (1.32 to 1.75), nalbuphine 1.50 (1.30 to 1.72), 
morphine 1.43 (1.09 to 1.88), magnesium sulfate 1.42 (1.20 to 1.67), clonidine 
1.36 (1.24 to 1.50) and fentanyl 1.23 (1.08 to 1.40).Inconsistency in network 
meta-analysis was substantial. Overall side effect rates were low with all 
adjuvants.
CONCLUSION: The best interventions to prolong the duration of analgesia were 
dexamethasone, followed by dexmedetomidine, opioids, electrolytes, ketorolac and 
midazolam. There are general concerns about the quality of underlying studies 
and the risk of publication bias.

population with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on metformin treatment for more than three 
years and to identify its risk factors. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study 
conducted on 257 patients with T2D treated with metformin for at least three 
years. Patients were divided into two groups according to their vitamin B12 
status. Low vitamin B12 was defined as ≤ 203 pg/mL. Results: The mean age of the 
patients was 59.8  ±  7.9 years. The mean duration of metformin use was 
10.2  ±  5.2 years. The mean vitamin B12 level was 294.9  ±  156.4 pg/mL. The 
prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was 28.4%. Male gender, HbA1c < 7% and 
hyperhomocysteinemia were significantly associated with vitamin B12 deficiency 
(respectively p  =  0.02, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Homocysteine level was 
negatively correlated with vitamin B12 level (r  =  -0.2, p  =  0.001). Dose and 
duration of metformin treatment, peripheral neuropathy and anemia were not 
associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. On multivariate analysis, HbA1c < 7% and 
hyperhomocysteinemia were independently associated with vitamin B12 deficiency 
(respectively OR = 3.2, 95%CI  =  [1.6-6.3] and OR = 2.3, 95%CI  =  [1.2-4.2]). 
Discussion: The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with T2D on 
metformin treatment was high. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with vitamin 
B12 deficiency suggesting that the deficit occurs at the tissue level.","DOI: 10.1177/17423953231184220

equivalent dose limit for the lens from 150 to 20 mSv/year, due to its 
association with cataracts at low radiation doses. Our aim was to estimate the 
radiation doses received by the lens during endourological procedures that may 
require fluoroscopy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multicenter study including prospective data of annual 
eye dosimeters between 2017-2020. Four endourologists used an eye dosimeter in 
endourological procedures that may require fluoroscopy (URS, RIRS and PCNL). 
Surgeon 1 and 2 wore leaded glasses; Surgeon 1 also used the ALARA protocol. 
Descriptive statistical analysis using SPSS 25.0 was conducted.
RESULTS: Surgeons 1, 2, 3 and 4 performed a median of 159, 586, 102 and 129 
endourological procedures/year, respectively, for a total of 641, 2,340, 413 and 
350 procedures between 2017 and 2020. The median annual dose of lens radiation 
exposure was 0.16, 1.18, 3.79 and 1.42 mSv per year, respectively, which 
corresponds to 0.001, 0.009, 0.024 and 0.012 mSv/procedure. The two surgeons who 
used leaded glasses registered a lower radiation dose/procedure (0.001 vs. 
0.027). Similarly, the urologist who used the ALARA protocol registered the 
lowest lens radiation dose compared to the three surgeons who did not use it 
(0.001 vs. 0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: The endourologists who participated in this study successfully 
comply with current guidelines on radiation exposure to the lens. Registered eye 
lens radiation does not seem to be related to the number of procedures but 
rather the use of leaded glasses and the ALARA protocol.  .","DOI: 10.1089/end.2023.0061

electroacupuncture (EA) in the regulation of chemokines in endogenous stem cell 
mobilization and myocardial regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI).
METHODS: An MI model was constructed in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by 
ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. After 4 weeks of 
treatment, echocardiography was used to detect changes in cardiac function, and 
Masson's trichrome staining was used to detect collagen deposition. In addition, 
immunofluorescence staining was applied to examine von Willebrand factor 
(vWF)-positive vessels, the expression of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and 
proliferation marker Ki67, and the number of c-kit-positive, C-X-C chemokine 
receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-positive, and Sca-1-positive endogenous stem cells in 
the infarcted area. In addition, the expression of stromal cell-derived factor 
(SDF)-1 and stem cell factor (SCF) was detected.
RESULTS: EA increased the ejection fraction after MI, reduced collagen 
deposition and cellular apoptosis, and increased the number of blood vessels 
compared with an untreated model group. EA significantly promoted cellular 
proliferation, except for myocardial cells, and significantly increased the 
number of c-kit-, CXCR4- and Sca-1-positive stem cells. Moreover, the expression 
of SDF-1 and SCF in myocardial tissue in the EA group was significantly higher 
than that in the (untreated) MI group.
CONCLUSIONS: EA appears to promote angiogenesis and reduce collagen deposition, 
thus improving the cardiac function of rats with MI. The underlying mechanism of 
action may involve endogenous stem cell mobilization mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4 and 
SCF/c-kit.","DOI: 10.1177/09645284231169485

low-structural and cognitive (Class 3). Classes 1 and 2 showed lower depression 
at baseline; however, the trajectory change rate was opposite than Class 3.

are redox-active. Because of the high concentration of the ions, RAILs exhibit 
not only ion conduction but also electron conduction through the bimolecular 
electron self-exchange reaction. Because neat RAILs do not contain any 
supporting electrolyte, migration of the redox active ions results in 
enhancement or diminishment of the redox current at an electrode. To treat the 
migration effect for electrochemical analysis, a limiting current correction was 
theoretically derived by Oldham, Hyk, and Stojek (Oldham, K. J. Electroanal. 
Chem. 1992, 337, 91-126; Hyk, W.; Stojek, Z. Anal. Chem. 2002, 747, 4805-4813) 
for the steady-state voltammetry. Although steady-state voltammetry is a robust 
method in electrochemistry, the actual measurement is time-consuming and cannot 
be always made because of the instability of the electrochemical system. To 
overcome the problem, we propose the use of cyclic voltammetry to evaluate the 
diffusion coefficient of the redox-active ion that constitutes RAIL. The peak 
currents were analyzed by the purely diffusional framework of the 
Aoki-Matsuda-Osteryoung equation (Aoki, K.; Akimoto, K.; Tokuda, K.; Matsuda, 
H.; Osteryoung, J. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1984, 171, 219-230.) in the range from 
several mV s-1 to several ten mV s-1, and the migration correction to the 
near-steady-state limiting current was applied on the basis of the 
Oldham-Hyk-Stojek theory to scale the diffusion coefficient. As an example of 
RAILs, [FcC6ImC1][TFSI], which exhibits charge increase reaction with the same 
sign (S+ - e- ⇌ P2+), was used and the cyclic voltammograms were recorded at 
various sizes of the microdisk electrodes and various scan rates. The peak 
currents obeyed the Aoki-Matsuda-Osteryoung equation with the scaled diffusion 
coefficient, which has the same value as determined by the steady-state 
voltammogram. Our approach can be used to evaluate the diffusion coefficient of 
redox-active ions that constitute the RAIL with the charge increase reaction 
with the same sign.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00635

classifier, can provide extra information for the diagnosis and prognosis of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: We systematically analyzed the peripheral blood of preoperative HCC 
patients (n = 270) for CTC number, Ki67 index reflecting the proliferative CTC 
percentage (PCP), and CTC clusters correlated with the characteristics of 
malignant HCC tumors.
RESULTS: Driver gene mutations were found with high levels of consistency 
between CTCs and primary tumors (n = 73). CTC number and PCP were associated 
with tumor size, microvascular invasion (MVI), presence or absence of multiple 
tumors, and thrombosis significantly. CTC number and PCP robustly separated 
patients with and without relapse, with a sensitivity of 88.89%/81.48% and a 
specificity of 72.73%/94.81% in the training set (n = 104) and corresponding 
values of 80.00%/86.67% and 78.38%/89.19% in the validation set (n = 52), 
showing a better performance than that associated with the alpha-fetoprotein 
(AFP) level. CTC number, PCP, CTC clusters, and MVI were independent significant 
risk factors for HCC recurrence (P = 0.0375, P < 0.0001, P = 0.0017, and 
P = 0.0157). A nomogram model based on these risk factors showed a considerable

often fails to enter the common hepatic artery.
PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the impact of aortoceliac angle on the 
implantation of a port-catheter system via a femoral approach for hepatic 
arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 399 patients with advanced HCC underwent 
percutaneous implantation of a port-catheter system for HAIC. Among these 
patients, 383 underwent successful implantation via a femoral artery approach 
(success group). In 16 patients, port-catheter systems were implanted via a 
subclavian artery approach (failure group) after failure of the initial attempt 
via the femoral artery due to failed catheter tip fixation to the gastroduodenal 
artery. We statistically analyzed aortoceliac angle, ostial celiac stenosis, 
sex, age, weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) between groups.
RESULTS: The average aortoceliac angle, weight, and BMI were significantly 
different between the two groups (P < 0.001, P = 0.02, P < 0.001, respectively). 
Among them, only the aortoceliac angle was a significant risk factor in logistic 
regression analysis. The smaller the aortoceliac angle, the more often the 
femoral approach failed (P < 0.001, odds ratio = 0.817, 95% confidence interval 
= 0.752-0.887). There were no significant differences in ostial celiac stenosis,

CONCLUSION: For patients with an acute aortoceliac angle, the femoral approach 
is likely to fail. A subclavian artery approach should be preferentially 
considered for percutaneous implantation of a port-catheter system in such 
patients.","DOI: 10.1177/02841851231181321

AIM: To investigate the performance of a novel PPGPW-based parameter, falling 
scaled slope (FSS), in distinguishing PE. To investigate the advantages of the

analysis.
METHODS: Eighty-one pieces of PPGPW data were acquired for the study (PE, 
n = 44; normotensive, n = 37). The FSS values were calculated and used to 
construct a PE classifier using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. A

comparison was conducted with previously published PPGPW-based models.
RESULT: Compared to the previous PPGPW-based parameters, FSS showed a better 
performance in distinguishing PE with an AUC value of 0.924, the best threshold 
of 0.498 could predict PE with a sensitivity of 84.1% and a specificity of

identify, categorize, and summarize the existing knowledge about the experiences 
of older persons and their caregivers during conflict situations; (2) identify 
the support needs of older persons and their caregivers, and; (3) identify gaps 
in the literature and understanding that may inform future research.
METHODS: A scoping review methodology of academic peer-reviewed and gray English 
language literature was employed using six academic literature databases and one 
gray literature database. We further performed comprehensive searches of 
relevant search engines and organization websites and bibliographic hand 
searches to identify additional academic and gray literature. Two authors 
screened for eligibility of identified studies and documents. One reviewer 
extracted data regarding authors, article type, geographic origin, key 
participant characteristics, aims, study design and data collection method, 
results, conclusions and limitations. Data were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: 83 documents met this review's inclusion criteria, including 21 
academic documents and 62 from the gray literature. Thematic analysis revealed 
that conflict situations exacerbate existing inequalities experienced by older 
persons. Within this overarching theme were three interconnected sub-themes: (1) 
Older adults are particularly vulnerable during conflict situations; (2) Older 
persons are inadequately supported in conflict situations; (3) In the face of 
great challenges, many older adults still manage to endure through conflict 
situations. We identified 15 recommendations from the reviewed documents to 
better support older adults in conflict situations.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing inequalities, such as ageism and ableism, targeted 
discrimination, and poor health outcomes, become exacerbated during conflict 
situations, resulting in older persons being less able to flee and meet their 
daily needs with sufficient access to necessities and healthcare. Little is 
known of the experiences and needs of family caregivers during conflict 
situations. We identified several opportunities to improve the experience and 
support of older persons in conflict situations.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published by

an individual's risk of developing a complex trait such as obesity, their 
application in the clinic has, to date, been limited by a lack of data from 
non-European populations. As a collaboration model of the International Hundred 
K+ Cohorts Consortium (IHCC), we endeavored to develop a globally applicable 
trans-ethnic PRS for body mass index (BMI) through this relatively new 
international effort.
METHODS: The polygenic risk score (PRS) model was developed, trained and tested 
at the Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) of The Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia (CHOP) based on a BMI meta-analysis from the GIANT consortium. The 
validated PRS models were subsequently disseminated to the participating sites. 
Scores were generated by each site locally on their cohorts and summary 
statistics returned to CAG for final analysis.
RESULTS: We show that in the absence of a well powered trans-ethnic GWAS from 
which to derive marker SNPs and effect estimates for PRS, trans-ethnic scores 
can be generated from European ancestry GWAS using Bayesian approaches such as 
LDpred, by adjusting the summary statistics using trans-ethnic linkage 
disequilibrium reference panels. The ported trans-ethnic scores outperform 
population specific-PRS across all non-European ancestry populations 
investigated including East Asians and three-way admixed Brazilian cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we show that for a truly polygenic trait such as BMI adjusting 
the summary statistics of a well powered European ancestry study using 
trans-ethnic LD reference results in a score that is predictive across a range 
of ancestries including East Asians and three-way admixed Brazilians.","© 2023 The Authors. Clinical and Translational Medicine published by John Wiley

histological material. Minimally invasive effusion cytology specimens are an 
alternative that, like biopsies, require ancillary analyses. Validation of 
immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses on cytology, including the surrogate markers 
for molecular alterations BAP1 and MTAP, is of interest.
METHODS: IHC for eight different markers was performed on 59 paired 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pleural biopsies and pleural effusion cell 
blocks with mesothelioma. Immunoreactivity in ≥10% of tumour cells was 
considered positive/preserved. The concordance between histological and 
cytological materials was assessed.
RESULTS: The overall percentage of agreement between the histological 
epithelioid component in 58 biopsies and paired cell blocks was 93% for 
calretinin, 98% for CK5, 97% for podoplanin, 90% for WT1, 86% for EMA, 100% for 
desmin, 91% for BAP1, and 72% for MTAP. For 11 cases with biphasic or 
sarcomatoid histology, the concordance between cytology and the histological 
sarcomatoid component was low for calretinin, CK5, and WT1 (all ≤45%). For the 
whole cohort, loss of both BAP1 and MTAP was seen in 40% while both markers were 
preserved in 11% of the biopsies for epithelioid histology. The corresponding 
numbers were 54% and 8%, respectively, for the paired cell blocks.
CONCLUSIONS: Generally, a high concordance for IHC staining was seen between 
paired biopsies and pleural effusion cell blocks from mesotheliomas, but the 
somewhat lower agreement for WT1, EMA, and especially MTAP calls for further 
investigation and local quality assurance. The lower concordance for the 
sarcomatoid subtype for some markers may indicate biological differences.",© 2023 The Authors. Cytopathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/cyt.13265

on QTc interval and delay in cardiac repolarization at clinically relevant 
exposures. This was a single-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study of 
ascending doses of abemaciclib. Thirty-five healthy participants were 
administered a single dose of 200 to 600 mg abemaciclib. Twelve-lead 
electrocardiogram tracings and pharmacokinetic samples were collected serially 
pre- and post-dose. The primary objective was to study the relationship between 
abemaciclib and its active metabolites (M2 and M20) and QTc interval following 
ascending oral doses of abemaciclib. The secondary objective included evaluating 
the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of abemaciclib in healthy 
participants. Exposure-response analysis demonstrated that there was no 
significant relationship between placebo-corrected change from baseline QTcF

400 mg, were well-tolerated by healthy participants; however, at the 600 mg dose 
(3-times highest registered dose), the frequency and severity of 
treatment-related gastrointestinal events (primarily diarrhea, nausea, and 
vomiting) increased. In conclusion, single doses of abemaciclib, up to 400 mg,

molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this study, we find that 
miR-133a is involved in obesity-induced follicular development disorder. After 
feeding with a high-fat diet (HFD) and fructose water for nine weeks, the mouse 
body weight is significantly increased, accompanied by an inflammatory state and 
increased expression of miR-133a in the adipose tissues and ovaries as well as 
accelerated follicle depletion. Although miR-133a is increased in the fat and 
ovaries of HFD mice, the increased miR-133a in the HFD ovaries is not derived 
from exosome transferred from obese adipose tissues but is synthesized by 
ovarian follicular cells in response to HFD-induced inflammation. In vivo 
experiments show that intrabursal injection of miR-133a agomir induces a 
decrease in primordial follicles and an increase in antral follicles and atretic 
follicles, which is similar to HFD-induced abnormal folliculogenesis. 
Overexpression of miR-133a modestly promotes granulosa cell apoptosis by 
balancing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as C1QL1 and XIAP and 
pro-apoptotic proteins such as PTEN. Overall, this study reveals the function of 
miR-133a in obesity-induced ovarian folliculogenesis dysfunction and sheds light

a lack of treatment methods, this study is performed to investigate the function 
of PITX2 in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) in the progression of pancreatic 
cancer. Scientific hypotheses are proposed according to bioinformatics analysis 
and tissue microarray analysis. Stable knockdown of PITX2 in PSCs is achieved 
through lentiviral infection. The relative expressions of PITX2, α-SMA, 
vimentin, CTNNB1, AXIN1 and LEF1 are measured in wild-type PSCs and 
PITX2-knockdown PSCs. Proliferative capacity is measured by EdU assay. After 
coculture with PSCs, the proliferation, invasion and migration capacity of 
pancreatic cancer cells are tested. EMT and Wnt/β-catenin downstream genes of 
pancreatic cancer cells are investigated to reveal the potential mechanism. 
Bioinformatics analysis reveals that the PITX2 gene is highly expressed in 
stromal cells in pancreatic cancer and is correlated with squamous-type PDAC. 
Analysis of PDAC tissue microarray further demonstrates that high PITX2 level in 
stromal cells is correlated with poor prognosis in PDAC. After stable knockdown 
of PITX2 in PSCs, the relative protein levels of α-SMA, vimentin, CTNNB1, AXIN1 
and LEF1 are decreased, and the proliferative capacity of PSCs is also 
decreased. After coculture with PSCs, in which PITX2 expression is 
downregulated, the proliferation, invasion and migration capacities of 
pancreatic cancer cells are inhibited. Thus, our results show that 
PITX2-silenced PSCs inhibit the growth, migration and invasion of pancreatic 
cancer cells via reduced EMT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.","DOI: 10.3724/abbs.2023118

advanced gastric cancer patients, and chemotherapy resistance is one of the main 
reasons for treatment failure. Thus, it is important to reveal the mechanism of 
oxaliplatin resistance and to seek effective intervention strategies to improve 
chemotherapy sensitivity, thereby improving the survival and prognosis of 
gastric cancer patients. To understand the molecular mechanisms of oxaliplatin 
resistance, we generate an oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell line and 
conduct assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) for both parental and oxaliplatin-resistant AGS cells. A 
total of 3232 genomic regions are identified to have higher accessibility in 
oxaliplatin-resistant cells, and DNA-binding motif analysis identifies JUNB as 
the core transcription factor in the regulatory network. JUNB is overexpressed 
in oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells, and its upregulation is 
associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients, which is validated by 
our tissue microarray data. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing 
(ChIP-seq) analysis reveals that JUNB binds to the transcriptional start site of 
key genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. Knockdown of JUNB inhibits the 
MAPK signaling pathway and restores sensitivity to oxaliplatin. Combined 
treatment with the ERK inhibitor piperlongumine or MEK inhibitor trametinib 
effectively overcomes oxaliplatin resistance. This study provides evidence that 
JUNB mediates oxaliplatin resistance in gastric cancer by activating the MAPK 
pathway. The combination of MAPK inhibitors with oxaliplatin overcomes 
resistance to oxaliplatin, providing a promising treatment opportunity for 
oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer patients.","DOI: 10.3724/abbs.2023119

p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, but how its mutation or 
depletion leads to tumorigenesis still remains poorly understood. Recently, 
there has been increasing evidence that p53 plays a vital role in regulating 
cellular metabolism as well as in metabolic adaptation to nutrient starvation.

have completely different functions compared to wild-type p53. In this review, 
we briefly summarize what is known about p53 mediating anabolic and catabolic

evaluated by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography 
(HR-pQCT) could classify more patients with erosive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
compared with conventional radiography (CR) of the hands, wrists, and feet. 
Furthermore, we characterize and quantify bone erosions in the two MTP joints by 
HR-pQCT.
METHODS: This single-center cross-sectional study included patients with 
established RA (disease duration ≥5 years). Blinded to patient data, the number 
and volume of erosions in the 4th and 5th MTP joints were measured by HR-pQCT, 
whereas the erosive scores by CR of 44 joints in the hands, wrists, and feet 
were assessed according to the Sharp/van der Heijde method.
RESULTS: Among 42 participants, 30 patients were classified with erosive RA and 
12 with non-erosive RA by CR. HR-pQCT of two MTP joints could classify more 
patients with erosive RA compared with CR of 44 joints (p = .03). The optimal 
cut-off value for the number and volume of erosions per patient in the 4th and 
5th MTP joints by HR-pQCT was 7.5 erosions and 11.7 mm3 , respectively, for 
detecting erosive disease by CR. Erosions in the two MTP joints by HR-pQCT were 
found most frequently and were largest at the lateral quadrant of the 5th 
metatarsal head.
CONCLUSION: The superiority of HR-pQCT of the 4th and 5th MTP joints compared 
with CR of 44 joints for classifying erosive RA provides a basis for larger 
studies evaluating if HR-pQCT could be used for diagnosing erosive RA in the

going through bedrock with significantly elevated levels of uranium (238U) and 
especially thorium (232Th), and significant levels of their progeny 222Rn and 
220Rn. There are also significantly elevated levels of gamma radiation in these

responses to such a dietary app and suggestions for improvement and further 
development of a prototype.
DESIGN: A prototype of the dietary app has been developed and demonstrates how 
all information it provides can be tailored to the individual patient according 
to stage of disease, anthropometrics, and phosphate and potassium levels. A 
qualitative evaluation of the prototype was conducted using the Consolidated

composed of a perylene diimide (PDI) chromophore and a stable

times of the molecular quartet states generated upon photoexcitation and 
illustrate that (i) a coherent manipulation of the spin state is possible in 
these systems even at room temperature and that (ii) a spin coherence time of 
0.7 μs can be achieved under these conditions. This demonstration of electron 
spin coherence at ambient temperatures paves the way for practical applications 
of such systems in functional molecular devices.","DOI: 10.1021/jacs.3c04021

demand for telenursing and the chronic illness resources available to patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as well as the factors that affect this 
requirement.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHODS: This study included 586 participants with T2DM. A telenursing needs 
questionnaire developed by the research team was used to assess the telenursing 
needs of patients with T2DM, and the Chinese version of the Chronic Illness 
Resources Survey was used to assess the participants' community chronic disease 
resources. A one-way ANOVA and multiple regression analysis were used to 
determine the factors influencing the demand for telenursing and to estimate the 
relationship between chronic illness resources and the need for telenursing. The 
STROBE checklist was followed.
RESULTS: The patients' telenursing needs, ranked from high to low, are as 
follows: individualized skills and safety; basic disease care; psychological and 
spiritual needs; respect and social support; and high-level health management. 
The chronic disease resource score was 3.47 ± .02, which suggested that patients 
with T2DM have relatively rich disease resources. Multiple regression analyses 
showed that resources for chronic diseases, the course of diabetes and 
complications, family income and other chronic diseases accounted for 79.6% of 
the variance in T2DM patients' telenursing needs.
CONCLUSIONS: The telenursing needs of patients with T2DM are prominent, and 
primarily focus on basic nursing needs for the disease. To some extent, chronic 
disease resources affect the telenursing needs of patients with T2DM.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is crucial to pay attention to research on 
telenursing for T2DM patients from the patients' perspective. Enhancing 
resources for chronic diseases may help meet the telenursing needs of T2DM 
patients.

tomography (CT) dose optimization; however, body weight cannot always be 
measured prior to CT examination, especially in the emergency setting. The aim 
of this study was to investigate whether deep learning-based body weight from 
chest CT scout images can be an alternative to actual body weight in CT 
radiation dose management.
METHODS: Chest CT scout images and diagnostic images acquired for medical 
checkups were collected from 3601 patients. A deep learning model was developed 
to predict body weight from scout images. The correlation between actual and 
predicted body weight was analyzed. To validate the use of predicted body weight 
in radiation dose management, the volume CT dose index (CTDIvol ) and the 
dose-length product (DLP) were compared between the body weight subgroups based 
on actual and predicted body weight. Surrogate size-specific dose estimates 
(SSDEs) acquired from actual and predicted body weight were compared to the 
reference standard.
RESULTS: The median actual and predicted body weight were 64.1 (interquartile 
range: 56.5-72.4) and 64.0 (56.3-72.2) kg, respectively. There was a strong 
correlation between actual and predicted body weight (ρ = 0.892, p < 0.001). The 
CTDIvol and DLP of the body weight subgroups were similar based on actual and 
predicted body weight (p < 0.001). Both surrogate SSDEs based on actual and 
predicted body weight were not significantly different from the reference 
standard (p = 0.447 and 0.410, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Predicted body weight can be an alternative to actual body weight in 
managing dose metrics and simplifying SSDE calculation. Our proposed method can 
be useful for CT radiation dose management in adult patients with unknown body 
weight.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics published by

health problems. For athletes with an impairment, sports-related health problems 
further burden an already restricted lifestyle, underlining the importance of 
prevention strategies in para-sports.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive overview with quality assessment of the 
literature on sports-related health problems, their etiology, and available 
preventive measures in para-sports following the steps of the Sequence of 
Prevention.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search (in PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and 
the Cochrane Library) was performed up to December 8, 2021, in collaboration 
with a medical information specialist.
STUDY SELECTION: The search yielded 3006 articles, of which 64 met all inclusion 
criteria.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with quality assessment.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent researchers carried out the screening process 
and quality assessment. One researcher extracted data, and the Sequence of 
Prevention categorized evidence.
RESULTS: A total of 64 studies were included, of which 61 reported on the 
magnitude and risk factors of sports-related health problems, while only 3 
reported on the effectiveness of preventive measures. Of these, 30 studies were 
of high quality. Most studies (84%) included elite-level athletes. The reported 
injury incidence varied widely between sports (0-91 per 1000 athlete days) and 
impairment categories (1-50 per 1000 athlete days). The same applies to illness 
incidence with regard to different sports (3-49 per 1000 athlete days) and 
impairment categories (6-14 per 1000 athlete days).
CONCLUSION: This review shows the current vast range of reported sport-related 
health problems in para-sports. There is limited evidence concerning the 
severity of these sports-related health problems and inconclusive evidence on 
the risk factors. Lastly, the evidence regarding the development and 
effectiveness of preventive measures for para-athletes is sparse.","DOI: 10.1177/19417381231178534

the restricted mean survival time (RMST) is a suitable substitute for the hazard 
ratio (HR). However, the RMST only measures the survival of patients over a 
period of time from the baseline and cannot reflect changes in life expectancy 
over time. Based on the RMST, we study the conditional restricted mean survival 
time (cRMST) by estimating life expectancy in the future according to the time 
that patients have survived, reflecting the dynamic survival status of patients 
during follow-up. In this paper, we introduce the estimation method of cRMST 
based on pseudo-observations, the statistical inference concerning the 
difference between two cRMSTs (cRMSTd), and the establishment of the robust 
dynamic prediction model using the landmark method. Simulation studies are 
conducted to evaluate the statistical properties of these methods. The results 
indicate that the estimation of the cRMST is accurate, and the dynamic RMST 
model has high accuracy in coefficient estimation and good predictive 
performance. In addition, an example of patients with chronic kidney disease who

to produce various industrial products with many advantages. However, using 
enzymes in organic solvents often suffers from inactivation or decreased 
catalytic activity and stability. An R-selective ω-amine transaminase from 
Aspergillus terreus (AtATA) exhibited activity toward 1-acetylnaphthalene. 
However, AtATA displayed unsatisfactory organic solvent resistance, which is 
required to enhance the solubility of the hydrophobic substrate 
1-acetylnaphthalene. So, improving the tolerance of enzymes in organic solvents 
is essential.
MAIN METHODS AND RESULTS: The method of regional random mutation combined with 
combinatorial mutation was used to improve the resistance of AtATA in organic 
solvents. Enzyme surface areas are structural elements that undergo reversible 
conformational transitions, thus affecting the stability of the enzyme in 
organic solvents. Herein, three surface areas containing three loops were 
selected as potential mutation regions. And the ""best"" mutant T23I/T200K/P260S 
(M3) was acquired. In different concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the 
catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km ) toward 1-acetylnaphthalene and the stability 
(half-life t1/2 ) were higher than the wild-type (WT) of AtATA. The results of 
decreased Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) values via 20-ns molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations under 15%, 25%, 35%, and 45% DMSO revealed that mutant 
M3 had lower flexibility, acquiring a more stable protein structure and 
contributing to its organic solvents stability than WT. Furthermore, M3 was 
applied to convert 1-acetylnaphthalene for synthesizing 
(R)-(+)-1(1-naphthyl)-ethylamine ((R)-NEA), which was an intermediate of 
Cinacalcet Hydrochloride for the treatment of secondary hyperthyroidism and 
hypercalcemia. Moreover, in a 20-mL scale-up experiment, 10 mM 
1-acetylnaphthalene can be converted to (R)-NEA with 85.2% yield and a strict 
R-stereoselectivity (enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value > 99.5%) within 10 h under 
25% DMSO.
CONCLUSION: The beneficial mutation sites were identified to tailor AtATA's 
organic solvents stability via regional random mutation. The ""best"" mutant 
T23I/T200K/P260S (M3) holds great potential application for the synthesis of 
(R)-NEA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1002/biot.202300120

dynamic assembly and disassembly of LLPS compartments using complex coacervates 
as models inside synthetic cells. Semipermeable GUVs constructed with defined 
lipid composition encapsulate the biomolecules, including enzymes required to 
regulate coacervates. Assembly and disassembly of coacervates are triggered in 
independent systems by the diffusion of substrates through the membrane into the 
vesicle lumen. The coupling of enzyme networks in a single synthetic cell system 
allows for reversible and out-of-equilibrium regulation of coacervates. The

responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We aimed to investigate whether a fourth 
mRNA COVID-19 vaccination improved antibody quantity and quality.
METHODS: In this cohort study, conducted at 5 sites in the Netherlands, we 
compared antibody concentrations 28 days after 4 mRNA vaccinations (3-dose 
primary series plus 1 booster vaccination) in SARS-CoV-2 naive, 
immunocompromised patients with haematological malignancies to those obtained by 
age-matched, healthy individuals who had received the standard primary 2-dose 
mRNA vaccination schedule followed by a first booster mRNA vaccination. Prior to 
and 4 weeks after each vaccination, peripheral blood samples and data on 
demographic parameters and medical history were collected. Concentrations of 
antibodies that bind spike 1 (S1) and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 
were quantified in binding antibody units (BAU) per mL according to the WHO 
International Standard for COVID-19 serological tests. Seroconversion was 
defined as an S1 IgG concentration >10 BAU/mL and a previous SARS-CoV-2 
infection as N IgG >14.3 BAU/mL. Antibody neutralising activity was tested using 
lentiviral-based pseudoviruses expressing spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type 
(D614G), Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.4/5 variants. This study is registered 
with EudraCT, number 2021-001072-41.
FINDINGS: Between March 24, 2021 and May 4, 2021, 723 patients with 
haematological diseases were enrolled, of which 414 fulfilled the inclusion 
criteria for the current analysis. Although S1 IgG concentrations in patients 
significantly improved after the fourth dose, they remained significantly lower 
compared to those obtained by 58 age-matched healthy individuals after their 
first booster (third) vaccination. The rise in neutralising antibody 
concentration was most prominent in patients with a recovering B cell 
compartment, although potent responses were also observed in patients with 
persistent immunodeficiencies. 19% of patients never seroconverted, despite 4 
vaccinations. Patients who received their first 2 vaccinations when they were B 
cell depleted and the third and fourth vaccination during B cell recovery 
demonstrated similar antibody induction dynamics as patients with normal B cell 
numbers during the first 2 vaccinations. However, the neutralising capacity of 
these antibodies was significantly better than that of patients with normal B 
cell numbers after two vaccinations.
INTERPRETATION: A fourth mRNA COVID-19 vaccination improved S1 IgG 
concentrations in the majority of patients with a haematological malignancy. 
Vaccination during B cell depletion may pave the way for better quality of 
antibody responses after B cell reconstitution.

Assessment in Prehospital Care and 2) Frailty Scores for Application in 
Prehospital Care. Paramedics recognised frailty assessment in pre-hospital care 
to be feasible and important. They highlighted the need for a simple and clear 
frailty score that could be used and mentioned to other healthcare professionals 
when handing over patients. Six frailty scores were reported to be used in 
prehospital care. The evidence around each frailty score is very limited. 
Overall, frailty assessment in prehospital care was shown to be important and 
feasible. Different frailty scores have been assessed for use in prehospital 
care. Further research investigating frailty identification in prehospital care 
is needed.",© 2023 Alshibani et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/OAEM.S409083

characterised by the demyelination of neurons in the central nervous system. 
Whilst it is unclear what precisely leads to MS, it is believed that genetic 
predisposition combined with environmental factors plays a pivotal role. It is 
estimated that close to half the disease risk is determined by genetic factors. 
However, the risk of developing MS cannot be attributed to genetic factors 
alone, and environmental factors are likely to play a significant role by 
themselves or in concert with host genetics. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection 
is the strongest known environmental risk factor for MS. There has been 
increasing evidence that leaves little doubt that EBV is necessary, but not 
sufficient, for developing MS. One plausible explanation is EBV may alter the 
host immune response in the presence of MS risk alleles and this contributes to 
the pathogenesis of MS. In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding how 
EBV infection may contribute to MS pathogenesis via interactions with genetic 
risk loci and discuss possible therapeutic interventions.","© 2023 The Authors. Clinical & Translational Immunology published by John Wiley

medication that may decrease chronic pain symptoms. LDN is most commonly used to 
treat fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and painful diabetic 
neuropathy. Other studies suggest that LDN provides general symptom reduction in 
inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis. We 
reviewed our experience with patients to whom we have prescribed LDN to see what 
types of painful conditions were most responsive to LDN in our patient 
population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts from patients who came to the Pain Center between 
2014 and 2021 were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the n = 137 patients who were prescribed LDN, 44% had no evidence of 
ever filling the prescription, and 4.4% of the responses were not charted. Of 
the remaining who took LDN (n = 70), 64% had some relief and were designated as 
'Responders'. The most common pain diagnosis was neuropathic pain which, when 
added to the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome, accounted for 51% of 
responders to LDN. Patients who experienced greater than 50% pain relief from 
LDN were more likely to have the diagnosis of neuropathic pain or complex 
regional pain syndrome (p = 0.038, Fisher's Exact Test). There was a significant 
difference in the diagnosis of patients who responded to LDN. Patients with 
spondylosis were much less likely to respond to LDN when compared with other 
diagnoses (p = 0.00435, Chi-Square Test).
CONCLUSION: Patients with all types of neuropathic pain, including CRPS, were 
significantly more likely to have pain relief from LDN than patients with 
spondylosis (p=0.018). The diagnosis of spondylosis was more often associated 
with a lack of response to LDN than any other diagnosis. Patients may need to 
have a trial of several weeks before analgesic effects are seen with LDN.",© 2023 McKenzie-Brown et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/JPR.S389957

consequences for mastering chronic pain.
METHODS: Our study included 22 patients (20 women, 2 men) with pTMD, refractory 
to conservative treatment, and 19 healthy controls. The control group was 
matched for gender, age, and educational level, and IQ tested on the Wechsler 
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Neurocognitive function was tested with the 
Color-Word Interference Test (CWIT). Pain intensity was reported according to 
the General Pain Intensity Questionnaire (GPI), using the Numeric Rating Scale 
(NRS). Self-perceived cognitive difficulties were reported by the Perceived 
Deficits Questionnaire-Depression 5-item (PDQ-5). Two measures of rumination 
were included: the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ) and the Ruminative 
Response Scale (RRS). The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale Self-report 
(MADRS-S) was used to measure depressive symptoms, and the Oral Health Impact 
Profile-TMD (OHIP-TMD) to measure QoL related to oral health.
RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in age (median pTMD: 55 years, 
median control: 53 years), educational level, and IQ between pTMD and controls. 
Median pain intensity in pTMD was NRS 8 at maximum and the median pain duration 
was 18 years. There were no significant differences in CWIT between pTMD and 
controls. Self-perceived cognitive function (PDQ) was significantly poorer in 
pTMD. Rumination scores from both measures, and the depression score from MADRS, 
were significantly higher in pTMD. The OHIP-TMD score revealed a significantly 
poorer QoL in pTMD.
CONCLUSION: The group of pTMD patients have self-perceived cognitive 
difficulties that may make it more difficult to master chronic pain and common 
everyday tasks. They reported significantly more self-perceived cognitive 
difficulties, higher rumination, more depressive symptoms, and lower QoL 
compared to healthy controls, suggesting that these psychosocial factors could 
be targeted in treatment and interventions. However, the tested neurocognitive 
performance was equivalent to the control group.",© 2023 Staniszewski et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/JPR.S414922

contributing to increased cesarean delivery rates and poor pregnancy outcomes, 
and this pain can be managed by labor analgesia. Many studies exist on labor 
analgesia, and the quantity and quality of these studies have not been reported. 
Therefore, we aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis of studies from 2002 to 
2021.
METHODS: We used the Web of Science database to obtain publications related to 
labor analgesia from January 2002 to December 2021. Various bibliographic 
information was collected, including country; author; journal; grant; 
discipline; institution and research hotspot. A total of 4536 papers were 
included.
RESULTS: A total of 4536 articles were included in the study. The country with 
the most published articles on labor analgesia and the country of the funding 
agency was the United States. Most articles were published in the disciplines 
Anesthesiology and Obstetrics & Gynecology. The journal that published the most 
articles in this category was International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia. In 
addition, we found different research hotspots for labor analgesia in the United 
States, Japan, and China.

that the skin temperature of some acupoints changes in primary dysmenorrhea (PD) 
patients. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in skin temperature at 
specific acupoints in PD patients and healthy subjects.
METHODS: The literature for assessing skin temperature at acupoints in PD 
patients and healthy subjects was searched in eight databases. The literatures 
obtained from the search was independently screened by two authors, and the 
quality of the included articles was evaluated using the consensus checklist of 
the Thermographic Imaging in Sports and Exercise Medicine (TISEM) and the 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) scale. The skin temperature of the relevant 
acupoints or the difference between the left and right acupoints of the same 
name was used as the outcome during any period of menstruation. Finally, the 
meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1 software to evaluate the changes 
in skin temperature in the related acupoints.
RESULTS: Seven eligible studies were included, which included 328 patients with 
PD and 279 healthy subjects. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a 
significant difference in skin temperature around the Sanyinjiao (SP6)(MD: 0.04, 
95% CI: 0.00, 0.08), Xuehai (SP 10)(MD: -0.07, 95% CI:-0.11, -0.02) and Taixi

territory mapping in living donor liver transplantation.
METHODS: Living donor liver transplantations performed using right graft since 
2017 were included. Hepatic venous volume mapping was started in 2019. Risk 
factors for graft failure and overall survival were analyzed. Analysis for 
factors related to occlusion of reconstructed vein was performed.
RESULTS: Among 445 patients included, 213 underwent hepatic venous mapping. 
Hepatic venous mapping itself was not a significant factor for graft (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.958; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.441-2.082; P = 0.913) and 
overall survival (HR, 0.627; 95% CI, 0.315-1.247; P = 0.183). Inferior hepatic 
vein occlusion was a significant risk factor for both graft survival (HR, 8.795; 
95% CI, 1.628-47.523; P = 0.012) and overall survival (HR, 11.13; 95% CI, 
2.460-50.300; P = 0.002). In a subgroup with middle hepatic vein reconstruction, 
occlusion was a significant risk factor for overall survival (HR, 3.289; 95% CI, 
1.304-8.296; P = 0.012). In patients with middle hepatic vein reconstruction 
whose venous territory volumes were measured, right anterior volume of ≥300 cm3 
was protective for vein occlusion (OR, 0.317; 95% CI, 0.152-0.662; P = 0.002). 
In patients with V5 reconstruction, V5 volume of ≥150 cm3 was protective for 
vein occlusion (OR, 0.253; 95% CI, 0.087-0.734; P = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: Inferior and middle hepatic vein reconstruction has significant 
impact on clinical outcome. Hepatic venous territory mapping can provide an 
objective measure for successful reconstruction of venous branches.","Copyright © 2023, the Korean Surgical Society.","DOI: 10.4174/astr.2023.104.6.348

emergency surgery is gradually increasing. The aim of this study was to find out 
the trends and results of emergency general surgery for elderly patients over 9 
years in an emergency medical center in South Korea, where the population is 
aging most rapidly.
METHODS: The clinical characteristics, outcomes, and medical expenses of 
emergency general surgery for the elderly (aged 65-79 years) and highly elderly 
(aged ≥80 years) patients who visited to a regional emergency medical center 
from 2012 to 2020 were analyzed.
RESULTS: The number of highly elderly patients increased with each 3-year 
interval, whereas the proportion of patients aged 19-79 years was similar, and 
that of pediatric patients was decreasing. The higher the age group, the higher 
the mortality (young adult vs. elderly vs. highly elderly: odds ratio [OR], 1 
vs. 3.689 vs. 11.293; P < 0.001) and complication rates (OR, 1 vs. 2.840 vs.

rectal cancer with a higher sphincter-saving rate without compromising oncologic 
results. There have been studies about the quality of life of rectal cancer 
patients after surgery. However, no study has reported the long-term annual 
incidence of depression after rectal cancer surgery according to stoma status. 
The objective of this study was to determine the annual incidence of depression 
after rectal cancer surgery and the factors affecting it, especially the 
prevalence of depression according to the presence or duration of a stoma.
METHODS: Using the Korea National Health Insurance Service database, patients 
who underwent radical surgery for rectal cancer from 2002 to 2019 were searched. 
We analyzed the incidence and risk factors of depression in patients who 
underwent radical surgery for rectal cancer according to stoma status.
RESULTS: Annual incidence of depression in rectal cancer patients was decreasing 
annually for 15 years after surgery. There was no statistically significant 
difference in the incidence of depression according to the stoma status. 
However, the diagnosis of depression within 1 year after surgery was 
statistically significantly increased in the permanent stoma group.
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the overall incidence of depressive 
disorders among patients with rectal cancer based on their stoma status. 
However, a permanent stoma seems to increase the incidence in the first year 
after surgery. Education and intensive assessments of depressive disorders in 
patients with permanent stoma within 1 year after surgery are needed, 
particularly for female patients who are under 50 years old.","Copyright © 2023, the Korean Surgical Society.","DOI: 10.4174/astr.2023.104.6.303

METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched 
for articles published up to November 9, 2022. We included randomized and 
non-randomized trials in which the effects of prehabilitation in patients with 
frailty undergoing colorectal cancer surgery were investigated against a control

RESULTS: Compared with the control group, we found a significant improvement in 
the incidence of postoperative complications and shorter LOS in the hospital in 
the prehabilitation group. However, the 6MWT and CCI results showed no 
significant differences between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: Prehabilitation in patients with frailty who underwent colorectal 
cancer surgery improved the incidence of postoperative complications and LOS in 
the hospital. Hence, clinicians should consider conducting or recommending

infected endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) grafts.
METHODS: This single-center, retrospective, observational study analyzed the 
data of 12 consecutive patients who underwent infected aortic stent graft 
explantation following EVAR between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019, of 
which 11 underwent in situ graft reconstruction following graft removal. The 
presentation symptoms, infection route, original pathology of abdominal aortic 
aneurysms (AAA), graft materials, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Six patients underwent total explantation, whereas 5 underwent removal 
of only the fabric portions. For in situ reconstructions, prosthetic grafts and 
banked allografts were used in 8 and 3 patients, respectively. Four mechanisms 
of graft infection were noted in 11 patients: 4 had bacteremia from systemic 
infections, 3 had persistent infections following EVAR of primary infected AAA, 
3 had ascending infections from adjacent abscesses, and 1 had an aneurysm sac 
erosion resulting in an aortoenteric fistula. No infection-related postoperative 
complications or reinfections occurred during the mean 65.27-month (standard 
deviation, ±52.51) follow-up period. One patient died postoperatively because of 
the rupture of the proximal aortic wall pseudoaneurysm that had occurred during 
forceful bare stent removal.
CONCLUSION: Regardless of graft material, in situ graft reconstruction is safe 
for interposition in treating an infected aortic stent graft following EVAR. In 
our experience, the residual bare stent is no longer a risk factor for 
reinfection. Therefore, it is important not to injure the proximal aortic wall 
when removing the bare stent by force.","Copyright © 2023, the Korean Surgical Society.","DOI: 10.4174/astr.2023.104.6.339

severity according to Tokyo Guidelines criteria (TG) 18/TG13, respectively. The 
morbidity rates determined in groups 1 and 2 were 26.7% (n = 28) and 51.9% (n = 
41), respectively. No mortality was found in group 1, whereas the mortality rate 
in group 2 was 6.3% (n = 5). According to multivariate analysis, CAR (odds ratio 
[OR], 1.234; P < 0.001) and MPI (OR, 1.175; P = 0.001) were found to be 
associated with moderate-severe disease while CAR (OR, 1.109; P = 0.035) and 
P-POSSUM morbidity (OR, 1.063; P = 0.007) variables were found to be associated 
with the presence of morbidity.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that CAR can be used in predicting severity of 
AC and that CAR is an alternative simple parameter of P-POSSUM morbidity score 
in prediction of morbidity in these cases. In addition to other assessment 
methods, these scores can provide valuable and complementary information in 
assessment of disease severity and prognosis in AC.","Copyright © 2023, the Korean Surgical Society.","DOI: 10.4174/astr.2023.104.6.332

transplantation (LT). Although the overall outcomes in older patients are not 
different from those of younger patients, there is no tool to predict LT 
prognosis in older patients. We hypothesized that a modified Charlson 
comorbidity index (mCCI) and 5-factor modified frailty index (mFI-5) can predict 
outcomes in older patients after LT.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 155 patients (aged >65 years) who 
underwent LT at Seoul National University Hospital. The recipients were 
subcategorized into 2 groups based on the mCCI score and mFI-5: the low (0-1) 
and high (2-5) mCCI groups, and low (≤0.4) and high (>0.4) mFI-5 groups. The 
independent effect of each variable on post-LT survival was determined using the 
mCCI subgroup, age at transplantation, sex, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, model for 
end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and mFI-5 subgroup.
RESULTS: The high-mCCI group (41 patients) showed significantly lower 1- and 
3-month and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival than the low-mCCI group. Using the Cox 
regression model, the mCCI, sex, and MELD score remained significant. The mFI-5 
was not a significant factor to predict patients' survival.
CONCLUSION: The mCCI and MELD scores could be used to predict post-LT survival 
in older patients.","Copyright © 2023, the Korean Surgical Society.","DOI: 10.4174/astr.2023.104.6.358

examining enrolment in Medicare medication therapy management programs. However, 
those studies were based on various eligibility scenarios because enrolment data 
were unavailable. This study tested for potential disparities in enrolment using 
actual MTM enrolment data.
METHODS: Medicare Parts A&B claims, Medication Therapy Management Data Files, 
and the Area Health Resources File from 2013 to 2014 and 2016 to 2017 were 
analysed in this retrospective analysis. An adjusted logistic regression 
compared odds of enrolment between racial/ethnic minorities and non-Hispanic 
Whites (Whites) in the total sample and subpopulations with diabetes, 
hypertension, or hyperlipidaemia. Trends in disparities were analysed by 
including interaction terms in regressions between dummy variables for 
race/ethnic minority groups and period 2016-2017.
KEY FINDINGS: Disparities in MTM enrolment were detected between Blacks and 
Whites with diabetes in 2013-2014 (Odds Ratio = 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval = 
0.75-0.81). This disparity improved from 2013-2014 to 2016-2017 for Blacks (Odds 
Ratio=1.08, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.04-1.11) but persisted in 2016-2017 
(Odds Ratio = 0.84, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.81-0.87). A disparity was 
identified between Blacks and Whites with hypertension in 2013-2014 (Odds Ratio 
= 0.92, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.89-0.95) but not in 2016-2017. Enrolment for 
all groups, however, declined between periods. For example, in the total sample, 
the odds of enrolment declined from 2013-2014 to 2016-2017 by 22% (Odds 
Ratio=0.78, 95% Confidence Interval=0.75-0.81).
CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in MTM enrolment were found between Blacks and 
Whites among Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in both periods and among 
individuals with hypertension in 2013-2014. As overall enrolment fell between 
periods, concerns about program enrolment remain.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the

care delivery, as it led to variable outcomes in different disease states 
including cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we evaluated the impact of 
coexisting COVID-19 on Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).
DESIGN/SETTING: We analyzed discharge records of AMI patients from the National 
Inpatient Sample (NIS) in the year 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using propensity score matching, we assessed the impact 
of COVID-19 infection on the in-hospital outcomes of patients presenting with 
AMI.
RESULTS: There were 1154 patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection and AMI 
who were matched with 109,990 patients with AMI and without COVID-19. We found 
that patients with COVID-19 who had AMI were less likely to have dyslipidemia 
(64.6 % vs. 70.4 %, p < 0.001), peripheral vascular disease (2.4 % vs. 3.8 % 
p = 0.0017), smoking history (23.5 % vs. 28.2 % p < 0.0001) and hypertension 
(37.1 % vs. 40.1 % p = 0.004).COVID-19 was associated with higher hospital 
mortality rates (Adjusted odds ratio aOR: 2.72, CI: 2.23-3.30, p < 0.001), 
cardiac arrest (aOR: 1.65, 95 % CI: 1.26-2.15, p < 0.001), cardiogenic shock 
(aOR:1.36,95 % CI: 1.10-1.68, p = 0.004) and respiratory failure (aOR:1.81, 95 % 
CI: 1.55-2.11 p < 0.001) compared to AMI patients without COVID-19. There was 
also a significant association between coexisting COVID-19 and longer duration 
of hospital stay (Adjusted mean differences:1.40, 95 % CI: 1.31-1.59 p < 0.0001)

technology recommended for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis 
(sSAS). Despite being available for over 15 years in Europe, with an extensive 
volume of clinical and economic evaluations across all surgical risk groups, 
there is little evidence on the identification of the key drivers of TAVI's 
cost-effectiveness. This study sought to identify these factors and quantify 
their role.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify published 
economic evaluations of TAVI. This was supplemented by health technology 
assessment reports. The primary outcome was the likelihood of TAVI being found 
cost-effective. Secondary outcomes of TAVI being dominant, and the incremental 
health benefits of TAVI were also explored.
RESULTS: Forty-two studies, reporting 65 unique analyses, were identified. TAVI 
was found to be cost-effective and dominant in 74% and 20% of analyses, 
respectively. The latest generation balloon-expandable TAVI device (SAPIEN 3) 
was more likely to be found cost-effective, as was TAVI use in low-risk 
populations and when performed via transfemoral access route. There was 
heterogeneity in the approach taken to economic modelling, which may also 
influence estimates of cost-effectiveness. Analyses that found TAVI to be 
dominant always compared it to surgery and usually considered the latest 
generation balloon-expandable TAVI device. Largest health benefits were observed 
for the inoperable risk group.
CONCLUSION: For patients with sSAS, TAVI is typically a cost-effective treatment 
option. There are important differences by device generation, risk group and 
access route. It is crucial to consider these differences when appraising the 
health economic evidence-base for TAVI.",© 2023 Heathcote et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/CEOR.S392566

considerable work in the field, the overwhelming evidence suggests that IBD 
patients as a whole do not appear to be at increased risk for more severe 
disease from COVID-19. Certain risk factors such as age, steroids, 
comorbidities, combination immunomodulatory therapy, and IBD disease activity 
have been associated with worse outcomes. Most IBD medications are low risk, 
with the exception of immunomodulator monotherapy and combination therapy with 
thiopurine and anti-TNF. Vaccination remains safe and effective for all IBD

in-person to online learning in Spring 2020.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of the 
transition on undergraduates during the period following the campus closure.
METHOD: 131 psychology undergraduate students completed an online survey of how 
the COVID-19 closure had impacted their academics, online learning environment, 
and traumatic stress symptoms (using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 
for the DSM-5).
RESULTS: Most participants reported increased academic difficulty compared to 
before closure. Approximately 30% reported elevated traumatic stress symptoms. 
Greater traumatic stress was associated with greater difficulty completing 
assignments, more limited access to the internet and quiet places to study, and 
greater sibling-care responsibilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The acute transition to online instruction posed academic and 
emotional challenges to many students, especially those from environments with 
competing demands or less access to academic supports. Follow-up evaluation is 
needed to determine whether these difficulties have persisted in subsequent 
semesters of online instruction.
TEACHING IMPLICATION: Instructors should anticipate the emotional and academic 
needs of students who are relatively unfamiliar with online instruction and 
consider ways to minimize negative environmental impacts and increase access to

Neuroscience, , London, King's College LondonUK.","BACKGROUND: The provision of pain management programmes (PMPs) changed 
substantially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with virtual delivery 
implemented in many services. Little is known about patient selection processes 
for virtual PMPs and how this might differ from in-person programmes. The aim of 
this audit was to document the patient selection process for PMPs at a 
speciality pain service prior to and during the pandemic.
METHODS: This retrospective audit used data from consecutive patients attending 
a multidisciplinary assessment to determine the suitability of a PMP. Anonymized 
data were extracted from assessment letters and hospital records in the months 
prior to the pandemic (n =168) and during the start of the pandemic once the 
service began delivering virtual PMPs (n =171).
RESULTS: For the standard pain management pathway, most patients were offered a 
PMP option within the service before and during the pandemic, although a greater 
proportion of patients were offered treatment during the pandemic. For the 
neuromodulation pathway, most patients were offered a pre-neuromodulation PMP 
option, and this was similar before and during the pandemic. Psychosocial 
complexities and unwillingness to engage in a pain management approach that does 
not principally focus on pain reduction were the most common reasons that 
patients were not offered a programme.
DISCUSSION: This audit points to a pattern of more inclusive assessment outcomes 
within our service over time and particularly during the pandemic. Offering a 
range of in-person and virtual PMPs can meet a wider range of patient need. 
Research is needed to understand how to best assess and match patients with the 
breadth of treatment delivery formats now available.",© The Author(s) 2022.,"DOI: 10.1177/20494637221147200

in the country corresponds to this finding and is only on an average level. 
Smartphones are more accessible but are often old or of lower quality. Internet 
connections are available but are vulnerable to disruptions initiated by the 
military regime. Therefore, it can be concluded that students in Myanmar in many 
cases did not have the technical equipment or skills necessary to learn 
effectively through the usage of IT during the national crises. Nevertheless, it 
can be stated that IT helped and was also supportive in sustaining and improving

at such an accelerated rate that habitat modification is considered a leading 
threat to biodiversity. Sharks and rays are considered the second most 
threatened group of vertebrates that have also suffered from habitat loss, 
especially in nursery grounds and reef-associated species. In this sense, 
actions toward the conservation of critical grounds for species survival are 
urgently needed, especially for those threatened with extinction. This study 
aimed to gather and provide information on the worldwide distribution and 
habitat association of the 'vulnerable' Atlantic Nurse Shark Ginglymostoma 
cirratum through a literature review performed at the Dimensions research 
database. A total of 30 studies published between 1950 and 2021 were retained 
since they defined at least the type of habitat in which G. cirratum was 
associated. Most studies covered the Floridian ecoregion, where G. cirratum is 
more common and abundant. Reefs, seagrass, sandy, rocky, mangrove, and 
macroalgae accounted for the majority of habitat associations, with a higher 
diversity of habitats detected within marine protected areas (MPAs). 
Ginglymostoma cirratum was recorded at a maximum depth of 75 m, temperatures 
ranging from 25 °C to 34 °C, and salinities between 31 and 38 ppt. Neonates were 
associated with shallower habitats (<20 m), mostly reefs, rocks, macroalgae, 
sandy shores, and seagrass, in an average temperature of 26 °C and salinity of 
36 ppt. Breeding events and habitats were reported by 11 studies, 72.7% of them 
in shallow waters, mostly inside MPAs (90.9%). Our findings highlighted the key 
role played by MPAs in protecting essential grounds for threatened species, such 
as the Atlantic Nurse Shark. Major ecoregions (e.g., the Eastern Atlantic) are 
still underrepresented in the scientific literature as long as studies aim 
specifically to assess G. cirratum habitat association. Thus, further insights 
into the essential habitats needed to conserve the Atlantic Nurse Shark can 
still emerge from future studies. Considering the recent IUCN extinction risk 
status change in G. cirratum (i.e., Data Deficient to 'Vulnerable'), new 
conservation measures that integrate habitat protection and management are 
urgently needed and should consider the data collected herein.",© 2023 Bettcher et al.,"DOI: 10.7717/peerj.15540

fatigue, sleep, and mood in athletes after returning to training following 
infection with the COVID-19 Omicron strain and provide recommendations for 
returning to training after infection.
METHODS: Two hundred and thirty professional athletes who had returned to 
training after being infected with COVID-19 in December 2022 were recruited to 
participate in three tests conducted from early January 2023. The second test 
was completed approximately 1 week after the first, and the third was completed 
about 2 weeks after the second. Each test consisted of completing scales and the 
exercise-induced fatigue measure. The scales included a visual analog scale, the 
Athens Insomnia Scale for non-clinical application, and the 
Depression-Anxiety-Stress scale. The exercise task was a six-minute stair climb 
test, and athletes evaluated subjective fatigue levels before and after exercise 
using another Visual Analog Scale and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale.
RESULTS: After returning to training, athletes' physical fatigue decreased 
initially but increased as training progressed. Cognitive fatigue did not change 
significantly. The exercise task led to elevated levels of physical fatigue 
after a longer duration of training. Sleep quality problems decreased rapidly 
after the start of training but remained stable with prolonged training. 
Depression levels continued to decline, while anxiety levels only reduced after 
a longer duration of training. Stress levels decreased rapidly after the start 
of training but did not change with prolonged training.
CONCLUSION: Athletes who return to training after recovering from COVID-19 
experience positive effects on their fatigue, sleep, and mood. It is important 
to prioritize anxiety assessment and interventions during the short period after 
returning and to continue monitoring fatigue levels and implementing recovery 
interventions over a longer period of time.",© 2023 Tan et al.,"DOI: 10.7717/peerj.15580

lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for poor outcomes within 90-day in hospitalized patients 
with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).
METHODS: A retrospective study including 503 AECOPD patients was performed, and 
the subjects' clinical characteristics were collected. Binary logistic 
regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for 90-day poor outcomes 
in patients with AECOPD. Receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) and 
areas under the curves (AUC) were used to assess the ability of different 
biomarkers to predict the risk of 90-day mortality, readmission and 
re-exacerbation in patients with AECOPD.
RESULTS: During the follow-up, 188 patients (38.4%) redeveloped exacerbations, 
112 patients (22.9%) were readmitted, and 20 patients (4.1%) died directly 
resulted from COPD or COPD-related causes. Multivariate analysis demonstrated 
that age>72 years (OR: 14.817, 95% CI: 1.561-140.647), NLR>14.17 (OR: 9.611, 95% 
CI: 2.303-40.113), EOS<0.15% (OR: 8.621, 95% CI: 3.465-34.913) and BNP>2840ng/L 
(OR: 5.291, 95% CI: 1.367-20.474) at discharge were independent risk factors for 
90-day mortality in AECOPD patients. NLR was the optimal biomarker for 
predicting 90-day mortality with an AUC of 0.802 (95% CI: 0.631-0.973). Using 
14.17 as the critical value of NLR, the sensitivity was 76.7%, and the 
specificity was 88.9%. Compared with mortality, NLR had no significant advantage 
in predicting risk of short-term re-exacerbation (AUC=0.580, 95% CI:0.529-0.632, 
p=0.001) and readmission (AUC=0.555, 95% CI:0.497-0.614, p=0.045), with AUCs 
less than 0.6. In contrast, the predictive value of EOS (AUC=0.561, 95% 
CI:0.502-0.621, p=0.038) was slightly better than NLR in terms of readmission 
within 90 days. CRP did not serve as a well predictive biomarker for the risk of 
readmission and re-deterioration (p>0.05).

especially COPD associated mortality, in hospitalized patients with AECOPD

identification and diagnostic applications to reduce the time needed for sample 
preparation. After peptide functionalization of superparamagnetic iron oxide 
nanoparticles (SPIONs) with an appropriate interface, they can be used for the 
separation of sepsis-associated yeasts like Candida albicans. Due to their 
magnetic properties, the magnetic extraction of the particles in the presence of 
an external magnetic field ensures the accumulation of the targeted yeast.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we used SPIONs coated with 
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and functionalized with a peptide 
originating from GP340 (SPION-APTES-Pep). For the first time, we investigate 
whether this system is suitable for the separation and enrichment of Candida 
albicans, we investigated its physicochemical properties and by 
thermogravimetric analysis we determined the amount of peptide on the SPIONs. 
Further, the toxicological profile was evaluated by recording cell cycle and DNA 
degradation. The separation efficiency was investigated using Candida albicans 
in different experimental settings, and regrowth experiments were carried out to 
show the use of SPION-APTES-Pep as a sample preparation method for the 
identification of fungal infections.
CONCLUSION: SPION-APTES-Pep can magnetically remove more than 80% of the 
microorganism and with a high selective host-pathogen distinction Candida 
albicans from water-based media and about 55% in blood after 8 minutes 
processing without compromising effects on the cell cycle of human blood cells.

(#)Contributed equally","PURPOSE: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is more representative and accurate than 
biopsy and is also conducive to dynamic monitoring, facilitating accurate 
diagnosis and prognosis of glioma. Therefore, the present study aimed to 
establish and validate a novel amplified method for the detection of IDH1 R132H 
and BRAF V600E, which were associated with the genetic diagnosis of glioma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A dual-signal amplification method based on magnetic 
aggregation and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) was constructed for the 
simultaneous detection of ctDNAs. When target ctDNAs are present, the CHA 
reaction is initiated and leads to the assembly of Au-Ag nanoshuttles (Au-Ag 
NSs) onto magnetic beads (MBs). Further enrichment of MBs under an external 
magnetic field facilitated the dual-signal amplification of SERS.
RESULTS: The limit of detection (LOD) for IDH1 R132H and BRAF V600E in serum was 
as low as 6.01 aM and 5.48 aM. The reproducibility and selectivity of the 
proposed SERS analysis platform was satisfactory. Finally, the platform was 
applied to quantify IDH1 R132H and BRAF V600E in the serum of 
subcutaneous-tumor‑bearing nude mice, and the results obtained by SERS were 
consistent with those from quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR).

(#)Contributed equally","The real problem in pharmaceutical preparation is drugs' poor aqueous 
solubility, low permeability through biological membranes, and short biological 
t1/2. Conventional drug delivery systems are not able to overcome these 
problems. However, cyclodextrins (CDs) and their derivatives can solve these 
challenges. This article aims to summarize and review the history, properties, 
and different applications of cyclodextrins, especially the ability of inclusion 
complex formation. It also refers to the effects of cyclodextrin on drug 
solubility, bioavailability, and stability. Moreover, it focuses on preparing 
and applying gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as novel drug delivery systems. It also 
studies the uses and effects of cyclodextrins in this field as novel drug 
carriers and targeting devices. The system formulated from AuNPs linked with CD 
molecules combines the advantages of both CD and AuNPs. Cyclodextrins benefit in 
increasing aqueous drug solubility, loading capacity, stability, and size 
control of gold NPs. Also, AuNPs are applied as diagnostic and therapeutic 
agents because of their unique chemical properties. Plus, AuNPs possess several 
advantages such as ease of detection, targeted and selective drug delivery, 
greater surface area, high loading efficiency, and higher stability than 
microparticles. In the present article, we tried to present the potential 
pharmaceutical applications of CD-derived AuNPs in biomedical applications 
including antibacterial, anticancer, gene-drug delivery, and various targeted 
drug delivery applications. Also, the article highlighted the role of CDs in the 
preparation and improvement of catalytic enzymes, the formation of 
self-assembling molecular print boards, the fabrication of supramolecular 
functionalized electrodes, and biosensors formation.",© 2023 Abdellatif et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S405964

to unparalleled disruption and has impacted healthcare services, leading to 
significant morbidity and mortality in the worldwide population. Insufficient 
data on the management of COVID-19 complications such as hypercoagulability and 
the controversy about the benefits of anticoagulant therapy are major challenges 
encountered by clinicians, especially for patients with pre-existing 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and are still debatable. Therefore, we endeavored 
to conduct a systematic review to assess the clinical outcomes of prior 
anticoagulant therapy in patients with COVID-19 having pre-existing CVD. 
Electronic searches of the PubMed database and EBSCO Information Services were 
carried out, and all relevant articles were employed. Seven articles with data 
from 21,989 subjects were included. Despite the promised clinical outcomes of 
anticoagulant therapy, the results of the current systematic review indicated 
insignificant improvements in the reduction of mortality rate or ICU admission 
among patients with COVID-19 having pre-existing CVD. Furthermore, direct oral 
anticoagulant (DOAC) were favored over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) due to 
better action and less side effects. In conclusion, the findings are 
controversial as we did not statistically analyze the results. The data showed 
inconsistent information with no clear effect of anticoagulant use before 
patient hospitalization or decreasing COVID-19 severity, particularly in those 
with CVD. Further studies including randomized controlled trials are required to 
describe the best course as well as optimal dose of anticoagulant use in the 
treatment of patients with COVID-19, particularly those with comorbidities such

Kunming, Yunnan, People's Republic of China.","OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics of necrotizing pneumonia (NP) 
caused by different pathogens.
METHODS: A total of 282 children with NP admitted to Kunming Children's Hospital 
from January 2014 to November 2022 were enrolled. The clinical data of all 
children was collected. According to the different pathogens causing NP, the 
children were divided into three groups: the Mycoplasma pneumoniae necrotizing 
pneumonia (MPNP) group, the bacterial necrotizing pneumonia (BNP) group, and 
necrotizing pneumonia with no pathogen detected (NNP) group. The basic 
information, symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, radiological features, 
treatment, and prognosis of the three groups were compared.
RESULTS: Among the 282 cases of NP, there were 62 (22.0%) cases of MPNP, 98 
(34.75%) cases of BNP, and 142 (50.35%) cases of NNP. The most common bacteria 
causing NP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus 
influenzae, and Acinetobacter baumannii, respectively. Most clinical features of 
the three groups were statistically significant. The area under the 
concentration curve of white blood cell, C-reactive protein, albumin, neutrophil 
percentage, and fibrinogen in differentiating MPNP from BNP were 0.743 
(0.638-0.849), 0.797 (0.711-0.883), 0.766 (0.671-0.861), 0.616 (0.509-0.724), 
and 0.634 (0.523-0.744), respectively. The decision curve showed that white 
blood cells, albumin, and C-reactive protein had good clinical application in 
differentiating MPNP from BNP. All patients were improved and discharged without 
death.
CONCLUSION: Bacteria are the most common cause of NP, and the most common 
bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus 
influenzae. NP with no pathogen detected accounted for a large proportion. white 
blood, C-reactive protein, and albumin can identify the pathogens of NP.

However, designing a proper network is challenging due to limited information

purposes, where demand correlations exist and demand information is limited, 
i.e., only the mean demand and covariance matrix are known. Note that the 
covariance matrix can explicitly capture the correlated demand among areas. We 
formulate this problem as a mixed-integer two-stage distributionally robust 
location-inventory model, which is generally NP-hard and computationally 
intractable. The model is further reformulated as a mixed-integer conic problem 
based on copositive cones, and it is tractable with positive semidefinite 
relaxation. To accelerate the problem-solving process, we design an 
interpretable branching-and-pricing heuristic with a warm start. Both semi-case

acquired infection in sub-Saharan Africa, associated with increased morbidity 
and mortality. This study was aimed at determining the incidence and outcomes of 
surgical site infection following emergency laparotomy during the COVID -19 
pandemic in a low resource setting.
METHODS: This was a retrospective single Centre cohort of patients that had 
emergency laparotomy between July 2021-June 2022 (COVID period) and July 
2018-June 2019 (pre-COVID period). Analysis was done using SPSS version 22 in 
which SSI rates were compared between the two periods using the chi squared 
test. Mortality, re-operation rates and length of hospital stay were also 
compared.
RESULTS: Of the 453 patient files included in analysis, 244 (53.9%) were for the 
COVID period, while 209 (46.1%) were for the pre COVID period. The incidence of 
SSI was insignificantly higher in the COVID period (17.6% versus 16.7%; 
P = 0.901). Mortality was also insignificantly higher in the SSI group (3.8% 
versus 3.5%; P = 0.745). Presence of surgical site infection increased the risk 
for re-operation (P < 0.001) and prolonged hospital stay (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Since the incidence and outcomes of surgical site infection appear 
not to have changed following the pandemic, the same measures that were 
previously used to prevent SSI could still be effective even during the pandemic 
if followed appropriately and combined with the COVID specific peri-operative 
care recommendations.",© 2023 The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1016/j.ijso.2023.100641

growing, but published expert guidance is limited.
OBJECTIVE: Review aesthetic concerns of the lower face and neck and provide 
expert guidance on evaluation and treatment.
METHODS: Twelve international experts participated in an advisory board on lower 
face and neck aesthetic treatment. They completed a premeeting survey and met 
twice, reviewing responses and discussing patient evaluation and treatment 
strategies. They developed decision tree algorithms on patient assessment and 
treatment planning and sequencing, using clinical cases as a reference.
RESULTS: Treatment concerns include neck and lower face skin laxity, structural 
bone deficiency, insufficient or excess volume, submental fat, jowls, platysma 
bands, and masseter muscle prominence. Advisors agreed that the lower face and 
neck may be the most challenging areas to assess and treat; treatment goals 
include lower facial contour and overall facial harmony/balance. Advisors 
recommended first ruling out a surgical approach, then determining whether 
midface treatment is needed to support the lower face, and lastly evaluating the 
lower face for significant submental fat, excess or insufficient volume, and 
structural bone deficiency. To treat the lower face and neck, an anatomical 
layer approach, moving from deep to superficial layers, beginning with 
structural support, was recommended. Assessment and treatment decision trees 
were based on this approach.

micro-needling applications with a dexpanthenol-containing ointment (DCO) using 
3D skin models.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, full-thickness human 3D skin 
models were treated with a micro-needling device according to its clinical 
application. For post-treatment, some of the models were additionally treated 
with a dexpanthenol-containing ointment (DCO). Histological samples were taken 
at 0, 24 and 48 hours. Gene expression analysis was performed after 24 hours.
RESULTS: Histological examination showed that DCO post-treated 3D skin models 
revealed a completed wound closure 24 hours after the micro-needling procedure. 
In contrast, DCO-untreated models still clearly exhibited the micro-needling 
lesions after the same period of time. After 48 hours, all models revealed a 
completed wound healing. In skin models that received micro-needling but no 
post-treatment with DCO, microarray analysis identified an upregulation of 
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a downregulation of skin barrier 
and differentiation markers. In contrast, post-treatment with DCO leads to 
accelerated wound healing without affecting the initial inflammatory response 
caused by micro-needling, which leads to the subsequent collagen expression. 
This data was supported by qRT-PCR analyses.
CONCLUSION: Post-treatment with DCO accelerates epidermal wound healing after 
micro-needling of 3D skin models without impairing the immunostimulatory 
properties of micro-needling. These findings can help to optimise the aftercare 
routine after micro-needling procedures and to shorten the downtime for the

pathogens Parastagonospora nodorum and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, 
respectively, often occur together as a leaf spotting disease complex on wheat 
(Triticum aestivum L.). Both pathogens produce necrotrophic effectors (NEs) that 
contribute to the development of disease. Here, genome-wide association analysis 
of a diverse panel of 264 winter wheat lines revealed novel loci on chromosomes 
5A and 5B associated with sensitivity to the NEs SnTox3 and SnTox5 in addition 
to the known sensitivity genes for NEs Ptr/SnToxA, SnTox1, SnTox3, and SnTox5. 
Sensitivity loci for SnTox267 and Ptr ToxB were not detected. Evaluation of the 
panel with five P. nodorum isolates for SNB development indicated the 
Snn3-SnTox3 and Tsn1-SnToxA interactions played significant roles in disease 
development along with additional QTL on chromosomes 2A and 2D, which may 
correspond to the Snn7-SnTox267 interaction. For tan spot, the Tsc1-Ptr ToxC 
interaction was associated with disease caused by two isolates, and a novel QTL 
on chromosome 7D was associated with a third isolate. The Tsn1-ToxA interaction 
was associated with SNB but not tan spot. Therefore some, but not all, of the 
previously characterized host gene-NE interactions in these pathosystems play 
significant roles in disease development in winter wheat. Based on these 
results, breeders should prioritize the selection of resistance alleles at the 
Tsc1, Tsn1, Snn3, and Snn7 loci as well as the 2A and 7D QTL to obtain good 
levels of resistance to SNB and tan spot in winter wheat.

motivation, personality traits, and academic performance, but little is known 
about the role of personality traits in the relationship between foreign 
language learners' motivation and academic performance, especially in the 
Chinese setting, where English is taken as a compulsory course in universities.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to fill the gap by investigating the relationship 
between English learning motivation and academic performance among English 
majors in China and identifying the moderating role of certain personality 
traits, sequentially providing some implications for improving college English 
teaching strategies in China.
METHODS: English majors (N=273) from different types of universities in China 
were recruited to complete the revised version of the English learning 
motivation scale and big five personality traits scales via an online survey 
platform. Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses and hierarchical 
regression analyses were performed to explore the relationships among the three 
variables.
RESULTS: Results demonstrated that English learning motivation and openness both 
significantly influenced academic performance and significant interaction 
effects were found between English learning motivation and agreeableness. 
Specifically, agreeableness partially moderated the relationship between English 
learning motivation and academic performance, and English learning motivation 
had a positive effect on academic performance only for learners with lower 
levels of agreeableness.
CONCLUSION: These findings not only addressed the gap of the moderating role of 
personality traits in the motivation-performance relationship but also extended 
our knowledge of the roles of English learning motivation and certain 
personality traits in English learning within the context of China, where 
English is taken as a foreign language, thus providing practical suggestions for

(2)Department of Psychology, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, People's 
Republic of China.","INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown that Chinese language learning anxiety among 
international students in China can negatively affect their psychological 
adjustment. However, the specific effects and conditions of learning anxiety 
need to be further investigated. This study explored the mediating effects 
between Chinese language learning anxiety and psychological adjustment of 
international students in China.
METHODS: Chinese Learning Anxiety Scale, Campus Adaptability Scale for 
International Students in China, Academic Resilience Questionnaire for 
International Students in China, Zung's Self-Rated Depression Scale were 
administered to 307 international students from Nanjing Normal University in 
China, including 165 male students and 131 female students, aged 19-28 (M 
=21.42; SD = 1.528).
RESULTS: Chinese language learning anxiety significantly predicted the 
psychological well-being of international students after controlling for gender 
and age variables. Furthermore, Chinese language learning anxiety predicted the 
mental health of students through the independent mediating effect of campus 
adaptation and academic resilience, as well as the chain mediating effect of 
campus adaptation and academic resilience.
CONCLUSION: The study has theoretical and practical significance for improving 
international students' psychological adaptation and health, and implications 
for those involved in the management and teaching of international students in 
China. The research conclusions are as follows: firstly, when the Chinese 
learning anxiety of international students in China is strong, their campus 
adaptation and psychological resilience are reduced, and levels of depression 
increase; secondly, grades are significantly correlated with anxiety dimensions, 
and higher grades are associated with lower anxiety levels; finally, the

well as neurological, social, and behavioral difficulties.
LIMITATIONS: This illness is often assessed using the Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, 
and Eye-opener examination technique, which assesses the intensity of an alcohol 
problem. This technique is protracted, arduous, error-prone, and errant.
METHOD: As a result, the intention of this paper is to design a cutting-edge 
system for automatically identifying alcoholism utilizing electroencephalography 
(EEG) signals, that can alleviate these problems and aid practitioners and 
investigators. First, we investigate the feasibility of using the Fast 
Walsh-Hadamard transform of EEG signals to explore the unpredictable essence and 
variability of EEG indicators in the suggested framework. Second, thirty-six 
linear and nonlinear features for deciphering the dynamic pattern of healthy and 
alcoholic EEG signals are discovered. Subsequently, we suggested a strategy for 
selecting powerful features. Finally, nineteen machine learning algorithms and 
five neural network classifiers are used to assess the overall performance of 
selected attributes.
RESULTS: The extensive experiments show that the suggested method provides the 
best classification efficiency, with 97.5% accuracy, 96.7% sensitivity, and 
98.3% specificity for the features chosen using the correlation-based FS 
approach with Recurrent Neural Networks. With recently introduced matrix 
determinant features, a classification accuracy of 93.3% is also attained. 
Moreover, we developed a novel index that uses clinically meaningful features to 
differentiate between healthy and alcoholic categories with a unique integer. 
This index can assist health care workers, commercial companies, and design 
engineers in developing a real-time system with 100% classification results for 
the computerized framework.","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

for pharmacological treatment of asthma. Valid study of real-world treatment 
patterns using dispensing databases includes proper measurement of medication 
adherence. We aim to explore such patterns by applying a time-varying proportion 
of days covered (tPDC)-based algorithm.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We designed a retrospective inception cohort study using 
the University of Groningen IADB.nl community pharmacy dispensing database. 
Included were 19,184 young adults who initiated asthma medication anywhere 
between 1994 and 2021, in the Netherlands. Main treatment steps were defined as: 
1 - SABA/ICS-formoterol as needed, 2 - low dose ICS, 3 - low dose ICS + LABA or 
tiotropium, or intermediate dose ICS, 4 - intermediate to high dose ICS + LABA 
or tiotropium, triple therapy, or high dose ICS, 5 - treatment prescribed by a 
specialist. Changes in treatment steps were determined using a time-varying 
proportion of days covered (tPDC)-based algorithm. Individual drug treatment 
trajectories were visualized over time using a lasagna plot.
RESULTS: At initiation, of the 19,184 included individuals, 52%, 7%, 15%, 16%, 
and 10% started treatment in steps 1 to 5, respectively. The median (IQR) 
follow-up time was 3 (1-7) years. Median (IQR) number of switches was 1 (0-3). 
Comparing starting step to last observed step, 37% never switched between 
treatment steps, 20% of individuals stepped down and 22% stepped up.
CONCLUSION: The low proportion of treatment switches between steps indicates 
that tailoring of treatment to patients' needs might be suboptimal. The 
tPDC-based algorithm functions well in translating dispensing data into 
continuous drug-utilization data, enabling a more granular assessment of 
treatment patterns among asthma patients.",© 2023 Mommers et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/CLEP.S410036

(#)Contributed equally","Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is one of the major types of EB, a rare 
hereditary group of trauma-induced blistering skin disorders. DEB is caused by 
inherited pathogenic variants in the COL7A1 gene, which encodes type VII 
collagen, the major component of anchoring fibrils which maintain adhesion 
between the outer epidermis and underlying dermis. DEB can be subclassified into 
dominant (DDEB) and recessive (RDEB) forms. Generally, DDEB has a milder 
phenotype, while RDEB patients often have more extensive blistering, chronic 
inflammation, skin fibrosis, and a propensity for squamous cell carcinoma 
development, collectively impacting on daily activities and life expectancy. At 
present, best practice treatments are mostly supportive, and thus there is a 
considerable burden of disease with unmet therapeutic need. Over the last 20 
years, considerable translational research efforts have focused on either trying 
to cure DEB by direct correction of the COL7A1 gene pathology, or by modifying 
secondary inflammation to lessen phenotypic severity and improve patient 
symptoms such as poor wound healing, itch, and pain. In this review, we provide 
an overview and update on various therapeutic innovations for DEB, including 
gene therapy, cell-based therapy, protein therapy, and disease-modifying and 
symptomatic control agents. We outline the progress and challenges for each 
treatment modality and identify likely prospects for future clinical impact.",© 2023 Hou et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/TCRM.S386923

also be the presenting feature of a Chiari malformation. Our case is that of a 
39-year-old female who had a chronic cough associated with shortness of breath, 
and when severe, associated with loss of consciousness. Her cough was refractory 
to conventional management. Further workup including pulmonary functions tests 
(PFT), laryngoscopy, high-resolution CT of the chest, an upper GI series, and 
esophageal pH manometry study were all normal. An MRI of her brain was obtained 
due to her syncopal episodes and revealed findings concerning a type 1 Chiari 
malformation. She subsequently underwent a Chiari decompression with patchy 
duraplasty and tonsilloplasty with cervical vertebrae 1 and 2 (C1-C2) 
laminectomy with a resolution of her symptoms. Chiari malformations are 
sometimes inherited but are often sporadic in nature, and, thus, appropriate 
diagnosis is key. Our patient is unique in that she presented at an older age, 
suggesting that atypical etiologies of a chronic cough refractory to 
conventional treatments must be considered.","Copyright © 2023, Patel et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.40598

as the protrusion of abdominal viscera through a defect in the umbilical ring. 
Since most UHs close spontaneously, almost no active treatment has been 
performed. Adhesive strapping (AS) for early UH closure is an easy-to-perform 
and relatively safe treatment. However, it can present rare but serious 
complications. Herein, we report a case of a three-month-old infant with 
incarcerated UH during AS therapy. AS treatment for UH, which has been reported 
mainly in Japan, has shown excellent results in observational studies and could 
be widely applied globally. However, our case demonstrated the presence of a 
noteworthy complication; incarcerated UH, in addition to skin complications, 
such as cellulitis and skin ulcer-related perforation, was associated with AS. 
To minimize the occurrence of these complications associated with AS treatment 
for UH, it is crucial to adequately explain and guide the family members 
regarding the proper management of AS and seeking medical care promptly when 
abnormalities occur during AS.","Copyright © 2023, Miyahara et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.40590

significant swelling and confirming the suspicion of myositis as his muscle 
strength in his lower extremities took significant time to improve. As days 
passed, his muscle strength improved significantly and his creatine phosphatase 
kinase (CPK) values trended down, indicating that his myositis was improving as 
well. He was transitioned to oral prednisone 60 mg daily and was discharged home 
with a rheumatology follow-up to define long-term treatment. A myositis panel 
revealed anti-glycyl-transferRNA synthetase (EJ) autoantibody positivity and a

uncommon, it can lead to problems if not treated effectively in the early 
period. This study aimed to compare the effects of treatment with nintedanib and 
pirfenidone in patients with COVID-19-related fibrosis.
METHODS: Thirty patients who presented to the post-COVID outpatient clinic 
between May 2021 and April 2022 with a history of COVID-19 pneumonia and 
exhibited persistent cough, dyspnea, exertional dyspnea, and low oxygen 
saturation at least 12 weeks after diagnosis were included. The patients were 
randomized to receive off-label treatment with nintedanib or pirfenidone and 
were followed up for 12 weeks.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, all pulmonary function test (PFT) 
parameters, 6MWT distance, and oxygen saturation were increased compared to 
baseline in both the pirfenidone group and nintedanib groups, while heart rate 
and radiological score levels were decreased (p < 0.05 for all). The changes in 
6MWT distance and oxygen saturation were significantly greater in the nintedanib 
group than in the pirfenidone group (p = 0.02 and 0.005, respectively). Adverse 
drug effects were more frequent with nintedanib than pirfenidone, with the most 
common being diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
CONCLUSION: In patients with interstitial fibrosis after COVID-19 pneumonia, 
both nintedanib and pirfenidone were observed to be effective in improving 
radiological score and PFT parameters. Nintedanib was more effective than 
pirfenidone in increasing exercise capacity and saturation values but caused 
more adverse drug effects.","Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: Aunque la fibrosis pulmonar secundaria a la infección

efectiva en el período inicial. Este estudio tuvo como objetivo comparar los 
efectos del tratamiento con nintedanib y pirfenidona en pacientes con fibrosis 
relacionada con COVID-19.
MÉTODOS: Se incluyeron 30 pacientes que acudieron a la consulta externa 
post-COVID entre mayo de 2021 y abril de 2022 con antecedentes de neumonía por 
COVID-19 y presentaron tos persistente, disnea, disnea de esfuerzo y baja 
saturación de oxígeno al menos 12 semanas después del diagnóstico. Los pacientes 
fueron aleatorizados para recibir un tratamiento no aprobado con nintedanib o 
pirfenidona y fueron seguidos durante 12 semanas.
RESULTADOS: Después de 12 semanas de tratamiento, todos los parámetros de la 
prueba de función pulmonar (PFT), la distancia de la PM6M y la saturación de 
oxígeno aumentaron en comparación con los valores basales tanto en el grupo de 
pirfenidona como en el de nintedanib, mientras que la frecuencia cardíaca y los 
niveles de puntuación radiológica disminuyeron (p < 0,05 para todos). Los 
cambios en la distancia de la PM6M y la saturación de oxígeno fueron 
significativamente mayores en el grupo de nintedanib que en el grupo de 
pirfenidona (p = 0,02 y p = 0,005, respectivamente). Los efectos adversos del 
fármaco fueron más frecuentes con nintedanib que con pirfenidona, siendo los más 
comunes diarrea, náuseas y vómitos.
CONCLUSIÓN: En pacientes con fibrosis intersticial después de neumonía por

mejorar la puntuación radiológica y los parámetros de la PFT. Nintedanib fue más 
eficaz que pirfenidona para aumentar la capacidad de ejercicio y los valores de 
saturación, pero provocó más efectos adversos del fármaco.","© 2023 Elsevier España, S.L.U. All rights reserved.","DOI: 10.1016/j.medcle.2022.12.019

lung ultrasound score (LUS) to classify COVID-19 pneumonia severity.
METHODS: Initially, we conducted a systematic review among previously proposed 
LUS cut-off points. Then, these results were validated by a single-centre 
prospective cohort study of adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Studied variables were poor outcome (ventilation support, intensive care unit 
admission or 28-days mortality) and 28-days mortality.
RESULTS: From 510 articles, 11 articles were included. Among the cut-off points 
proposed in the articles included, only the LUS > 15 cut-off point could be 
validated for its original endpoint, demonstrating also the strongest relation 
with poor outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 3.636, confidence interval [CI] 
1.411-9.374). Regarding our cohort, 127 patients were admitted. In these 
patients, LUS was statistically associated with poor outcome (OR = 1.303, CI 
1.137-1.493), and with 28-days mortality (OR = 1.024, CI 1.006-1.042). LUS > 15 
showed the best diagnostic performance when choosing a single cut-off point in 
our cohort (area under the curve 0.650). LUS ≤ 7 showed high sensitivity to rule 
out poor outcome (0.89, CI 0.695-0.955), while LUS > 20 revealed high 
specificity to predict poor outcome (0.86, CI 0.776-0.917).
CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a good predictor of poor outcome and 28-days mortality in 
COVID-19. LUS ≤ 7 cut-off point is associated with mild pneumonia, LUS 8-20 with 
moderate pneumonia and ≥20 with severe pneumonia. If a single cut-off point were

long-term behavior of epidemiological models and has been widely used to study 
the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we present a 
finite-time stability analysis of a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered 
(SIR) epidemic compartmental model with switching signals. The model includes a 
linear parameter variation (LPV) and switching system that represents the impact 
of external factors, such as changes in public health policies or seasonal 
variations, on the transmission rate of the disease. We use the Lyapunov 
stability theory to examine the long-term behavior of the model and determine 
conditions under which the disease is likely to die out or persist in the 
population. By taking advantage of the average dwell time method and Lyapunov 
functional (LF) method, and using novel inequality techniques the finite-time 
stability (FTS) criterion in linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is developed. The 
finite-time stability of the resultant closed-loop system, with interval and

are that can occur during playing padel. This study aimed to systematically 
review the incidence, prevalence and nature of injuries in padel.
METHOD: A literature search was performed up to December 2022 through MEDLINE 
Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane Library, SportsDiscus and CINAHL. Following database 
search, article retrieval and title and abstract screening, articles were 
assessed for eligibility against predefined criteria. Studies were assessed for 
methodological quality. Data on injuries' prevalence, incidence and nature of 
injuries were extracted, analysed and described in a descriptive statistical 
manner which did not include a pooling strategy as part of a formal 
meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Eight studies with 2022 participants were included (range of mean age: 
31-57). The incidence rate was 3 injuries per 1000 hours of padel training and 8 
injuries per 1000 matches of padel practice. The overall prevalence range was 
40%-95%. The elbow was the most common anatomical site of injury, followed by 
the knee, shoulder and lower back. Tendinous and muscular injuries were the most 
reported injury types.
CONCLUSION: Injuries are common among padel players, with an incidence rate of 3 
per 1000 hours of padel training and 8 per 1000 matches of padel practice-as 
based on limited literature. The overall prevalence range was 40%-95%. The elbow 
was the most frequently reported anatomical region concerning location injury 
distribution, and injuries were mainly of tendinous or muscular origin.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which is 
expected to solve the diagnostic difficulties of patients with medically 
unexplained symptoms. Based on the previous work, this review aims to 
comprehensively synthesise updated evidence related to SSD from recent years in 
English publications and, more extensively, from data published in Chinese 
language journals. The scoping review update was based on an earlier scoping 
review and included Chinese language publication data from China National 
Knowledge Internet (CNKI), WANFANG and WEIPU between January 2013 and May 2022 
and data from PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library between June 2020 and May 
2022. Initially, 2 984 articles were identified, of which 63 full texts were 
included for analysis. In China, SSD is mainly applied in scientific research, 
but it also shows good predictive validity and clinical application potential. 
The mean frequency of SSD was 4.5% in the general population, 25.2% in the 
primary care population and 33.5% in diverse specialised care settings. 
Biological factors, such as brain region changes and heart rate variability, are 
associated with the onset of SSD. Psychological impairment related to somatic 
symptoms is the best predictor of prognosis. While adolescent SSD was 
significantly associated with family function, SSD overall is associated with an 
increased dysfunction of cognition and emotion, decreased quality of life, and 
high comorbidity with anxiety and depressive disorders. Further research is 
needed on suicide risk and cultural and gender-related issues. Updating the data 
of Chinese language studies, our research enriches the evidence-based findings 
related to the topics addressed in the text sections of the SSD chapter of 
DSM-5. However, research gaps remain about SSD reliability, population-based 
prevalence, suicide risk, and cultural and gender-related issues.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Due to the inaccuracy of the traditional geographical distance-based 
definition of left-behind status, data on the negative effect of left-behind 
status on cognitive function among older adults are controversial.
AIMS: This study examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of 
left-behind status with cognitive function in older Chinese adults. The 
left-behind status definition was based on the frequency of face-to-face 
parent-child meetings.
METHODS: Data from a nationally representative sample of 8 682 older adults (60+ 
years) in 2015 (5 658 left behind and 3 024 non-left behind), of which 6 933 
completed the follow-up in 2018, were obtained from the China Health and 
Retirement Longitudinal Study. Left-behind older adults were broadly defined as 
those aged 60+ years who had living adult children and saw their children less 
than once per month. The cognitive function was assessed with a composite 
cognitive test with higher total scores indicating better cognitive function.
RESULTS: Left-behind older adults had significantly lower cognitive test scores 
than non-left-behind older adults in both 2015 (11.1 (6.0) vs 13.2 (5.9), 
t=15.863, p<0.001) and 2018 (10.0 (6.6) vs 12.4 (6.7), t=14.177, p<0.001). After 
adjusting for demographic factors, lifestyle factors, chronic medical conditions 
and the baseline cognitive test score (in the longitudinal analysis only), on 
average, the cognitive test score of left-behind older adults was 0.628 lower 
than their non-left-behind counterparts in 2015 (t=5.689, p<0.001). This 
difference in cognitive test scores attenuated to 0.322 but remained significant 
in 2018 (t=2.733, p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Left-behind older Chinese adults have a higher risk of poor 
cognitive function and cognitive decline than their non-left-behind 
counterparts. Specific efforts targeting left-behind older adults, such as 
encouraging adult children to visit their parents more regularly, are warranted 
to maintain or delay the progression of cognitive decline.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

(DID) to improve the resource allocation efficiency of medical and health 
financial expenditure to better guarantee the health level of enterprise 
employees. The DEA method is utilized to measure the comprehensive technology, 
pure technology, and scale as the resource allocation efficiency values of urban 
medical and health financial expenditure.
METHODS: The proposed method includes the use of DEA to measure the resource 
allocation efficiency values of urban medical and health financial expenditure. 
The benchmark regression model and DID model are used to analyze the impact 
effect, robustness, and parallel trend of the policy.
RESULTS: The study shows that the proposed method effectively evaluates and 
analyzes the impact of medical comprehensive reform on the resource allocation 
efficiency of urban medical and health financial expenditure. The comprehensive 
medical reform can improve the comprehensive efficiency and scale efficiency of 
urban medical and health financial expenditure, leading to improved resource 
allocation efficiency of urban employees' medical and health financial 
expenditure. The results also indicate a significant positive effect on the time 
trend, which can have a long-term impact and effectiveness.
DISCUSSION: The proposed method can provide useful insights into the resource 
allocation efficiency of medical and health financial expenditure, which can 
help improve the health level of enterprise employees. The study suggests that 
comprehensive medical reform can be an effective way to improve resource 
allocation efficiency and guarantee the health of employees in urban areas.

social problems worldwide. Past studies have proposed that some links exist 
between sunlight and mental health; however, relevant studies examining low-dose 
sunlight exposure populations are lacking. We conducted a study among a group of 
operating room nurses (ORNs) who work long hours in operating rooms and have 
limited sunlight exposure. We aim to add to and refine previous researches on 
the association between mental health and sunlight exposure in community 
population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 787 ORNs were interviewed and analyzed. Mental 
health, sunlight exposure duration, sociodemographic and work-related variables, 
and chronic diseases were evaluated. The Kessler 10 scale (K10) was used to 
assess participants' mental health status, and their sunlight exposure duration 
was assessed using their self-reports. Multiple linear regression analysis was 
adopted to examine the association between sunlight exposure and mental health.
RESULTS: The average K10 score of ORNs was 25.41. ORNs exhibit poorer mental 
health than other populations. Poor mental health was negatively associated with 
greater sunlight exposure hours per day (β=-0.378) and sleep regularity 
(β=-3.341). Poor mental health was positively associated with chronic disease 
(β=3.514).
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the positive association between sunlight 
exposure and mental health existed. Appropriate enhancement of sunlight exposure 
will be beneficial to mental health. Hospitals, related organizations and 
individuals should pay greater attention to ORNs' mental health and sunlight 
exposure conditions. More policy recommendations as well as building structure 
recommendations should be proposed.",© 2023 Wang et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/RMHP.S420018

larger than the effect of domestic lockdown shocks. The results are robust with 
respect to alternative country weights used to construct foreign shocks, i.e.

This case report describes a 20-year-old female with L5-S1 recurrent disc 
herniation and lumbar degeneration. She underwent an L5-S1 ALIF complicated by 
post-operative lower left extremity paralysis. Revision surgery with downsizing 
of the ALIF cage was performed with normal neuromonitoring throughout the 
procedure. The patient displayed persistent post-operative neurologic deficits 
despite no evidence of central or foraminal compression. Patient was later 
diagnosed with conversion disorder by neurology during her hospitalization. This 
case report presents the initial diagnosis of conversion disorder after a 
routine ALIF procedure, which led to surgical re-exploration and prolonged 
inpatient hospital stay. Psychiatric diagnoses must be considered when 
neurologic deficits are present with no apparent organic cause.","Published by Oxford University Press and JSCR Publishing Ltd. © The Author(s)

presentation of pancreatic heterotopia of the gallbladder can vary from biliary 
colic, biliary obstruction or it can be completely asymptomatic. It has been 
suggested that gallbladder pancreatic heterotopia may lead to pancreatitis of

(3)Promotion of Emerging and Evaluative Research Society, London, UK.","BACKGROUND: Large language models such as ChatGPT have demonstrated potential as 
innovative tools for medical education and practice, with studies showing their 
ability to perform at or near the passing threshold in general medical 
examinations and standardised admission tests. However, no studies have assessed 
their performance in the UK medical education context, particularly at a 
specialty level, and specifically in the field of neurology and neuroscience.
METHODS: We evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in higher specialty training 
for neurology and neuroscience using 69 questions from the Pool-Specialty 
Certificate Examination (SCE) Neurology Web Questions bank. The dataset 
primarily focused on neurology (80%). The questions spanned subtopics such as 
symptoms and signs, diagnosis, interpretation and management with some questions 
addressing specific patient populations. The performance of ChatGPT 3.5 Legacy, 
ChatGPT 3.5 Default and ChatGPT-4 models was evaluated and compared.
RESULTS: ChatGPT 3.5 Legacy and ChatGPT 3.5 Default displayed overall accuracies 
of 42% and 57%, respectively, falling short of the passing threshold of 58% for 
the 2022 SCE neurology examination. ChatGPT-4, on the other hand, achieved the 
highest accuracy of 64%, surpassing the passing threshold and outperforming its 
predecessors across disciplines and subtopics.
CONCLUSIONS: The advancements in ChatGPT-4's performance compared with its 
predecessors demonstrate the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) models 
in specialised medical education and practice. However, our findings also 
highlight the need for ongoing development and collaboration between AI 
developers and medical experts to ensure the models' relevance and reliability 
in the rapidly evolving field of medicine.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

(1)Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Helsinki University Central Hospital, 
Espoo, Finland.
(2)Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University 
School of Science, Espoo, Finland.","BACKGROUND: Muscle membranes have a sensation of pain, but within the muscle 
tissue, the origin of pain is unclear. We present a hypothesis that the pain 
receptors of the muscle tissue are situated principally in the muscle spindles. 
A recent report reintroduced that 'end plate spikes' in needle electromyography 
(EMG) are fusimotor unit potentials of the intrafusal muscle fibres, and thus 
represent a marker of muscle spindles.
METHODS: We studied four relaxed muscles with 50 EMG needle insertions in each 
and mapped the appearance of pain and spontaneous EMG activity.
RESULTS: Only 4.0% of the needle insertions in muscle tissue elicited pain. 
However, needle insertions in local active points showing 'end plate spikes' 
and, thus, fusimotor unit potentials of the muscle spindles elicited pain in 86% 
of the insertions, whereas needle insertions in points without 'end plate 
spikes' elicited pain in only 1.0% of the insertions (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Muscle spindles have pain receptors. The extrafusal muscle tissue 
is practically pain-free for the needle insertions. This demonstrates a scarcity 
of extrafusal pain receptors. How this observation is put into perspective with 
the muscle pain syndromes was discussed.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No

not improve functional outcome in the tranexamic acid for hyperacute spontaneous 
intracerebral haemorrhage-2 (TICH-2) trial. In a predefined subgroup, there was 
a statistically significant interaction between prerandomisation baseline 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the effect of tranexamic acid on functional 
outcome (p=0.019).
METHODS: TICH-2 was an international prospective double-blind placebo-controlled 
randomised trial evaluating intravenous tranexamic acid in patients with acute 
spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Prerandomisation baseline SBP was 
split into predefined ≤170 and >170 mm Hg groups. The primary outcome at day 90 
was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a measure of dependency, analysed using 
ordinal logistic regression. Haematoma expansion was defined as an increase in 
haematoma volume of >33% or >6 mL from baseline to 24 hours. Data are OR or 
common OR (cOR) with 95% CIs, with significance at p<0.05.
RESULTS: Of 2325 participants in TICH-2, 1152 had baseline SBP≤170 mm Hg and 
were older, had larger lobar haematomas and were randomised later than 1173 with 
baseline SBP>170 mm Hg. Tranexamic acid was associated with a favourable shift 
in mRS at day 90 in those with baseline SBP≤170 mm Hg (cOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 
0.91, p=0.005), but not in those with baseline SBP>170 mm Hg (cOR 1.05, 95% CI 
0.85 to 1.30, p=0.63). In those with baseline SBP≤170 mm Hg, tranexamic acid 
reduced haematoma expansion (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.82, p=0.001), but not in 
those with baseline SBP>170 mm Hg (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.35, p=0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Tranexamic acid was associated with improved clinical and 
radiological outcomes in ICH patients with baseline SBP≤170 mm Hg. Further 
research is needed to establish whether certain subgroups may benefit from 
tranexamic acid in acute ICH.

pronounced for people enjoying high income and mobility, but tend to be evident 
for urban residents and those having dependents. Notably, self-employed people 
have the highest risk of losing income, while part-time urban workers face the 
highest probability of losing their jobs. The propensity score matching method 
also demonstrates that these losses are most evident for the regions susceptible

on virulence screening and in vitro quantification of toxoflavin, the BG strains 
were classified as hyper- (BG1 and BG3), moderate- (BG2, BG4, BG6, BG8, and

similarity to B. glumae BGR1 except toxB, whereas in toxFGHIJ cluster toxF, 
toxG, toxH and toxI shared maximum similarity to B. glumae 336gr-1. tox genes of 
BG1 exhibited homology as well as divergence with B. gladioli. The domain 
prediction and protein association network analysis indicated the possible 
involvement of tox genes in the toxoflavin biosynthesis. As per our knowledge, 
this is the first report in India on characterization of tox genes cluster in B. 
glumae. Altogether, our study unravels a reliable method for identifying and 
characterizing B. glumae using tox genes and its relationship with disease

the past decade; however, the public health restrictions associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic have led to a sharp increase in social media use in a short 
period of time. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 
social media use on university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifteen 
students from a mid-sized Canadian city were interviewed to share their 
experiences with social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purposive sampling 
was conducted to gather a diverse sample of participants, including individuals 
of various ages, gender and sexual identities, and ethnicities. Thematic 
analysis on the 15 interviews was completed using NVivo (version 12). 
Participants experienced both advantages and disadvantages associated with 
social media use. Ease of communication and stress relief were acknowledged as 
the strongest benefits. Social comparison, loneliness, development of bad 
habits, and lack of focus were cited as major disadvantages to social media use 
during the pandemic. Cost-benefit analysis of social media was common, and 
participants expressed the importance of using social media with moderation, 
balance, and awareness. Our study indicates that the focus on health with 
respect to the pandemic should not be solely based on physical health, rather 
the potential mental health risks associated with social media use during the 
pandemic should be recognized and addressed by healthcare providers.",© The Author(s) 2023.,"DOI: 10.1177/20563051231177970

trustworthy in their handling of a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. There is, 
however, little knowledge about how the affordances and dynamics of social media 
influence perceptions of trustworthiness, especially during a protracted crisis. 
In this article, we study how Twitter users were discussing the trustworthiness 
of the Norwegian health authorities and political leadership throughout three 
periods of partial lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across all the 
periods, there was a substantial number of positive comments, but these were 
outweighed by negative ones. Ability was clearly the most discussed factor for 
trustworthiness, and many users offered up their lay expertise. Discussions of 
integrity and benevolence were less frequent and mostly negative when they 
occurred. An increase in negative comments during the last period might be read 
as an expression of fatigue, and there was a noted dissatisfaction with the 
ability of the political leadership. Taken together, the study suggests Twitter 
to be an arena where users are exposed to arguments and counterarguments in 
negotiations over ability in particular. Such discussions can intensify as a 
crisis drags on and are important to grasp for health authorities and political 
leadership alike. Thus, the study sheds light on the contribution that a 
socio-technical platform like Twitter makes to the discursive formation of 
trustworthiness over time, which in turn might function to strengthen or erode 
public trust in public authorities and political leadership.",© The Author(s) 2023.,"DOI: 10.1177/20563051231179689

University, Nanning, Guangxi, People's Republic of China.","PURPOSE: Disturbance of consciousness is common in patients with severe 
anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. However, little is 
known about it. This study aimed to analyze the clinical manifestations and 
prognostic factors of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with disturbance of consciousness.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical features, treatment results, 
and long-term outcomes of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients with disturbance of 
consciousness were analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to 
analyze the factors affecting their prognosis.
RESULTS: In the group with disturbance of consciousness, the incidences of 
seizures, involuntary movements, pulmonary infection, mechanical ventilation, 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), abnormal 
cerebrospinal fluid index, plasma exchange, and immunosuppressive therapy were 
higher than those in the group without disturbance of consciousness (all 
P<0.05). During the follow-up period (median: 36 months, range: 12-78 months), 
the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score, the maximum mRS score during 
hospitalization, the mRS score at discharge, and the mRS score at 12 months 
after discharge were higher in the disturbance of consciousness group (all P < 
0.001). However, there was no significant difference in long-term outcomes and 
recurrence between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
showed that mechanical ventilation, elevated IgG index, and delayed 
immunotherapy were independent risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with 
anti-NMDAR encephalitis with disturbance of consciousness at 12 months (odds 
ratio: 22.591, 39.868, 1.195). The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) 
curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of mechanical 
ventilation, elevated IgG index, and delayed immunotherapy was 0.971 (95% 
CI=0.934-1.000, P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Mechanical ventilation, elevated IgG index, and delayed 
immunotherapy may be the influencing factors of poor prognosis of anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis patients with disturbance of consciousness. Although their 
condition is relatively serious, most patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis with 
disturbance of consciousness will achieve favorable long-term outcomes after 
long-term treatment.",© 2023 Gong et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/PROM.S411260

little information on this phenomenon among patients with relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS), one of the most common causes of disability and loss 
of autonomy in young adults. The aim of this study was to assess state 
hopelessness and its associated factors in early-stage RRMS.
METHODS: A multicenter, non-interventional study was conducted. Adult patients 
with a diagnosis of RRMS, a disease duration ≤ 3 years, and an Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-5.5 were included. The State-Trait 
Hopelessness Scale (STHS) was used to measure patients´ hopelessness. A battery 
of patient-reported and clinician-rated measurements was used to assess clinical 
status. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine 
the association between patients' characteristics and state hopelessness.
RESULTS: A total of 189 patients were included. Mean age (standard deviation-SD) 
was 36.1 (9.4) years and 71.4% were female. Median disease duration 
(interquartile range-IQR) was 1.4 (0.7, 2.1) years. Symptom severity and 
disability were low with a median EDSS (IQR) score of 1.0 (0, 2.0). A proportion 
of 65.6% (n=124) of patients reported moderate-to-severe hopelessness. 
Hopelessness was associated with older age (p=0.035), depressive symptoms 
(p=<0.001), a threatening illness perception (p=0.001), and psychological and 
cognitive barriers to workplace performance (p=0.029) in the multivariate 
analysis after adjustment for confounders.
CONCLUSION: Hopelessness was a common phenomenon in early-stage RRMS, even in a 
population with low physical disability. Identifying factors associated with 
hopelessness may be critical for implementing preventive strategies helping 
patients to adapt to the new situation and cope with the disease in the long 
term.",© 2023 Sainz de la Maza et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/PPA.S411069

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease with unclear 
etiology and a poor prognosis. Although the involvement of neutrophils in IPF 
pathogenesis has been suggested, the exact nature of this relationship remains 
unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) using immune 
infiltration analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and 
consensus cluster analysis. Neutrophil-related genes and hub genes related to 
neutrophils were identified and differentially expressed between IPF patients 
and healthy controls. We also validated the expression differences of hub genes 
in a bleomycin-induced mice model.
RESULTS: Immune infiltration analysis revealed a significantly decreased 
percentage of neutrophils in the lung tissue of IPF patients compared with 
healthy controls (P<0.001) in both the train and validation sets. 
Neutrophil-related genes in IPF were identified by WGCNA, and functional 
enrichment analysis showed that these genes were mainly involved in the 
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and correlated with lung disease, 
consistent with DEGs between IPF and healthy controls. Eight hub genes related 
to neutrophils were identified, including MMP16, ARG1, IL1R2, PROK2, MS4A2, PIR, 
and ZNF436. Consensus cluster analysis revealed a low neutrophil-infiltrating 
cluster that was correlated with IPF (P<0.001), and a principal component 
analysis-generated score could distinguish IPF patients from healthy controls, 
with an area under the curve of 0.930 in the train set and 0.768 in the 
validation set. We also constructed a diagnostic model using hub genes related 
to neutrophils, which showed a reliable diagnostic value with an area under the 
curve of 0.955 in the train set and 0.995 in the validation set.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of a low neutrophil-infiltrating 
characteristic in the IPF microenvironment and identify hub genes related to 
neutrophils that may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for the disease.",© 2023 Lin et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/JIR.S414734

characterised by enhanced innate and adaptive immunity. Ps and leprosy rarely 
coexist. The molecular immune mechanism of the Ps and leprosy rarely coexistence 
is unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 20 patients with 
Ps, 5 adults with lepromatous leprosy (L-lep), and 5 patients with tuberculoid 
leprosy (T-lep) to analyse the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
them. Moreover, the biological mechanism of Ps and leprosy was explored by Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, 
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
analyses. Finally, 13 DEGs of 10 skin biopsies of Ps patients, 6 samples of 
L-lep patients, 6 samples of T-lep patients and 5 healthy controls were 
confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
RESULTS: The PPI network was constructed and primarily associated with immune 
response, IL-17 signalling, and Toll-like receptor pathway between Ps and 
leprosy. Th17 markers (interleukin (IL)-19, IL-20, IL-36A, IL-36G, IL-22, 
IL-17A, and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) had higher expression in Ps than in L-lep and 
T-lep, whereas macrophage biomarkers (CLEC4E and TREM2), SPP1, and dendritic 
cell (DC)-related hallmarks (ITGAX) and TNF-a had significantly lower expression 
across Ps and T-lep than in L-lep.
CONCLUSION: To put it simply, Ps patients with IL-17A, IL-19, IL-20, IL-36A, 
IL-36G, and IL-22 in conjunction with LCN2 with up-graduated expression might be 
not susceptible to L-lep. However, high levels of CLEC4E, TREM2, and SPP1 in 
L-lep patients indicated that they unlikely suffered from Ps.",© 2023 Ge et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/JIR.S407650

the continuity of operations in a supply chain as suppliers' and their suppliers 
stop producing due the spread of infection, leading to a degradation of 
downstream customer service levels in a ripple effect. In this paper, we 
contextualize a dynamic approach and propose an optimal control model for supply 
chain reconfiguration and ripple effect analysis integrated with an epidemic 
dynamics model. We provide supply chain managers with the optimal choice over a 
planning horizon among subsets of interchangeable suppliers and corresponding 
orders; this will maximize demand satisfaction given their prices, lead times, 
exposure to infection, and upstream suppliers' risk exposure. Numerical 
illustrations show that our prescriptive forward-looking model can help 
reconfigure a supply chain and mitigate the ripple effect due to reduced 
production because of suppliers' infected workers. A risk aversion factor 
incorporates a measure of supplier risk exposure at the upstream echelons. We 
examine three scenarios: (a) infection limits the capacity of suppliers, (b) the 
pandemic recedes but not at the same pace for all suppliers, and (c) infection 
waves affect the capacity of some suppliers, while others are in a recovery 
phase. We illustrate through a case study how our model can be immediately 
deployed in manufacturing or retail supply chains since the data are readily 
accessible from suppliers and health authorities. This work opens new avenues 
for prescriptive models in operations management and the study of viable supply

(DBPs) has increased due to the intensive, large-scale use of disinfectants. 
Halogenated benzoquinones (HBQs) are among the most toxic DBPs, but there is no 
rapid, convenient, and economical detection method. In this study, a novel 
PDIL/BDD-modified electrode was prepared in a mixed solvent of dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile (ACN) by electrochemical polymerization with a 
di-ionic ionic liquid containing alkenyl groups as the monomer. The 
electrochemical behavior of tetra-chloro-p-benzoquinone (TCBQ) on the modified 
electrode was studied. By studying the cyclic voltammetry behavior of TCBQ on 
the PDIL/BDD electrode, it was concluded that the electrode reactions of TCBQ 
included the reduction of TCBQ to TCBQH2 (C1) and the reduction of 
bis-quinhydrone imidazole π-π type charge transfer complex to TCBQH2 (C2). By 
studying the SWV responses of TCBQ in the concentration range of 1-100 ng/L on 
the PDIL/BDD electrode, it was found that the reduction peak current (Ipa) had a 
linear relationship with the concentration. The electrochemical SWV technique 
was used to detect the concentration of trace TCBQ in water and is expected to 
be used for the detection of other HBQs in drinking water and swimming pool 
water.",© 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2023.122242

(qSOFA) and CRB-65 (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure and age 
(≥65 years)) risk scores have not been widely evaluated in patients with 
SARS-CoV-2-positive compared to SARS-CoV-2-negative community-acquired pneumonia 
(CAP). The aim of the present study was to validate the qSOFA(-65) and CRB-65 
scores in a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative CAP 
patients.
METHODS: We included all cases with CAP hospitalised in 2020 from the German 
nationwide mandatory quality assurance programme and compared cases with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection to cases without. We excluded cases with unclear SARS-CoV-2 
infection state, transferred to another hospital or on mechanical ventilation 
during admission. Predefined outcomes were hospital mortality and need for 
mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: Among 68 594 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, hospital mortality (22.7%) 
and mechanical ventilation (14.9%) were significantly higher when compared to 
167 880 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (15.7% and 9.2%, respectively). All CRB-65 
and qSOFA criteria were associated with both outcomes, and age dominated 
mortality prediction in SARS-CoV-2 (risk ratio >9). Scores including the age 
criterion had higher area under the curve (AUCs) for mortality in 
SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (e.g. CRB-65 AUC 0.76) compared to SARS-CoV-2 
negative patients (AUC 0.68), and negative predictive value was highest for 
qSOFA-65=0 (98.2%). Sensitivity for mechanical ventilation prediction was poor 
with all scores (AUCs 0.59-0.62), and negative predictive values were 
insufficient (qSOFA-65=0 missed 1490 out of 10 198 patients (∼15%) with 
mechanical ventilation). Results were similar when excluding frail and 
palliative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation rates were higher in 
SARS-CoV-2-positive than SARS-CoV-2-negative CAP. For SARS-CoV-2-positive CAP, 
the CRB-65 and qSOFA-65 scores showed adequate prediction of mortality but not 
of mechanical ventilation.",Copyright ©The authors 2023.,"DOI: 10.1183/23120541.00168-2023

2019 (COVID-19) illness. However, the mechanisms underlying dyspnoea in the 
post-COVID-19 syndrome remain unclear. The aim of our study was to examine 
dyspnoea quality and intensity, burden of mental health symptoms, and 
differences in exercise responses in people with and without persistent dyspnoea 
following COVID-19.
METHODS: 49 participants with mild-to-critical COVID-19 were included in this 
cross-sectional study 4 months after acute illness. Between-group comparisons 
were made in those with and without persistent dyspnoea (defined as modified 
Medical Research Council dyspnoea score ≥1). Participants completed standardised 
dyspnoea and mental health symptom questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, and 
incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
RESULTS: Exertional dyspnoea intensity and unpleasantness were increased in the 
dyspnoea group. The dyspnoea group described dyspnoea qualities of suffocating 
and tightness at peak exercise (p<0.05). Ventilatory equivalent for carbon 
dioxide (V'E/V'CO2) nadir was higher (32±5 versus 28±3, p<0.001) and anaerobic 
threshold was lower (41±12 versus 49±11% predicted maximum oxygen uptake, 
p=0.04) in the dyspnoea group, indicating ventilatory inefficiency and 
deconditioning in this group. The dyspnoea group experienced greater symptoms of 
anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress (all p<0.05). A subset of 
participants demonstrated gas-exchange and breathing pattern abnormalities 
suggestive of dysfunctional breathing.
CONCLUSIONS: People with persistent dyspnoea following COVID-19 experience a 
specific dyspnoea quality phenotype. Dyspnoea post-COVID-19 is related to 
abnormal pulmonary gas exchange and deconditioning and is linked to increased 
symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.",Copyright ©The authors 2023.,"DOI: 10.1183/23120541.00606-2022

cancer (MIBC) is reported. This study aims to assess the awareness about the 
role of RT in different MIBC settings and see whether this has increased since 
2017.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the bladder cancer guidelines of the EAU, 
ESMO, NCCN, NICE, and AUA/ASCO/ASTRO/SUO, focusing on the role of RT in MIBC. In 
2017, we evaluated the use of RT in MIBC in Belgium. This raised awareness about 
the indications of RT in different MIBC settings. Here, we present a 
retrospective pattern of care analysis of the RT use for MIBC patients at our 
center from January 2012 until December 2021. Frequency of RT use, patient, 
disease and treatment characteristics were compared between two 5-year periods 
(2012-2016 and 2017-2021).
RESULTS: Review of the guidelines suggested that RT can be used as a treatment 
option in most MIBC settings. However, differences between guideline 
recommendations existed and high-level evidence was often lacking. Overall, 221 
unique MIBC patients received RT at our center. RT use for MIBC was 39% higher 
in the second 5-year period (Between the same periods, the number of new MIBC 
registrations increased with 26%). The most pronounced increase, ie, 529%, was 
observed in the primary setting and was in parallel with patient preference 
becoming the main indication for RT. Participation in clinical trials seems to 
have had an important impact on the frequency of RT use in the adjuvant and 
metastatic setting.
CONCLUSION: We provide a critical overview of the RT indications in MIBC as 
recommended by the international guidelines. Increased awareness about RT as a 
treatment option in MIBC seems to have an impact on the treatment choice in 
clinical practice, as was observed in our tertiary center.",© 2023 Verghote et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S407031

anisocytosis that increases with platelet activation. The clinical implications 
of PDW in HCC are not well-defined. This study aimed to determine whether PDW 
could predict recurrence in patients with HCC after resection.
METHODS: Between January and December 2008, 471 patients with HCC were recruited 
retrospectively. The clinicopathological characteristics of patients with HCC 
were analyzed based on the relationship between the two PDW groups. Kaplan-Meier 
curves and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the 
relationship between PDW and disease-free survival (DFS). A novel nomogram was 
developed based on the identified independent risk factors. Its accuracy was 
evaluated using a calibration curve and concordance index. The predictive value 
was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: PDW was significantly associated with direct bilirubin, total 
bilirubin, urea, and prothrombin time. Patients with PDW ≥ 17.1 were a 
significantly shorter DFS than those with PDW < 17.1 (17.98% vs 49.83%, p< 
0.001). Multivariate analysis determined that alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), 
carcinoembryonic antigen, microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor size, and tumor 
number were the independent variables associated with DFS. Patients with PDW ≥ 
17.1 had a hazard ratio of 1.381 (95% confidence interval: 1.069-1.783, p = 
0.014) for DFS. AFP, PDW, MVI, tumor size, and tumor number were identified as 
preoperative independent risk factors for DFS and used to establish the 
nomogram. Calibration curve analysis revealed that the standard curve fitted 
well with the predicted curve. ROC curve analysis demonstrated the high 
efficiency of the nomogram.
CONCLUSION: Increased PDW may predict recurrence-free survival in patients with 
HCC. Our nomogram model also performed well in predicting patient prognoses.",© 2023 Li et al.,"DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S408548

may ultimately produce reproductive isolation in plants. We also overview 
reproductive strategies that might influence sexual selection in plants and

microevolution) with evolution above the species level (macroevolution). We also 
identify outstanding questions in the field, and suitable data and tools for

influence on adolescents' health-related behaviors and cognitions is largely 
untested. In this two-study mixed-method project, we first assessed the extent 
of (non)compliance to COVID-19 regulations by vloggers on YouTube and how 
viewers reacted to this. Second, we experimentally assessed the effects of 
vlogger behavior paired with viewer evaluations on adolescents' COVID-19-related 
attitudes, intentions, and behavior.
METHODS: For Study 1, we coded 240 vlogs of eight popular Dutch vloggers on 
YouTube recorded in the period of February 2020-March 2021. For our 2 × 2 
between-subjects experiment in Study 2, Dutch adolescents (N = 285, Mage 
 = 12.99, SD = 1.02, 41.8% girls) were randomly assigned to conditions in which 
they saw vlogs showing either compliance or noncompliance to COVID-19 
regulations, and to conditions in which they saw either supportive or dismissive 
comments under these vlogs.
RESULTS: Study 1: Vloggers' noncompliance with COVID-19 regulations was not 
uncommon and received relatively more viewer support than compliance, suggesting 
that portrayed noncompliance may be potentially influential. Study 2: 
Adolescents were more worried about COVID-19 after they watched a compliant (vs. 
noncompliant) vlogger. Also, vlogger noncompliance decreased adolescents' 
perceived importance of COVID-19 regulations and rule-setting for adolescents 
who identified strongly with the vloggers they watched.
CONCLUSIONS: Vloggers' (non)compliance affects adolescents' COVID-19-related 
worrying, and attitudes and behavior of adolescents who identify with vloggers 
strongly. This seems concerning given the sometimes harmful and risky behaviors 
vloggers portray online but could potentially also be employed to encourage 
healthy behaviors.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Adolescence published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on

their excellent cycling performance and rate capability compared to silicon (Si) 
anodes. However, SiOx anodes suffer from high volume expansion similar to Si 
anodes, which has been a challenge in developing suitable commercial binders. In 
this study, a water-soluble polyamide acid (WS-PAA) binder with ionic bonds was 
synthesized. The amide bonds inherent in the WS-PAA binder form a stable 
hydrogen bond with the SiOx anode and provide sufficient mechanical strength for 
the prepared electrodes. In addition, the ionic bonds introduced by 
triethylamine (TEA) induce water solubility and new Li+ transport channels to 
the binder, achieving enhanced electrochemical properties for the resulting SiOx 
electrodes, such as cycling and rate capability. The SiOx anode with the WS-PAA 
binder exhibited a high initial capacity of 1004.7 mAh·g-1 at a current density 
of 0.8 A·g-1 and a capacity retention of 84.9% after 200 cycles. Therefore,

personal safety, whereas existing materials suffer from indefinite protective 
effects and stimulus response at subzero temperatures in the long term. Herein, 
an anti-freezing and flexible puncture-resistance composite with strain-sensing 
ability is developed by compounding a NaCl-soaked poly(vinyl alcohol) 
(PVA)/sodium alginate (SA)/glycerol (Gly) hydrogel (PSGN hydrogel) with Kevlar 
fabric. After freezing-thawing treatment once and NaCl immersion for 10 h, the 
Kevlar/PSGN-10 composite has excellent puncture-resistance properties and 
linear, rapid response, wide band, and stable strain-sensing behaviors at 25 and 
-30 °C. The composite's maximum puncturing force and energy dissipation at -30 
°C are 53.92 N and 370 mJ, respectively, increased by 285 and 302% compared with 
neat Kevlar fabric. The flexibility reduction and the mass addition of the 
Kevlar/PSGN-10 composite are merely 19 and 40%, respectively, showing superior 
wearable comfortability and protection efficiency. The composites also reveal 
remarkable strain-sensing abilities at -30 °C (linear strain sensitivity with GF 
= 0.27 and R2 = 0.981, a wide working frequency range of 0.16-1.3 Hz, and 
sensing stability for 1500 cycles). Moreover, the composite could respond to 
multipart body motion directly, including fingers, elbows, wrists, and knees. 
Consequently, the Kevlar/PSGN composite developed in this paper is promising for 
intelligent soft body armor at various temperatures.","DOI: 10.1021/acsami.3c07030

RESULTS: The sensitivity of 6-canal vHIT, caloric test, cVEMP, and oVEMP to 
detect vestibulopathy in VS patients was 51%, 47%, 39%, and 25%, respectively. 
Normal tests were found in 21% of the patients. The results of vHIT and caloric 
test were related to tumor volume, but this was not found for cVEMP and oVEMP.
CONCLUSION: The caloric test and 6-canal vHIT showed the highest sensitivity in 
detecting vestibulopathy in untreated VS patients. vHIT, and particularly the 
posterior canal, was limited with a high prevalence of abnormal results on the 
nontumor side. A combination of cVEMP and caloric test was favorable in terms of 
a relatively high sensitivity and low prevalence of abnormal results on the 
nontumor side. Larger tumors had a higher rate of pathology on caloric testing 
and vHIT.","© 2023 The Authors. Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery published by Wiley

electrocatalysis of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO, while it is still 
a challenge to achieve high current density and high atom efficiency 
simultaneously. Here, we present a new and simple in situ adsorption-reduction 
method to prepare Ag SACs supported on CeO2 (Ag1/CeO2). It is found that Ag 
single atoms are anchored on CeO2 through strong metal-support interaction 
(SMSI), and each Ag atom is accompanied with three interfacial oxygen vacancies. 
This Ag1/CeO2 exhibits high performance in the electrocatalytic CO2RR with a 
high CO faradaic efficiency (FE) of >95% under a wide potential range. The 
turnover frequency (TOF) value can reach 50,310 h-1 at FECO = 99.5% in H-cells. 
Notably, Ag1/CeO2 achieves an industrial-grade current density of 403 mA cm-2 
with a high FECO of 97.2% in flow cells. Experimental results combined with 
density functional theory calculation revealed that this superior performance 
was mainly ascribed to the existence of interfacial oxygen vacancies, which lead 
to the formation of Ag-O-Ce3+ atomic interfaces, and activates the Ce3+-O 
structures as the synergistic active center of Ag, thus promoting CO2 adsorption 
and activation and reducing the reaction potential barrier of *COOH-to-*CO.","DOI: 10.1021/acsami.3c04556

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib, a potent ferroptosis inducer, is used 
to treat advanced HCC but its efficacy is limited by the development of drug 
resistance.
METHODS: The effects of DUXAP8 expression on HCC progression were evaluated by 
TCGA database, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and in situ hybridization analysis. 
Sorafenib resistant HCC cell lines were modeled in vitro to study the regulation 
of DUXAP8 on ferroptosis in HCC induced by sorafenib. We used RNA pull-down, 
immunofluorescence assays, acyl-biotinyl exchange assay and mass spectrometry 
analysis to assess the molecular mechanism of ferroptosis regulation by DUXAP8. 
Syngeneic subcutaneous and orthotopic CDX models were used to assess whether 
DUXAP8 inhibition improves HCC in vivo.
RESULTS: LncRNA DUXAP8, which is highly expressed in liver cancer and associated 
with poor prognosis, contributes to sorafenib resistance through suppression of 
ferroptosis. In vitro tests revealed that DUXAP8 reduced the sensitivity of HCC 
to sorafenib-induced ferroptosis by acting on SLC7A11, a subunit of the amino 
acid antiporter system xc-. DUXAP8 facilitates SLC7A11 palmitoylation and 
impedes its lysosomal degradation, thereby enhancing SLC7A11 action and 
suppressing ferroptosis. RNA pull-down and immunofluorescence assays confirmed 
that DUXAP8 decreased membrane translocation and promoted sorting of 
de-palmitoylated SLC7A11 to lysosomes by binding of DUXAP8 to SLC7A11. In 
addition, mass spectrometric analysis found that the Cys414 residue of SLC7A11 
might be the predominant mutant site responsible for molecular masking of 
SLC7A11 lysosomal sorting. Further, the antitumor effect of DUXAP8 knockdown was 
verified in orthotopic and subcutaneous CDX models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a novel translational strategy combining 
sorafenib with DUXAP8 silencing to overcome drug resistance may improve 
treatment efficacy in patients with advanced HCC.","© 2023 The Authors. Clinical and Translational Medicine published by John Wiley

for Clostridioides difficile infection, it has not been well studied in patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of 
fidaxomicin for the treatment of C. difficile infection in patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective study of adults with inflammatory 
bowel disease and C. difficile infection treated with fidaxomicin with at least 
3 months of follow up. The primary outcomes were treatment response, defined as 
resolution of C. difficile infection-attributed diarrhea and/or negative 
C. difficile infection stool test, and time to C. difficile infection recurrence 
after fidaxomicin.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (median age 42 years; 60.6% female) were 
included. Most patients had ulcerative colitis (26, 78.8%), were receiving 
treatment with a biologic or small molecule medication (19, 57.6%), and had a 
prior episode of C. difficile infection (26, 78.8%, median 2 episodes, range 
0-15). Fidaxomicin led to resolution of C. difficile infection in 20 (60.6%)

CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and

for myocardial infarction. Yet, the mutual interaction of cardiac patches with 
healthy tissue has not been completely understood. Here, we investigated the 
impact of acellular and cellular patches on a healthy cardiac tissue, and the 
effect of the beating of the healthy tissue on the cells encapsulated in the 
patch. We cultured human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes 
(iCMs) on a coverslip representing the healthy tissue and placed gelatin 
methacryloyl hydrogel alone or with encapsulated iCMs to create acellular and 
cellular patches respectively. When the acellular patch was placed on the 
healthy tissue, the beating characteristics and Ca+2 handling properties were 
adversely affected, whereas placing the cellular patch restored these 
characteristics. To better understand the effects of the cyclic contraction and 
relaxation induced by the beating healthy tissue on the patch placed on top of 
it, a simulation model was developed, and the calculated strain values were in 
agreement with the values measured experimentally. Moreover, this dynamic 
culture induced by the healthy beating tissue on the iCMs encapsulated in the 
cellular patch improved their beating characteristics. Additionally, with the 
dynamic culture, maturity related genes were upregulated, whereas fibrosis 
related ones were downregulated. Furthermore, the encapsulated iCMs observed to 
be coupled with the underlying healthy beating tissue. Overall, this study 
provides a detailed investigation on the mutual relationship of 
acellular/cellular patches with healthy beating tissue, understanding of which 
would be valuable for developing more advanced cardiac patches.",Copyright © 2023 by ASME.,"DOI: 10.1115/1.4062736

infarction (MI) in patients undergoing complex versus noncomplex percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: We assessed the risk of periprocedural MI according to the fourth 
Universal definition of myocardial infarction (UDMI) and several other criteria 
among patients undergoing elective PCI in a prospective, single-center registry. 
Complex PCI included at least one of the following: 3 coronary vessels treated, 
≥3 stents implanted, ≥3 lesions treated, bifurcation with 2 stents implanted, 
total stent length >60 mm, treatment of chronic total occlusion, and use of 
rotational atherectomy.
RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2021, we included 1010 patients with chronic coronary 
syndrome, of whom 226 underwent complex PCI (22.4%). The rate of periprocedural 
MI according to the fourth UDMI was significantly higher in complex compared to 
noncomplex PCI patients (26.5% vs. 14.5%, p < 0.001). Additionally, 
periprocedural MI was higher in the complex PCI group using SCAI (4% vs. 1.1%, 
p = 0.009), ARC-2 (13.7% vs. 8.0%, p = 0.013), ISCHEMIA (5.8% vs. 1.7%, 
p = 0.002), and EXCEL criteria (4.9% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.032). SYNTAX periprocedural 
MI occurred at low rates in both groups (0.9% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.657). Complex PCI 
was an independent predictor of the fourth UDMI periprocedural MI (odds ratio 
[OR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-2.27, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic coronary syndrome undergoing elective PCI, 
complex PCI is associated with a significantly higher risk of periprocedural MI 
using multiple definitions. These findings highlight the importance of 
considering upfront this risk in the planning of complex PCI procedures.","© 2023 The Authors. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions published

predictive of cognitive decline in cases of Alzheimer's disease; however, 
multidimensional characteristics of SMC make it difficult to formulate causal 
links. The Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ) has proven 
effective in capturing the nature of SMC. In this study, we developed a revised 
version of SMCQ (SMCQ-R) with corresponding normative data for application in 
Taiwan.
METHODS: This study recruited 100 cognitively normal participants (> 45 years) 
stratified according to demographic characteristics. Assessments were performed 
to evaluate test-retest reliability, criterion-related validity, and construct 
validity of SMCQ-R. SMCQ-R scores of 20 matched patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) were also compared with those of normal participants to test 
construct validity.
RESULTS: Reliability of SMCQ-R was satisfactory (0.81-0.95). Factor analysis 
revealed a three-factor structure: everyday memory problems (EMP), recent severe 
memory problems (RSMP), and long-term memory problems (LTMP). EMP and RSMP 
scores were negatively associated with objective cognitive function (r = -.20 to 
.39). Depressive symptoms were positively associated with all factors 
(r = .23-.33). Age was positively associated with total (b = 0.09, p < .05) and 
EMP scores (b = 0.06, p < .01). MCI patients obtained higher scores (p < .05) on 
all subscales. SMCQ-R scores discriminated between normal and MCI individuals 
(area under the curve = 0.77). This study established a norm based on scores 
adjusted to control for effects of age.
CONCLUSIONS: SMCQ-R has sound psychometric properties and could potentially be 
used as a tool to assess SMC in clinical settings.","© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

be an adjunctive therapy for mitral isthmus (MI) ablation. Additionally, EIVOM 
can widely ablate the epicardium via the branches that extend to the left 
atrial posterior wall (LAPW) and facilitate LAPW isolation. This study aimed to 
investigate the efficacy and durability of LAPW isolation with EIVOM.
METHODS: Our cohort consisted of 413 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who 
underwent both LAPW and MI ablations. EIVOM was first attempted in 177 (35%) 
patients with adequate VOMs. The VOM was infused with 5 mL of ethanol with a 
double coaxial guiding catheter technique. Both ablations were performed only by 
radiofrequency ablation (the RF group) in the remaining 236 (57%) patients.
RESULTS: EIVOM with 5 mL of ethanol was completely achieved in 106 patients (the 
EIVOM group). The application duration of LAPW isolation did not differ 
significantly between the two groups (718 ± 276 vs. 709 ± 288 s; p = .78). LAPW 
debulking ablation was required in 64/106 (60%) and 176/236 (75%) patients in 
the EIVOM and RF groups, respectively (p < .05). However, AF- or atrial 
tachycardia-free survival analyses revealed no significant differences between 
the two groups (log-rank p = .70). Among the cases of recurrence, 17 and 38 
patients underwent subsequent ablation sessions; LAPW was reconnected in 9/17 
(53%) and 25/38 (53%) patients (p = .36) in the EIVOM and RF groups, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: EIVOM reduced the number of cases that required LAPW debulking 
ablation but did not improve the durability of LAPW isolation or clinical 
outcomes.",© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1111/jce.15977

(1)Department of Ultrasound, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical 
University, Beijing, China.","BACKGROUND: Stroke is closely related to carotid atherosclerotic plaques, which 
tend to occur in specific parts of the arteries, especially at the bifurcations, 
and are considered to be caused by biomechanical factors. Quantitative analysis 
of hemodynamic stress characteristics of the carotid sinus in vivo provides a 
mechanical basis for the development of atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid 
sinus. Previous studies found that ultrasound (US) contrast agent microbubbles 
would vibrate nonlinearly under the excitation of sound pressure, generating 
subharmonics (transmission fundamental frequency, i.e., f0 and subharmonic 
frequency at f0 /2), which have the highest sensitivity to pressure changes and 
exhibit an inverse linear relationship with environmental pressure.
PURPOSE: This study employed subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) 
technology to reflect carotid artery hydrodynamic characteristics in the carotid 
lumen.
METHODS: From May 2021 to December 2021, this prospective study reviewed a total 
of 26 normal carotid arteries of 13 participants, all of whom received bilateral 
carotid artery routine US and SHAPE US examinations. During this study, the 
lumen of the bilateral distal segment of the common carotid artery (Distal-CCA), 
carotid artery bifurcation (CAB), and carotid bulb (CB) were scanned section by 
section from bottom to top in longitudinal and transverse sections. 
Subsequently, the subharmonic amplitudes in the lumen of normal carotid arteries 
were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: This study found that the amplitude of subharmonic amplitude in the 
carotid was distributed unevenly, with the amplitudes of subharmonic at the CAB 
being higher. Specifically, the subharmonic gradient of the carotid artery 
bifurcation apex plane was maximum (9.72 ± 4.31 dB), while the average 
subharmonic amplitude of the outer lateral layer of the carotid artery was 
higher (-56.40 ± 6.31 dB) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The SHAPE technique is capable of indirectly reflecting the pressure 
changes of vascular system tissues, which may provide a new monitoring method 
for evaluating mechanical characteristics obviating invasion.",© 2023 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.,"DOI: 10.1002/mp.16542

symptoms of lameness in horses; however, it is associated with adverse effects 
such as gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS). Interestingly, many practitioners 
prescribe omeprazole (OME) concurrently with PBZ to prevent the development of 
EGUS. However, the efficacy and safety of this practice in Mongolian horses with 
chronic lameness remain unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effects of a combination of PBZ and OME on 
chronic lameness in Mongolian horses.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomised block experimental design.
METHODS: Eighteen Mongolian horses with lameness score was ≥3 points, were 
divided into three treatment groups, with six horses in each group: placebo 
(CON), PBZ (4.4 mg/kg PO q. 24 h), or PBZ plus OME (4 mg/kg PO q. 24 h; 
PBZ + OME) in a randomised block design based on the initial lameness score. The 
horses were treated for 15 days. During this period, weekly gastroscopy, and 
physiological and biochemical tests were performed.
RESULTS: Both PBZ (median 1.0, interquartile range [IQR]: 0.8-1.3; p = 0.01) and 
PBZ + OME (median 1.0, IQR: 1.0-1.0; p = 0.01) significantly decreased the 
lameness score compared with before administration. In addition, PBZ 
significantly increased the equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD) score 
(3.0 ± 0.6, p < 0.001), GT-17 content (293.4 ± 21.8 pg/mL, p < 0.001), and 
pepsinogen-1 (PG1) content (295.3 ± 38.3 ng/mL, p < 0.001) compared with CON or 
PBZ + OME. However, it significantly reduced the total protein (53.6 ± 1.5 g/L, 
p < 0.05) and albumin (25.5 ± 1.8 g/L, p < 0.05) contents. Nevertheless, 
compared with PBZ, PBZ + OME significantly decreased the EGGD score (0.3 ± 0.5, 
p < 0.001) and significantly increased the gastric fluid pH (7.3 ± 0.5, 
p < 0.001), total protein content (62.5 ± 4.6 g/L, p = 0.009), and albumin 
content (29.4 ± 1.1 g/L, p = 0.004). Meanwhile, they significantly diminished 
the gastrin 17 (GT-17) (162.0 ± 21.0 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and PG1 
(182.4 ± 22.5 ng/mL, p < 0.001) contents.
MAIN LIMITATIONS: Individual differences in horses were larger, but the sample 
size was small. There was larger interval between observations for each index.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with PBZ alone, PBZ + OME had no therapeutic effect on 
chronic lameness; however, it reduced the occurrence of EGGD in Mongolian 
horses. Horses may be protected against chronic lameness and PBZ-induced EGGD by 
increasing the pH value, decreasing serum PG1 and GT-17 content, and preventing 
the reduction of myeloperoxidase content.",© 2023 EVJ Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/evj.13962

complication, usually caused during dialysis cannulation, which traditionally 
has been treated with open and less frequently endovascular techniques. Thrombin 
injection, although established in the treatment of arterial pseudoaneurysms, 
has barely been used in the treatment of AVF-PSA, due to concerns for AVF 
thrombosis or proximal embolization.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA 2020 
guidelines. PubMed and Cochrane Central databases were reviewed and all clinical 
reports on AVF-PSA balloon assisted percutaneous thrombin injection through July 
2022 were included. The electronic search yielded five case reports. Due to 
between-study differences and small sample size, the findings were summarized 
from each report, but the results were not pooled. Additionally, we present our 
own experience on two patients with AVF-PSA that were treated with balloon 
assisted percutaneous thrombin injection.
RESULTS: A total of five case reports (no of patients: 7, including ours) were 
included for review. Most of the patients were male (n = 6) and the mean age was 
65.9 years. The average size of the PSA was 1.6 cm. In all cases a balloon was 
inflated to prevent thrombin and thrombotic material intrusion into the fistula 
lumen, prior to thrombin injection. In one patient n-butyl cyanoacrylate and 
Lipiodol were used, due to thrombin non availability. Recurrence was reported in 
only one patient, and average follow-up is 16 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Thrombin injection with concomitant balloon inflation seems to be a 
safe and effective treatment for arteriovenous fistula pseudoaneurysms. Future 
studies should be aimed at evaluating the long-term outcomes of such minimally 
invasive techniques.","DOI: 10.1177/11297298231182158

head and neck. As of January 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services requires hospitals to disclose payer-negotiated prices for services, 
offering new insight into prices for privately insured patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis.
SETTING: Turquoise database.
METHODS: Payer-negotiated facility fees for 41 reconstructive surgeries were 
grouped by procedure type: primary closure, skin grafts, tissue rearrangement, 
locoregional flaps, or free flaps. Prices were normalized to account for local 
labor costs, then calculated as percent markup in excess of Medicare 
reimbursement. The mean percent markup between procedure groups was compared by 
the Kruskal-Wallis test. Subset analyses were performed to compare mean percent 
markup using a Student's t test. We also assessed price variation by calculating 
the ratio of 90th/10th percentile mean prices both across and within hospitals.
RESULTS: In total, 1324 hospitals (85% urban, 81% nonprofit, 49% teaching) were 
included. Median payer-negotiated fees showed an increasing trend with more 
complex procedures, ranging from $379.54 (interquartile range [IQR], 
$230.87-$656.96) for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 12001 (""simple

the modulation of PMN-MDSCs on B cells was conducted by coculture assays,

verified through western blot and flow cytometry. PMN-MDSCs accumulated in the 
spleen and joints of CIA mice. PMN-MDSCs depletion could alleviate the arthritis 
severity, which was accompanied by decreased TNF-α secretion and proliferation 
of B cells. And its adoptive transfer also facilitated disease progress. 
Furthermore, PMN-MDSCs from CIA mice had higher expression level of BAFF, which 
regulated TNF-α expression, proliferation and apoptosis of B cells in vitro. 
What's more, BAFF promoted phosphorylation of BTK/NF-κB signalling pathway. And 
Ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) could reverse the effect of BAFF on TNF-α expression

important economic and horticultural crop. In March 2022, melon plants in 
greenhouses exhibited severe leaf yellow spot symptoms in Changjiang County 
(109°13'N, 19°28'E), Hainan Province. The incidence of the disease was about 
30-50%. Lesions initially appeared as yellow dots on leaves and expanded 
irregularly. Gradually, brown spots appeared, and finally the whole leaves 
turned yellow and resulted in blighting and death of foliage (Figure 1.). A 
total of four symptomatic plants were sampled from about 0.2 ha of an area. 
Symptomatic leaves were excised, surface disinfected with 2% (w/v) NaOCl, rinsed 
three times with sterile distilled water, and placed on potato dextrose agar 
(PDA) followed by incubation at 25°C in the dark for 5 days. The pure cultures 
were obtained by the hyphal-tip method. A total of eight fungal isolates with 
similar colony characteristics were recovered from the four symptomatic plants. 
Three DNA fragments (ITS, TEF1, and RPB2) of the eight isolates showed 100% 
sequence identity based on the molecular identification methods described below. 
Therefore, one of the isolates, M2JP-3, was chosen for identification and test 
of the pathogenicity. The colony of M2JP-3 on PDA at 25°C for 5 days was white 
with yellow-brown pigmentation in the center (Figure 2A-B). From 10-day-old 
cultures grown on CLA (Fisher et al. 1982), macroconidia (n = 50) were falcate, 
slender, curved dorsiventrally, tapering towards both ends, 3 to 7 septate, and 
measured 24.5 to 52.1 x 3.7 to 4.7 μm. The microconidia (n = 50) were straight 
or slightly curved, septate 0 to 2, and measured 9.9 to 16.3 x 2.5 to 3.7 μm 
(Figure 2C-E). For molecular identification, genomic DNA was extracted using the 
method previously described (Khan et al. 2021),the internal transcribed spacer 
(ITS), translation elongation factor 1α (TEF1) and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
subunit II (RPB2) were amplified, respectively, using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White 
et al. 1990), EF1/ EF2 (O'Donnell et al. 1998), and 5F2/7cR (Reeb et al. 2004). 
The 529 bp (ITS), 723 bp (TEF1), and 965bp (RPB2) sequences were deposited in 
GenBank with acce. nos. OP303211, OP312675 and OP312674, respectively. A 
phylogenetic tree was constructed using the concatenated three gene sequences of 
M2JP-3 and that of the Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC) (Xia 
et al. 2019) based on Maximum Likelihood (Figure 3). M2JP-3 was grouped together 
with the F. pernambucanum strain NRRL 32864 (accession no. GQ505702 for ITS, 
GQ505613 for TEF1and GQ505791 for RPB2), and shared 100% concatenated sequence 
identity. For pathogenicity tests of M2JP-3, seeds of melon cultivar Jinmeiren 
were surface disinfected and sowed in soil in three replicated pots in a 
greenhouse at 26 °C under natural light. Healthy leaves of the melon plants were 
wounded with needles and inoculated with mycelial plugs of M2JP-3 or PDA plugs 
as control. . Symptoms similar to the original greenhouse symptoms were observed 
at 7 days after inoculation (Figure 4). The control leaves were asymptomatic. 
The same fungus was reisolated from the inoculated leaves, as identified based 
on morphology and molecular evidence, which confirmed the Kochs' postulates. To 
our knowledge, this is the first time Fusarium pernambucanum has been recorded 
causing leaf yellow spot disease on melon. Further, findings of the present 
study will help to develop effective disease management strategies against 
Fusarium pernambucanum Leaf Yellow Spot on melon in China.","DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-03-23-0521-PDN

main apple production areas. We evaluated the effects of temperature, moisture, 
and ultraviolet (UV) light on the germination, infection, and survival of 
teliospore horns and basidiospores under artificially controlled environmental 
conditions. The temperature required for the germination and infection by G. 
yamadae teliospores and basidiospores ranged from 5°C to 25°C, with an optimum 
of approximately 17°C. The teliospore horn germinated when soaking in distilled 
water for 5 min and required at least 2.3 h of development to produce 
basidiospores under the most favorable conditions. Basidiospores could only 
germinate in free water and produced germ tubes 0.8 h after being placed in the 
water. The half-life of the basidiospore was 72.5 h in the dark and only 9.5 h 
when exposed to intense UV light. The basidiospores inoculated on the host 
leaves required at least 2.3 h of water exposure to cause rust lesions. A 
revised Weibull model could describe the relationships between the germination 
and infection of teliospore horns and basidiospores with temperature and wetness 
duration. Collectively, these results can serve as a valuable guide for 
developing a model to predict future apple rust epidemics and establish a method 
for effective control strategies.","DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-11-22-2576-RE

contain abundant nutrients, especially lecithin (Guo et al., 2022). In March 
2021, leaf spot disease was observed on 90% cultivated H. citrina seedlings in 
Dazhou city (31°17'56″ N, 107°31'59″ E), Sichuan, China. Totally, 15 diseased 
seedlings were sampled (three samples per 666 m2). The symptomatic leaves were 
cut into pieces (5 × 3 mm), superficially disinfected with 70% ethanol for 20 s 
and 1% Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) for 40 s, and washed with sterile distilled 
water six times. The disinfected tissues were incubated on PDA amended with 
streptomycin sulfate (50 mg/L) in dark at 25 ℃. Two days later, hyphal tips from 
the edges of growing colonies were transferred to fresh PDA plates. Finally, 40 
purified isolates were obtained. Using primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (Glass & 
Donaldson, 1995), amplified rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions 
indicated that these isolates belonged to different genera, mainly including 
Epicoccum, Fusarium and Colletotrichum. Six isolates of Epicoccum genus similar 
in morphology, named HHC46, HHC47, HHC491, HHC492, HHC51 and HHC58, were 
selected for identification. Cultured on oatmeal agar for 7 days, colonies were 
initially white and villose. Fourteen days later, mycelia started to secrete 
scarlet pigment. The NaOH spot test showed color changed from green to red, 
identical to that in Epicoccum species (Boerema et al., 2004). Meanwhile, 
colonies produced abundant conidia. Conidia were ellipsoidal, aseptate, and 4.1 
to 6.5 × 1.3 to 2.9 µm (n = 30). Chlamydospores were also observed, globose to 
subglobose. The morphological features were similar to those of Epicoccum 
latusicollum (Xu et al., 2022). The DNA sequences of Beta-tubulin (TUB2) and 
DNA-directed RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) of six isolates 
were amplified and sequenced, using primer pairs Bt2a/Bt2b (Glass & Donaldson, 
1995), and RPB2-5f2/RPB2-7cr (O'Donnell et al., 2012), respectively. BLASTN 
searches indicated our ITS (OP107240 - OP107245), TUB2 (OP131865 - OP131870) and 
RPB2 (OP131871 - OP131876) sequences except one TUB2 (OP131867), showed 100% 
identity to the corresponding sequences of E. latusicollum CGMCC:3.18346 
(KY742101, KY742343 and KY742174, respectively). There was a nucleotide 
divergence between OP131867 and reference sequence. Based on concatenated ITS, 
TUB2 and RPB2 sequences, the constructed phylogenetic tree of Epicoccum species, 
confirmed that our isolates were E. latusicollum. To test pathogenicity, 
2-year-old healthy seedlings of cultivar ""chuanhuanghua No.1"" were sprayed with 
conidial suspension of HHC51 (105 conidia/mL), with controls treated with 
sterile distilled water. Each treatment (biological replicates = 3) was 
incubated in a greenhouse (at 25°C under 90% relative humidity, 16/8 h 
light/dark cycle). The experiment was repeated twice. After 18 days, leaf spot 
symptom in inoculated seedlings appeared. Whereas, non-inoculated controls 
showed no symptom. The pathogens were re-isolated from diseased leaves and 
identified as E. latusicollum, based on morphology and molecular methods 
described above. E. sorghinum was previously reported as causal agent of leaf 
spot in H. citrina (Ma et al., 2021). To our knowledge, this is the first report 
of E. latusicollum causing leaf spot in H. citrina worldwide. Our study will 
assist with monitoring disease distribution in H. citrina and host diversity of 
E. latusicollum (Chen et al., 2017).","DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-03-23-0435-PDN

shrubs native to North China, Korea, and Japan. In the U.S., weigela are 
commonly used as landscape ornamental plants (McNamara et al. 2010). Two viruses 
have been reported in weigela: tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus and impatiens 
necrotic spot orthotospovirus (Sastry et al. 2019). Ten weigela plants, 
originating from commercial nurseries in Minnesota, exhibiting chlorosis, 
chlorotic line patterns, and necrosis (e-Xtra) were submitted for virus 
diagnostics as potted plants at the University of Minnesota Plant Disease Clinic 
and the Virology Lab in 2019 and 2020 (five plants each year). Under greenhouse 
conditions, symptoms progressed from chlorosis to necrosis and even plant death 
in two of the five plants in 2019. Electron microscopy revealed rod-shaped 
particles of ≈20 nm in diameter and lengths between 40-200 nm with similar 
morphology to members of the genus Tobravirus (e-Xtra). Virus-like particles 
were enriched by ultracentrifugation and total nucleic acids were extracted from 
partial purifications using a phenol:chloroform extraction method (Lockhart et 
al. 1997). Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) was identified by cloning and sequencing 
of the 463bp amplicon obtained with the TRV detection primers described in 
Robinson, 1992. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) was done to confirm the TRV 
detection. A cDNA library was prepared from purified viral RNA using the TruSeq 
Stranded mRNA kit and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform as 150 
bp-paired end reads. A total of 44,316,446 raw data reads were obtained, 
preprocessed using the BBDuk plugin, and de novo assembled using SPAdes 
assembler. Viral contigs were identified using the NCBI BLASTX tool. The 
assembly of TRV RNA1 was 6,842 nt with 20,627,348 reads (47% of total reads) 
mapped to it and an average coverage per nucleotide at 323,639X. The assembly of 
TRV RNA2 was 3,033 nt with 22,769,253 reads (52% of total reads) mapped to it 
and an average coverage per nucleotide at 798,660X. NCBI GenBank accession 
numbers for the assemblies representing RNA1 and RNA2 are OQ408335 and OQ408336, 
respectively. NCBI BLASTn analysis showed the highest level of nucleotide 
identity to TRV genomic RNA segments 1 and 2, with 97% and 99% identity to the 
TRV isolate RNA1 (GQ903771) and RNA2 (GQ903772), respectively, that originated 
from Michigan potato. No other viral contigs were detected from the virion 
nucleic acid extraction by HTS, however this enrichment method doesn't exclude 
other viruses. In addition to using the detection primers by Robinson 1992, we 
designed primers based on our HTS data: TRV-WG-DetF3 5'- 
GACGAAGGAGGCTGTCATTGC-3' and TRV-WG-DetR3 5'-CGGACTATCGTGATGCCCATGC- 3'. RT-PCR 
amplicons from each of the 10 symptomatic plants were cloned and sequenced. 
Among these clones, Sanger sequence identities ranged between 96-100% compared 
to the HTS data and 98-99% to the TRV potato isolate from MI. To our knowledge, 
this is the first report of TRV infecting the ornamental host W. florida 
worldwide. TRV is a nematode-transmitted viral pathogen of economic importance, 
most notably in potatoes (Sastry et al. 2019). In the US, TRV has been reported 
on several landscape ornamentals, horticultural crops, and native habitats. 
Further research is needed to investigate the impact of TRV on the ornamental 
industry and the role of ornamentals as reservoirs for cultivated crops like 
potatoes.","DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-02-23-0351-PDN

China and commonly used as cut flower. Water soaked lesions on the tuber and 
petiole followed by collapse of entire plant along with foul smell were noticed 
in a 4-hectare calla lily plantation in the Yanqing District of Beijing, China 
during August 2022. It was revealed 20%-30% of the plants had these symptoms. 
Petiole (5 cm) and tuber (5 mm3) samples were collected from 10 plants randomly 
from fields. The samples were disinfected with 75% ethanol for 5 s, and then 
rinsed three times with distilled water (DW). Five small pieces for each 
collected petiole and tuber (about 0.25 cm2 in area) were ground in DW; the 
suspension was plated on Luria Bertani agar and incubated for 12 h at 28°C. 
Single colonies were picked and re-streaked three times to purify the bacterial 
culture. The colonies were creamy, short rod-shaped, gray translucent, and with 
shiny texture. Gram staining revealed red color, confirming it as Gram-negative 
bacteria (Werkman et al. 1932). For molecular analysis, DNA was directly 
extracted from single colony using FastPure Bacteria DNA Isolation Mini Kit 
(Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd. Nanjing, China). Four gene-specific markers (16S rRNA, 
dnaJ, atpD, and ropB) were then amplified using their respective primer pairs 
(Monciardini et al. 2002). The sequences obtained from four strains, namely 
ZAPR22R, ZAPR22L, ZAPR22P and ZAPR22S, were submitted after editing to GenBank 
with accession numbers OP740771.1-OP740774.1 for 16S rRNA, OP759518.1-OP759521.1 
for atpD, OP759514.1-OP759517.1 for dnaJ, and OP759510.1-OP759513.1 for ropB 
genes. All of these gene sequences have the highest BLAST hit to Providencia 
rettgeri with 94.8% to 99.8% sequence identity (expcept dnaJ, 88.3%) and 96% to 
100% of coverage. Phylogenetic tree constructed based on sequences of all four 
genes using RAxML v8.2.12 (github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML) showed that the 
calla lily bacterial strains were clustered with type strain of P. rettgeri). 
Koch's postulate was performed to confirm the pathogenicity of the bacterial 
strain ZAPR22R by inoculating petiole base of 20 seedlings of Zantedeschia cv. 
'Jingcai Yangguang' with the classical injection procedure. Three sites 1-2cm 
above the petiole base of individual plant were injected with 100 µl of 108 
CFU/ml bacteria, and each was spaced 1 cm apart. All samples were incubated with 
16 h of light and 8 h of darkness in a culture chamber at 70-80% relative 
humidity and 30℃. Soft rot symptoms were developed at the inoculated site after 
twenty days of inoculation, while no symptoms appeared in the controls. Bacteria 
reisolated from the inoculated tissues had similar phenotypes and identical 
molecular characteristics as the original isolate. To our knowledge, this is the 
first report of the occurrence of P. rettgeri on calla lily in China. P. 
rettgeri was described as a rhizobacterium that promotes the growth of vegetable 
crops and lichens from Brazil (Cavalcante da Silva et al. 2020; Swamy et al. 
2016). In contrast, it was recently identified as the pathogenic bacterium which 
cause brown slime flux on Populus tomentosa, a Chinese deciduous tree (Zhou et 
al. 2020). In the present study, the soft rot was identified as a major disease 
affecting the growth of calla lily and posing a great threat to commercial calla 
lily industry. It also provides insights that more studies should be performed 
on the epidemiology of the disease in different parts of China to establish 
effective disease management strategies.","DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-02-23-0374-PDN

cruciferous crops worldwide. Agricultural practice is a preferable clubroot 
management strategy due to its low investment requirement and environmental 
safety. Among the agricultural practices, solarization has been widely applied 
in the integrated management of other soilborne diseases. However, there are 
only a few reports on the effect of solarization on clubroot management. In this 
study, we measured the effect of plastic mulching on soil temperature at 
different depths and on clubroot incidence and severity under greenhouse and 
field conditions. The pathogen density in soil after solarization was measured 
by quantitative PCR analysis. Results indicated that the mulching treatment was 
able to increase soil temperature especially in the soil layer ranges of 0 to 20 
cm. Solarization with mulching also effectively reduced the incidence and 
severity of clubroot in the greenhouse assay and the field trial by decreasing

biological management of potato scab disease and better tuber quality, we 
assessed the possible use of Bacillus velezensis as a biocontrol agent. B. 
velezensis K-9 inhibited up to 44.90% of infection by Streptomyces scabies, the 
causative agent of potato scab. Treatment of the S. scabies infected potato with 
B. velezensis K-9 resulted in a significant reduction in the depth of the 
disease lesions compared to untreated infected potato. Using a radish seedling 
test, B. velezensis K-9 culture and cell-free filtrate significantly reduced (P 
< 0.05) potato scab disease symptoms suggesting that strain K-9 was able to 
reduce S. scabies pathogenesis on potato. In a field test, the disease index and 
the scab index for B. velezensis K-9 against potato scab were significantly 
different from the control. In 2021, potato yields for the B. velezensis K-9 
treated plants were 12.44% higher than the control. In 2022, the potato yields 
following B. velezensis K-9 treatment increased by 12.65% compared to the 
control. In conclusion, B. velezensis K-9 prevented potato scab and also 
increased potato yield. Thus, B. velezensis K-9 is substantially reduced potato 
scab and could be used as a potential biocontrol agent for the management of 
soil-borne diseases of potatoes.","DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-12-22-2829-RE

humeral condylar fractures (HCF). Spaniel breeds have been reported to be at 
increased risk of HCF due to a high prevalence of humeral intracondylar fissures 
(HIF), which can predispose to fracture. The aims of this retrospective, single 
center, observational study were twofold. First, to compare the signalment, 
fracture configuration, and etiology of populations of FBD and spaniel breeds 
presenting with HCF at a single hospital. Second, to evaluate the computed 
tomographic (CT) findings of the contralateral elbow joints of FBD and spaniel 
breeds presenting with HCF for concomitant pathology. FBDs were overrepresented 
for HCF, most commonly presenting when skeletally immature, with a median age of 
3.7 months. Fractures of the lateral condyle were the most common configuration 
for both breed groups. Sclerosis at the fracture site was identified in 62% of 
FBD and 95% of spaniels undergoing CT scans. Humeral intracondylar fissures and 
intracondylar sclerosis were commonly observed in the contralateral elbows of 
FBD (44% and 50%, respectively) and spaniel breeds (58% and 95%, respectively). 
Medial coronoid pathology, elbow incongruency, and periarticular osteophytes 
were not identified in the contralateral elbows of FBD but were identified in 
29%, 4%, and 20% of spaniels, respectively. The high prevalence of HIF in the 
FBD group may be a predisposing factor for HCF in this breed.","© 2023 The Authors. Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound published by Wiley

(SA), and three drugs, ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), and diazepam (DZP), 
which share the same binding site, were investigated for their interaction with 
bovine SA (BSA). For KP, DZP, and IBP, where drug-concentration-dependent 
quenching of BSA-intrinsic fluorescence was observed, a modified Stern-Volmer 
plot showed that dynamic quenching was dominant for KP and static quenching was 
dominant for DZP and IBP. However, this alone cannot be compared with NPX. 
Therefore, by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) fluorescence 
spectroscopy, we were able to find the behavior of the 
drug-concentration-dependent Langmuir-type principal component vectors. KSVD 
obtained by the Langmuir equation showed a high correlation with the static 
extinction constant V. Therefore, KSVD indicates the association constant of the 
drug with BSA and it was found that NPX and IBP had higher values than KP. 
Finally, in the analysis of the temperature factors of amino acid residues in 
each drug-binding region and Trp residues, KP and NPX significantly reduced 
these temperature factors whereas DZP and IBP hardly changed them. This result 
is consistent with the dynamic and static quenching dominance in the total 
quenching mechanism. Summarizing the results so far, it was shown that 
penetration into the hydrophobic core inside BSA can be achieved not only by one 
of the multiple aromatic rings and propionic acid groups but also by the joint 
effect of both. In this study, SVD enabled us to extract information on drug 
adsorption to BSA from fluorescence spectra. Furthermore, the application of SVD 
is expected to make it possible to perform fluorescence analysis for drug 
binding to proteins without being limited by the fluorescence properties of the 
drug.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.3c00169

age-friendly environment would help to delay the onset of disability. Older 
populations in Indonesia have a high percentage of informal employment, a low 
educational level, low percentages of affluent households, and few leisure

(LI) on lesion characteristics and the incidence of steam pops.
METHODS: Radiofrequency applications at a range of powers (30, 40, and 50 W), 
contact forces (CF) (5, 15, and 25 g), and durations (15, 30, 45, and 120 s) 
using perpendicular/parallel catheter orientation were performed in 40 excised 
porcine preparations, using a catheter capable of monitoring LI (StablePoint©, 
Boston Scientific). To simulate the variability in blood-pool impedance, the 
saline-pool LI was modulated by calibrating saline concentrations. Lesion 
characteristics were compared under three values of saline-pool LI: 120, 160, 
and 200 Ω.
RESULTS: Of 648 lesions created, steam pops occurred in 175 (27.0%). When power, 
CF, time, and catheter orientation were adjusted, ablation at a saline-pool 
impedance of 160 or 200 Ω more than doubled the risk of steam pops compared with 
a saline-pool impedance of 120 Ω (Odds ratio = 2.31; p = .0002). Lesions in a 
saline-pool impedance of 120 Ω were significantly larger in surface area (50 
[38-62], 45 [34-56], and 41 [34-60] mm2 for 120, 160, and 200 Ω, p < .05), but 
shallower in depth (4.0 [3-5], 4.4 [3.2-5.3], and 4.5 [3.8-5.5] mmfor 120, 160, 
and 200 Ω, respectively, p < .05) compared with the other two settings. The 
correlation between the absolute LI-drop and lesion size weakened as the 
saline-pool LI became higher (e.g., 120 Ω group (r2  = .30, r2  = .18, and r2 
 = .16, respectively for 120, 160, and 200 Ω), but the usage of %LI-drop 
(= absolute LI-drop/initial LI) instead of absolute LI-drop may minimize this 
effect.

imposed dormancy while JS 335 was permeable and exhibited imbibitional injury. 
Bhatt seed coats had comparatively higher concentrations of phenols, tannins,

cracked seed coats in JS 335 is mainly due to less tannin in seed coats. The

applications in clean energy conversion, but cost and durability continue to 
limit commercialization. This work presents a new class of catalyst/electrode 
architecture that does not rely on Pt particles or carbon supports, eliminating 
the primary degradation mechanisms in conventional electrodes, and thereby 
enabling transformative durability improvements. The coaxial nanowire electrode 
(CANE) architecture consists of an array of vertically-aligned nanowires, each 
comprising an ionomer core encapsulated by a nanoscale Pt film. This unique 
design eliminates the triple phase boundary and replaces it with two double 
phase boundaries, increasing Pt utilization. It also eliminates the need for 
carbon support and ionomer binder, enabling improved durability and faster mass 
transport. Fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies based on CANEs demonstrate 
extraordinary durability in accelerated stress tests (ASTs), with only 2% and 5% 
loss in performance after 5,000 support AST cycles and 30,000 catalyst AST 
cycles, respectively. The high power density and extremely high durability 
provided by CANEs could enable a paradigm shift from random electrodes based on

progression. Recently, the FDA approved the use of anti-programmed death-ligand 
1 antibody (anti-PD-L1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors against 
aggressive BC. Despite the paradigm shift in BC treatments, patients still 
suffer from resistance, recurrence and serious immune-related adverse events. 
These obstacles require unravelling of the hidden molecular contributors for 
such therapy failure hence yielding therapeutics that are at least as efficient 
yet safer. Inflammasome pathway is activated when the pattern recognition 
receptor senses danger signals (danger-associated molecular patterns) from 
damagedRdying cells or pathogen-associated molecular patterns found in microbes, 
leading to secretion of the active pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). It has been shown throughout numerous 
studies that inflammasome pathway enhanced invasion, metastasis, provoked BC 
progression and therapy resistance. Additionally, inflammasomes upregulated the 
proliferative index ki67 and enhanced PD-L1 expression leading to immunotherapy 
resistance. IL-1β contributed to significant decrease in oestrogen receptor 
levels and promoted BC chemo-resistance. High levels of IL-18 in sera of BC 
patients were associated with worst prognosis. Stimulation of purinergic 
receptors and modulation of adipokines in obese subjects activated inflammasomes 
that evoked radiotherapy resistance and BC progression. The micro RNA miR-223-3p 
attenuated the inflammasome over-expression leading to lowered tumour volume and 
lessened angiogenesis in BC. This review sheds the light on the molecular 
pathways of inflammasomes and their impacts in distinct BC subtypes. In 
addition, it highlights novel strategies in treatment and prevention of BC.","DOI: 10.1017/erm.2023.14

promoted in the presence of salts as per the following trend: NaCl < KH2PO4 < 
NaH2PO4 ≪ Na2CO3. Aggregation was found to be endothermic, and hydrophobic 
interactions (TΔSmic > ΔHmic) prevailed. The enthalpy-entropy compensation plot 
was found to be linear for both copolymers. Demicellization occurred in the 
presence of KI as it facilitated the buildup of water structures around the 
copolymer chains. This could be verified from the increase in the cloud point, 
critical micelle concentration, and free energy. Overall, the temperature and

serious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The 
efficacy and survival of plasma exchange (PE) for TA-TM have not been fully 
clarified. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on diagnostic criteria for 
TA-TMA.  MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 32 patients diagnosed 
with TA-TMA by different diagnostic criteria from January 2018 to February 2022 
at the First Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital. RESULTS (1) The 
patients with TA-TMA treated with PE in this study had a remission rate of 
42.8%, a 100-day OS of 47.6%, and a 6-month OS of 38.1%. The only factor 
affecting the response to PE treatment was the number of PE sessions (P = 
0.047). (2) III-IV aGVHD prior to TA-TMA diagnosis (P = 0.002), renal or 
neurological dysfunction (P = 0.021), and the time to onset of TA-TMA (P = 
0.002) were independent risk factors for overall survival with TA- TMA. (3) 
Probable TA-TMA had the highest survival rate, but the Jodele criteria are 
expected to diagnose earlier and provide the greatest benefit to patients. 
CONCLUSIONS PE is an effective treatment for TA-TMA especially in cases where 
complement blockers are not available. In addition, probable TA-TMA improved 
prognostic survival through early detection of patients with TA-TMA. There is a 
need for further large prospective trials to identify the population more 
suitable for PE treatment of TA-TMA and more valid diagnostic criteria.","DOI: 10.12659/AOT.939890

record a prevalence of 7.2% in individuals over 30 years and is expected to 
increase in the future. Many of them will end up undergoing hemodialysis 
treatment, and vascular access is not only an essential requirement for the 
technique, but also a determining factor in their prognosis; for all these 
reasons, every nephrologist should have both theoretical and practical knowledge 
of vascular access; however, the practical training is generally uneven and 
dependent on the hospital in which you train. It is within this context that the 
N-PATH (Nephrology Partnership for Advancing Technology in Healthcare) program 
was born with the objective of training 40 young European nephrologists in 
theoretical and practical aspects of Interventional Nephrology. To fulfill its 
mission, the 2-year program is composed of four modules of 6 months each 
including theoretical courses and hands-on training: Renal Expert in Molecular 
Pathology (REMAP), Renal Expert in Vascular Access (REVAC), Renal Expert in 
Medical Ultrasound (REMUS), and Renal Expert in Peritoneal Dialysis (REPED). By 
bringing together young nephrologists from all over Europe, the goal is also to 
create a strong network and promote Nephrology career at the European level. 
This publication highlights the experience of fellows who attended the REVAC 
hands-on training in Milan, focused on simulation and virtual reality for 
vascular access, and its impact on their nephrology training.","DOI: 10.1177/11297298231180325

vibrations to the inner ear, triggering changes in the auditory ossicles and 
their associated joints due to mechanical overload. This study primarily aims to 
evaluate these overload-induced modifications in the stapes head resulting from 
the immobilization of the base of the third auditory ossicle in otosclerosis 
patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a comparative analysis of patients 
undergoing their first surgery for otosclerosis. The test group consisted of 31 
patients who underwent stapedotomy between 2020-2021. For comparison, we 
utilized a control group comprising stapes samples extracted during vestibular 
schwannoma surgeries via a transcochlear approach. A prospective analysis of 
bone tissue surface topography and chemical composition was executed using 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS SEM analysis of the stapes head in 
otosclerosis patients relative to the control group displayed no significant 
differences in chemical composition or the presence of otosclerotic foci. 
Nonetheless, various forms of bone tissue surface damage were noted on the 
stapes head in all otosclerosis patients. Mild changes were evident in 90% of 
the samples, while small linear bone tissue fractures were observed in 58% of 
the samples. Furthermore, minor osteophytic changes were detected in 16% of the 
samples. CONCLUSIONS The immobilization of the stapes base by otosclerotic foci 
instigates overloads in the incus-stapes joint, leading to the eventual 
remodeling of the stapes head articular surface.","DOI: 10.12659/MSM.939679

mid-trimester pregnancy losses and preterm births. Abdominal cerclages prevent 
these complications, particularly in patients with a history of failed vaginal 
cerclage or severe cervical deformities. However, pregnancy complications such 
as chorioamnionitis and fetal demise may necessitate cerclage removal. The 
removal methods vary, with the least invasive being the colpotomy approach, 
associated with lower morbidity rates than the transabdominal approach or 
laparoscopy. CASE REPORT We detail a case involving a 31-year-old woman with a 
twin pregnancy at 18 weeks gestation, complicated by COVID-19 and 
chorioamnionitis. This clinical scenario necessitated the removal of an 
abdominal cerclage. Given the patient's risk profile, a posterior colpotomy 
approach was deemed most suitable. CONCLUSIONS The posterior colpotomy approach 
provided an effective and less risky method for abdominal cerclage removal in a 
high-risk patient. It successfully mitigated the potential complications of

electrical products, potentially causing detrimental effects on the 
eco-environment and humans. Besides reported HOAs, many unknown HOAs may be 
present in electrical product plastics and urgently require identification and 
characterization. This study performed nontarget analysis and comprehensive 
characterization of HOAs in three typical electrical product plastics by 
nontarget analysis using gas chromatography-negative chemical 
ionization-high-resolution mass spectrometry in association with 
in-house-developed chlorine/bromine-specific data-processing algorithms. A total 
of 674 formulas of HOAs were identified in the plastics dismantled from three 
electrical products, among which 166, 362, and 146 were organochlorines, 
organobromines, and mix-chlorinated/brominated organic compounds, respectively. 
The identified HOAs were semiquantified, and the total concentrations of HOAs in 
individual plastics were 445-1549 ng/g. Organobromines showed the most species 
and the highest abundances in all of the plastics, of which the abundances 
accounted for 86.6-98.0% of the total HOAs. Partial HOAs (209 formulas) were 
tentatively structurally elucidated, which were classified into 13 groups, i.e., 
halogenated alkyl phenoxyethyls (H-alkyl phenoxyethyls), H-alkylbenzenes, 
H-benzenes, H-bisphenol A (H-BPAs), H-dioxins, H-diphenyl ethers, 
H-biphenyls/terphenyls, H-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, H-phenols, H-phenyl 
esters, H-phenyl-aldehydes/ketones, H-quinones, and an undefined group 
containing the HOAs such as dechlorane plus and chlordane. H-BPAs were the 
predominant HOAs in the plastics, showing relatively high concentrations (13-281 
ng/g), and tetrabromobisphenol A was the most abundant H-BPA, with the 
concentrations of 9-196 ng/g. The comprehensive characterization results 
represent a holistic picture on the species features and abundance distributions 
of HOAs in electrical product plastics and provide an inventory of crucial HOAs 
worthy of concern. HOAs may migrate from plastics and release into the 
environment and are possibly an important source of halogenated organic 
pollutants in the environment, thus calling for further investigation and proper 
regulation.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01422

effect of an exposure on an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental 
variables. MR analyses that use variants from only a single genetic region 
(cis-MR) encoding the protein target of a drug are able to provide supporting 
evidence for drug target validation. This paper proposes methods for cis-MR 
inference that use many correlated variants to make robust inferences even in 
situations, where those variants have only weak effects on the exposure. In 
particular, we exploit the highly structured nature of genetic correlations in 
single gene regions to reduce the dimension of genetic variants using factor 
analysis. These genetic factors are then used as instrumental variables to 
construct tests for the causal effect of interest. Since these factors may often 
be weakly associated with the exposure, size distortions of standard t-tests can 
be severe. Therefore, we consider two approaches based on conditional testing. 
First, we extend results of commonly-used identification-robust tests for the 
setting where estimated factors are used as instruments. Second, we propose a 
test which appropriately adjusts for first-stage screening of genetic factors 
based on their relevance. Our empirical results provide genetic evidence to 
validate cholesterol-lowering drug targets aimed at preventing coronary

reported to be an effective treatment option for acute cholecystitis. At our 
institution, ENGBD was first placed for external fistula management, and 
endoscopic internalization by cutting was performed, shifting to endoscopic 
transpapillary gallbladder stenting (EGBS) after improvement of cholecystitis. 
However, there has been no comparative study to define which preoperative 
management is better: converting ENGBD to EGBS or removing ENGBD. The study 
aimed to compare the incidence rate of the late adverse events (AEs) related to 
biliary system between shifting from ENGBD to EGBS and removal of ENGBD.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 122 patients who underwent ENGBD for acute 
cholecystitis between January 2010 and October 2022. The patients were divided 
into two groups: the cutting group (converting ENGBD to EGBS) and the removal 
group (removal of ENGBD). The short and late clinical outcomes were compared 
between groups.
RESULTS: Endoscopic transpapillary naso-gallbladder drainage was successfully 
placed in 78.6% (96/122), and elective cholecystectomy was performed in 31 and 
36 patients in the cutting and removal groups, respectively. The cumulative 
late-AE rates were 6.4% and 33.3% (p = .007), with a median waiting period for 
elective cholecystectomy of 58 and 33 days (p = .390) in the cutting and removal 
groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, only endoscopic 
internalization by cutting was an independent factor affecting late AEs.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic internalization by cutting ENGBD after the resolution of 
acute cholecystitis was considered effective in reducing the risk of late AEs 
during the waiting period for an elective cholecystectomy.",© 2023 Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery.,"DOI: 10.1002/jhbp.1344

reassessment given widespread vaccination, less virulent variants, contemporary 
evidence and a need to increase access to safe surgery. We, therefore, updated 
previous recommendations to assist policymakers, administrative staff, 
clinicians and, most importantly, patients. Patients who develop symptoms of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection within 7 weeks of planned surgery, including on the day of 
surgery, should be screened for SARS-CoV-2. Elective surgery should not usually 
be undertaken within 2 weeks of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For patients 
who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and who are low risk or having 
low-risk surgery, most elective surgery can proceed 2 weeks following a 
SARS-CoV-2 positive test. For patients who are not low risk or having anything 
other than low-risk surgery between 2 and 7 weeks following infection, an 
individual risk assessment must be performed. This should consider: patient 
factors (age; comorbid and functional status); infection factors (severity; 
ongoing symptoms; vaccination); and surgical factors (clinical priority; risk of 
disease progression; grade of surgery). This assessment should include the use 
of an objective and validated risk prediction tool and shared decision-making, 
taking into account the patient's own attitude to risk. In most circumstances, 
surgery should proceed unless risk assessment indicates that the risk of 
proceeding exceeds the risk of delay. There is currently no evidence to support 
delaying surgery beyond 7 weeks for patients who have fully recovered from or

placental oestrogens and progesterone blood concentrations in intrapartum cows. 
Our research tests the hypothesis that intrapartum uterine torsion impairs the 
ability of the placenta to synthesize steroids and may also suppress the release 
of synthesized steroids into the maternal circulation.
METHODS: The study included a total number of 37 intrapartum dairy cows of 
various breeds and ages. These animals were transported to our clinic by their 
owners. Furthermore, general and obstetrical examinations of all these animals 
were performed in our clinic. The uterine torsion (UT) group consisted of 20 
animals. The presence of UT was verified during clinical general examinations by 
vaginal and transrectal examination. The comparison (C) group included 17 
animals whose birth was undisturbed or could be terminated with moderate 
obstetrical assistance. The clinical examination of group C animals showed no 
problems with their general health and genital organs. Blood samples were 
collected immediately after the initial obstetrical examination from 37 cows for 
radioimmunological measurement of estradiol-17β (E2), free total estrogen (FTE), 
conjugated total estrogen (CTE), and progesterone (P4).
RESULTS: In terms of P4, there was no statistical difference between the two 
groups. For all estrogen parameters, however, concentrations were significantly 
lower in the UT group than in the C group. In the correlation analysis, there 
was a significant correlation between the P4 and the FTE in the C group. 
Furthermore, the positive correlation between all estrogen parameters in the UT 
group was significant. In group C, significant positive correlations were found 
apart from the correlation between E2 and CTE.
CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the hypothesis and suggest that in 
UT animals processes dependent on estrogens or other placental hormones may be 
impaired during the peri- or postpartum period.","© 2023 The Authors. Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley &

industries; however, drawbacks such as uneven polymerization and high 
reducibility limit its utilization. Nonreducing maltoheptaose (N-G7) is a good 
substitute for maltodextrin owing to its single degree of polymerization and 
nonreducing properties. Herein, in vitro cell factory biotransformation of 
β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) to N-G7 is demonstrated using coexpressed 
cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase, EC 3.2.1.54) and maltooligosyltrehalose synthase 
(MTSase, EC 5.4.99.15). However, the cell membrane prevents β-CD from entering 
the cell owing to its large diameter.
RESULTS: The amylase-deficient permeabilized host ΔycjM-ΔmalS-ΔlpxM is utilized 
for coexpression of recombinant CDase and MTSase. Deletion of lpxM effectively 
allows the entry of β-cyclodextrin into the cell, despite its large diameter, 
without requiring any relevant cell membrane permeability-promoting reagent. 
This results in a 28.44% increase in the efficiency of β-CD entry into the cell, 
thus enabling intracellular N-G7 synthesis without the extracellular secretion 
of recombinant CDase and MTSase. After reacting for 5.5 h, the highest purity of 
N-G7 (65.50%) is obtained. However, hydrolysis decreases the purity of N-G7 to 
49.30%, thus resulting in a conversion rate of 40.16% for N-G7 when the reaction 
lasts 6 h. Precise control of reaction time is crucial for obtaining high-purity 
N-G7.
CONCLUSION: Whole-cell catalysis avoids cell fragmentation and facilitates the 
creation of an eco-friendly, energy-efficient biotransformation system; thus, it 
is a promising approach for N-G7 synthesis. This article is protected by

development of fibrosis in multiple organs. Indeed, it contributes to diseases 
such as pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis among others. Currently, its 
expression in OSF and the specific mechanisms are not well understood. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the role of IL-13 in OSF and further explore 
whether IL-13 regulates-polarization of M2-macrophages in OSF. Initially, in the 
tissues of patients with OSF, we observed a high expression of M2-macrophages 
and IL-13 protein. Additionally, we found a correlation between the expression 
of IL-13 and the stage of OSF. Arecoline inhibited the proliferation of 
fibroblasts (FBs) and promoted IL-13 production in vitro. Furthermore, our 
observations revealed that M2-macrophages increased upon co-culturing 
M0-macrophages with supernatants containing the IL-13 cytokine. In conclusion, 
our study demonstrated that arecoline stimulates FBs leading to increased 
secretion of IL-13, which in turn IL-13 leads to polarization of M2-macrophages 
and promotes the occurrence of OSF. This suggests that IL-13 may be a potential 
therapeutic target of OSF.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by

(#)Contributed equally","Although individuals born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW; ≤1000 g) are 
known to be at greater risk for mental health problems than individuals born at 
normal birth weight (NBW; ≥2500 g), contributions of postnatal growth to these 
relations have not been fully explored. We compared individual differences in 
the Ponderal Index [(PI; weight(kg)/height(m3)] and head circumference (HC) in 
predicting internalizing and externalizing behaviors in childhood and 
adolescence in a cohort of ELBW survivors (N = 137) prospectively followed since 
birth. Baseline models indicated that infants who were born thinner or with 
smaller HC showed greater PI or HC growth in the first 3 years. Latent 
difference score (LDS) models showed that compensatory HC growth in the first 
year (ΔHC = 20.72 cm), controlled for birth HC, predicted ADHD behaviors in 
adolescence in those born with smaller HC. LDS models also indicated that the PI 
increased within the first year (ΔPI = 1.568) but decreased overall between 
birth and age 3 years (net ΔPI = -4.597). Modeling further showed that larger 
increases in the PI in the first year and smaller net decreases over 3 years 
predicted more internalizing behaviors in adolescence. These findings suggest 
early growth patterns prioritizing weight over height may have negative effects 
on later mental health in ELBW survivors, consistent with developmental 
programming theories.","DOI: 10.1017/S0954579423000573

broad range of bioapplications. However, neither the development of native 
extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived natural biopolymer-functionalized 
G-quadruplex hydrogels nor their use to create perfusable self-supporting 
hydrogels has been explored to date, despite their intrinsic potential as 
carrier vehicles of therapeutic agents, or even living cells in advanced 
regenerative therapies, or as platforms to enable the diffusion of nutrients and 
oxygen to sustain long-term cell survival. Herein, we developed a dynamic 
co-assembling multicomponent system that integrates guanosine (G), 
3-aminophenylboronic acid functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA-PBA), and potassium 
chloride to bioengineer strong, homogeneous, and transparent HA-functionalized 
G-quadruplex hydrogels with injectable, thermo-reversible, conductive, and 
self-healing properties. The supramolecular polymeric hydrogels were developed 
by hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions between G coupled via dynamic 
covalent boronate ester bonds to HA-PBA and stabilized by K+ ions, as 
demonstrated by a combination of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. 
The intrinsic instability of the self-assembled G-quadruplex structures was used 
to bioengineer self-supporting perfusable multicomponent hydrogels with 
interconnected size and shape-tunable hollow microchannels when embedded in 3D 
methacrylated gelatin supporting matrices. The microchannel-embedded 3D 
constructs have shown enhanced cell viability when compared to the bulk 
hydrogels, holding great promise for being use as artificial vessels for 
enabling the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen essential for cell survival. The 
proposed approach opens new avenues on the use of ECM-derived natural 
biopolymer-functionalized dynamic G-quadruplex hydrogels to design 
next-generation smart systems for being used in tissue regeneration, drug 
screening, or organ-on-a-chip.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.3c00433

have revolutionized the management, prognosis, and quality of life of diabetes 
patients and their environment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact 
of implementing the MiniMed 780G closed-loop system in a pediatric and 
adolescent population previously treated with a continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion pump and intermittent glucose monitoring.
METHODS: Data were collected from 28 patients with type 1 diabetes aged 6 to 
17 years, with a follow-up of 6 months. We included both glucometric and quality 
of life variables, as well as quality of life in primary caregivers. Metabolic 
control variables were assessed at baseline (before system change) and at 
different cutoff points after initiation of the closed-loop system (48 hours, 
7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months).
RESULTS: Time in range 70-180 mg/dL increased from 59.44% at baseline to 74.29% 
in the first 48 hours after automation of the new system, and this improvement 
was maintained at the other cutoff points, as was time in hyperglycemia 180-250

Most common type of BLCA is urothelial carcinoma (UC). Fibrillin 2 (FBN2) was 
first discovered while studying Marfan syndrome, and its encoded products are 
associated with elastin fibres. To date, the role of FBN2 in BLCA remains 
unclear. The authors first downloaded data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The patients were divided into high FBN2 
expression and low FBN2 expression groups, and the survival curve, clinical 
characteristics, tumour microenvironment (TME), and immune cell differences were 
analysed between the two groups. Then, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were filtered, and functional enrichment for DEGs was performed. Finally, 
chemotherapy drug susceptibility analysis based on the high and low FBN2 groups 
was conducted. The authors found upregulated expression of FBN2 in BLCA and 
proved that FBN2 could be an independent prognostic factor for BLCA. TME 
analysis showed that the expression of FBN2 affects several aspects of the TME. 
The upregulated expression of FBN2 was associated with a high stromal score, 
which may lead to immunosuppression and be detrimental to immunotherapy. In 
addition, the authors found that NK cells resting, macrophage M0 infiltration, 
and other phenomena of immune cell infiltration appeared in the high expression 
group of FBN2. The high expression of FBN2 was related to the high sensitivity 
of some chemotherapy drugs. The authors systematically investigated the effects 
and mechanisms of FBN2 on BLCA and provided a new understanding of the role of 
FBN2 as a risk factor and TME influencer in BLCA.","© 2023 The Authors. IET Systems Biology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on

molecular patterns produced by stress and induces inflammatory responses 
mediated by receptors of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) on the cell 
surface. Meanwhile, soluble RAGE (sRAGE) exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect by 
capturing HMGB1. Animal models have shown upregulation of HMGB1 and RAGE in the 
brain or blood, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in depression 
pathophysiology. However, there have been no reports using blood from depressed 
patients, nor ones focusing on HMGB1 and sRAGE changes associated with treatment 
and their relationship to depressive symptoms.
METHODS: Serum HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay in a group of patients with severe major depressive disorder 
(MDD) (11 males and 14 females) who required treatment with electroconvulsive 
therapy (ECT), and also in a group of 25 age- and gender-matched healthy 
subjects. HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations were also measured before and after a 
course of ECT. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale 
for Depression (HAMD).
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations 
in the MDD group compared to healthy subjects. Although ECT significantly 
improved depressive symptoms, there was no significant change in HMGB1 and sRAGE 
concentrations before and after treatment. There was also no significant 
correlation between HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations and the HAMD total score or 
subitem scores.
CONCLUSION: There were no changes in HMGB1 and sRAGE in the peripheral blood of 
severely depressed patients, and concentrations had no relationship with

scalp. The limited treatment options for FAGA necessitate the development of new 
strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the potential benefit of using a 
combination therapy composed of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and a 
non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) compound in the treatment of FAGA.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-series study, which enrolled nine female 
patients with FAGA between September 2021 and December 2022. The 
non-cross-linked HA compound (Hearty®, Imeik Technology Development Co., Ltd.) 
and PRP were implanted into the areas of hair loss over four treatment sessions 
separated by 4-week intervals. Patients were monitored for overall improvement 
in their hair loss, hair count, treatment satisfaction, and adverse events at 1, 
3, and 6 months follow-up.
RESULTS: The improvement rates, subjectively evaluated by the study physician, 
were 88.89% at the 1-month and 100% at the 3-month follow-up, relative to 
baseline. Moreover, the quantitative evaluation results showed that the FAGA 
patients' hair density increased by 54.51% at the 1-month and by 77.25% at the 
3-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The combination of PRP and non-cross-linked HA compound appeared to 
be a certain positive effective procedure for FAGA without serious adverse 
event. We envisage that this work will contribute to the development of new

ligase (MITOL) protein in fibroblasts was decreased by UVA and that the 
knock-down (KD) of MITOL increased the secretion of matrix metalloprotease-1 
(MMP-1) by fibroblasts. A recent study reported that MITOL suppresses 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by stabilizing the interaction between ER and 
mitochondria (MT) through the ubiquitination of mitofusin 2. These facts suggest 
that a decrease of MITOL would increase the secretion of MMP-1 through ER 
stress, but the detailed mechanism of that process in dermal fibroblasts remains 
unclear. Thus, this study was conducted to clarify the involvement of ER stress 
in the oversecretion of MMP-1 induced by the decreased MT quality caused by 
MITOL-KD.
METHODS: MITOL-KD normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDFs) were prepared by 
treating them with MITOL-small interfering RNA, after which their MMP-1 protein 
levels were measured. ER stress in NHDFs was evaluated by measuring the mRNA 
levels of spliced X-box binding protein 1 (sXBP1) and the protein levels of 
inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α).
RESULTS: MITOL-KD NHDFs enhanced the secretion of MMP-1 via interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
elicited by the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). The secretion of 
MMP-1 could be abrogated by a neutralizing IL-6 antibody and by JSH23, which is 
an inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Furthermore, MITOL-KD NHDFs as well as 
UVA-irradiated NHDFs showed increased ER stress levels. In addition, 
tunicamycin, which is an inducer of ER stress, also increased MMP-1 secretion.
CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the decrease of MITOL caused the 
oversecretion of MMP-1 via NF-κB-IL-6 signaling through the activation of ER 
stress in fibroblasts.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/phpp.12897

the increasingly used P+E for surgical abortion with general anesthetic. We 
conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and

effectiveness was evaluated by measuring the time to lose consciousness (LOC), 
recovery time and success sedation rate. Safety was assessed by hemodynamics and 
adverse events during and post-operation. The time to LOC and recovery time in 
R+E was 5 s shorter and 1 min longer than that in P+E respectively (both

Bradycardia incidence and injection site pain were less frequent in R+E group 
than that in P+E group. More rash was observed in R+E group compared with P+E 
group (32% vs. 5%, p<0.001), but all were mild (only chest rash) and resolved 
subsequently. Low dose of remimazolam in combined with esketamine has favorable

search strategy was developed a priori according to the Preferred Reporting

ubAVMs. Overall, the conservative group had the lowest risk of rupture 
(P-score=0.77), and the lowest rate of complications was found in the 
conservative group (P-score=1). Among different interventions, the multimodality 
group had the highest rupture risk (P-score=0.34), the lowest overall 
complications (P-score=0.75), the best functional improvement (P-score=0.65), 
and the lowest overall mortality (P-score=0.8). However, multimodality treatment 
showed a significantly higher risk of rupture (odds ratio [OR]=2.13; 95%

95% CI=3.37-9.15) compared to conservative management; nevertheless, there were 
no significant differences in overall mortality or functional independence when 
considered independently. Conservative management is associated with the lowest 
rupture risk and complication rate overall. A multimodal approach is the best 
option when considering mortality rates and functional improvement in the 
context of existing morbidity/symptoms. Microsurgery, embolization, and 
radiosurgery alone are similar to the natural history in terms of functional 
improvement and mortality, but have higher complication rates.","DOI: 10.5469/neuroint.2023.00171

considerations of flow diverter (FD) treatment using a Flow Re-direction 
Endoluminal Device (FRED) for unruptured intracranial vertebral artery 
dissecting aneurysms (VADAs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 23 patients with 
unruptured intracranial VADAs who underwent FD treatment using a FRED between 
June 2017 and August 2021. Symptoms, imaging findings, treatment strategies, and 
angiographic and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Dissections were categorized 
according to the dominance of the VA in which they occurred: dominant VA, 
co-dominant VA, and non-dominant VA.
RESULTS: All patients successfully underwent FD treatment with either a FRED 
(n=11) or FRED Jr. (n=12). Complete occlusion rates were 78.3% at 6-month 
follow-up magnetic resonance angiography and 91.3% at 12-month. There were no 
instances of complications, recurrence, or retreatment during a median follow-up 
of 20 months. Dissections occurred in the dominant VA in 3 cases (13.0%), the 
co-dominant VA in 13 cases (56.5%), and the non-dominant VA in 7 cases (30.4%). 
Intimal flap and true lumen stenosis were observed in 39.1% and 30.4% of cases, 
respectively. Four cases required a bilateral VA approach due to technical 
difficulties, all in the non-dominant VA.
CONCLUSION: Flow diversion treatment using a FRED for unruptured intracranial 
VADAs proved feasible and safe, yielding satisfactory occlusion rates. Technical 
challenges were more likely in lesions involving non-dominant VAs in the acute 
or subacute stage, mainly due to associated intraluminal lesions compromising

for improved mood. The present study consists of observations of the development 
of one of these systems. Descriptions of the trial emphasise the powerful role 
of the intrinsically motivated, responsible participant on one hand and the 
empowering machine learning (ML)-based technology on the other. This 
conceptualisation is shown to extend the neoliberal paradox of a freedom that, 
to be maintained, must be continually adjusted through discipline. Because of 
the paradoxical nature of this formulation, laboratory members disagree about 
the balance of agency between the objective machine learning system and the 
empowered participant. The guides who help participants interpret ML outputs and 
implement system recommendations are ascribed a replaceable role in formal 
accounts. Observations of this guidance practice make clear not only the 
important role played by guides but also how their work is relegated to the 
technological side of the broader formulation of the trial and further how this 
conceptualisation affects the way they conduct their work.","© 2023 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons

response to changes in climate and disturbances. The responses to these multiple 
environmental drivers, and the mechanisms underlying the changes, remain largely 
unknown. Here, we use a functional trait approach on timescales of 10,000 years 
to assess how climate and disturbances influence the community-mean adult 
height, leaf area, seed mass, and wood density for eight lowland and highland 
forest landscapes. To do so, we combine data of eight fossil pollen records with 
functional traits and proxies for climate (temperature, precipitation, and El 
Niño frequency) and disturbances (fire and general disturbances). We found that 
temperature and disturbances were the most important drivers of changes in 
functional composition. Increased water availability (high precipitation and low 
El Niño frequency) generally led to more acquisitive trait composition (large 
leaves and soft wood). In lowland forests, warmer climates decreased 
community-mean height probably because of increased water stress, whereas in 
highland forests warmer climates increased height probably because of upslope 
migration of taller species. Disturbance increased the abundance of acquisitive, 
disturbance-adapted taxa with small seeds for quick colonization of disturbed 
sites, large leaves for light capture, and soft wood to attain fast height 
growth. Fire had weak effects on lowland forests but led to more stress-adapted 
taxa that are tall with fast life cycles and small seeds that can quickly 
colonize burned sites. Site-specific analyses were largely in line with 
cross-site analyses, except for varying site-level effects of El Niño frequency 
and fire activity, possibly because regional patterns in El Niño are not a good 
predictor of local changes, and charcoal abundances do not reflect fire 
intensity or severity. With future global changes, tropical Amazonian and Andean 
forests may transition toward shorter, drought- and disturbance-adapted forests 
in the lowlands but taller forests in the highlands.",© 2023 The Authors. Global Change Biology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/gcb.16818

change on subsecond scales. However, particle interactions can be hidden or 
invisible-even when measured with thermal noise sensitivity, leading to 
misconceptions about their binding behavior. Here, it is demonstrated how 
invisible particle interactions at the cell periphery become visible by MHz 
interferometric thermal noise tracking and frequency decomposition at a spectral 
update rate of only 0.5 s. The particle fluctuations are analyzed in radial and 
lateral directions by a viscoelastic modulus G(ω,tex ) over the experiment time

tips within 2 s with particle contact invisible by the fluctuation width. 
Second, the extent and stiffness of the soft cell glycocalyx is measured, which

cancer by detecting tumors at an early stage. There is currently interest in 
moving away from the age-based screening programs, and toward personalized 
screening based on individual risk factors. To accomplish this, risk prediction 
models for breast cancer are needed to determine who should be screened, and 
when. We develop a novel approach using a (random effects) continuous growth 
model, which we apply to a large population-based, Swedish screening cohort. 
Unlike existing breast cancer prediction models, this approach explicitly 
incorporates each woman's individual screening visits in the prediction. It 
jointly models invasive breast cancer tumor onset, tumor growth rate, 
symptomatic detection rate, and screening sensitivity. In addition to predicting 
the overall risk of invasive breast cancer, this model can make separate 
predictions regarding specific tumor sizes, and the mode of detection (eg, 
detected at screening, or through symptoms between screenings). It can also 
predict how these risks change depending on whether or not a woman will attend 
her next screening. In our study, we predict, given a future diagnosis, that the 
probability of having a tumor less than (as opposed to greater than) 10-mm 
diameter, at detection, will be, on average, 2.6 times higher if a woman in the

assessment of motor behavior in dementia, however, few studies addressed 
circadian aspects of mobility. This cross-sectional explorative study analyzed 
the timing of peak mobility-related behavior, the prevalence of mobility-related 
sundowning and nocturnal mobility-related behavior and associated clinical 
characteristics in acute geriatric psychiatry.
METHODS: Mobility-related behavior of 73 patients (M: 81 years) was measured 
over 48 h using lower-back worn hybrid motion sensors. We derived the start of 
the 30-min period with peak gait activity (highest number of steps) for each day 
and the number of nocturnal steps taken from 10PM to 7AM. Professional caregiver 
ratings of the patients' motor behavior were conducted within the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).
RESULTS: The mean start time of peak gait activity was 2:37PM, but large 
variations in timing were found (range: 3:25AM-9:30PM). Twenty-five patients 
(34%) were identified as ""sundowners"". Nocturnal mobility-related behavior was 
measured in 35 patients (53%), whereas professional caregivers assessed 
night-time disorders in only 19 patients (26%). Clinical characteristics of 
""sundowners"" were not significantly different from other patients, except for 
lower doses of antipsychotics as compared to non-sundowners (M:1.6 mg/day; 
p = 0.015). The number of nocturnal steps was significantly associated to 
corresponding NPI ratings (Spearman's rho = 0.4; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Analyzing the timing of peak gait activity and nocturnal step-count 
seem to provide clinical applicable information on the circadian aspects of 
mobility-related behavior in acute geriatric psychiatry. Even though the 
clinical validity needs to be evaluated, objective information on the individual 
circadian aspects of mobility-related behavior could help to personalize 
treatment with benefits for patients and caregivers.","© 2023 The Authors. International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry published by

fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and cardiovascular disease or overall mortality has 
been reported, it is unclear whether there is an association between MAFLD and 
cancer incidence or mortality. We aimed to investigate the differential risk of 
all- and site-specific cancer incidence and mortality according to MAFLD 
subgroups categorized by additional etiologies of liver disease.
METHODS: Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, we 
stratified the participants into three groups: (1) single-etiology MAFLD 
(S-MAFLD) or MAFLD of pure metabolic origin; (2) mixed-etiology MAFLD (M-MAFLD) 
or MAFLD with additional etiological factor(s) (i.e., concomitant liver diseases 
and/or heavy alcohol consumption); and (3) non-MAFLD. Hepatic steatosis and 
fibrosis were defined using the fatty liver index and the BARD score, 
respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate the 
risk of cancer events.
RESULTS: Among the 9,718,182 participants, the prevalence of S-MAFLD and M-MAFLD 
was 29.2% and 6.7%, respectively. During the median 8.3 years of follow-up, 
510,330 (5.3%) individuals were newly diagnosed with cancer, and 122,774 (1.3%) 
cancer-related deaths occurred among the entire cohort. Compared with the 
non-MAFLD group, the risk of all-cancer incidence and mortality was slightly 
higher among patients in the S-MAFLD group (incidence, adjusted hazard ratio 
[aHR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.04; mortality, aHR = 1.06; 
95% CI: 1.04-1.08) and highest among patients with M-MAFLD group (incidence, aHR 
= 1.31; 95% CI: 1.29-1.32; mortality, aHR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.42-1.48, 
respectively). The M-MAFLD with fibrosis group (BARD score ≥ 2) showed the 
highest relative risk of all-cancer incidence (aHR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.36-1.39), 
followed by the M-MAFLD without fibrosis group (aHR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.06-1.11). 
Similar trends were observed for cancer-related mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: MAFLD classification, by applying additional etiologies other than 
pure metabolic origin, can be used to identify a subgroup of patients with poor 
cancer-related outcomes.","© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Communications published by John Wiley & Sons

development targeting to address the problem of energy scarcity. 
Electrocatalytic water splitting is being explored as a convenient catalytic 
reaction in this context, and promising amorphous nanomaterials (ANMs) are 
receiving increasing attention due to their excellent catalytic 
properties.Oxygen group-based amorphous nanomaterials (O-ANMs) are an important 
component of the broad family of ANMs due to their unique amorphous structure, 
large number of defects, and abundant randomly oriented bonds, O-ANMs induce the 
generation of a larger number of active sites, which favors a better catalytic 
activity. Meanwhile, amorphous materials can disrupt the inherent features of 
conventional crystalline materials regarding electron transfer paths, resulting 
in higher flexibility. O-ANMs mainly include VIA elements such as oxygen, 
sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and other transition metals, most of which are 
reported to be free of noble metals and have comparable performance to 
commercial catalysts Pt/C or IrO2 and RuO2 in electrocatalysis. This review 
covers the features and reaction mechanism of O-ANMs, the synthesis strategies 
to prepare O-ANMs, as well as the application of O-ANMs in electrocatalytic 
water splitting. Last, the challenges and prospective remarks for future 
development in O-ANMs for electrocatalytic water splitting are concluded.",© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.,"DOI: 10.1002/smll.202302341

national scale are not common in developing countries. The aim of this work is 
to report the process of creation of a prospective national colorectal cancer 
registry in a middle-income country in Latin America and the main results of a 
pilot study involving eight centres.
METHOD: The project involved the creation of a national database including all 
patients operated on for colorectal cancer in Argentina and a 30-year plan to 
make improvements based on the information provided by the registry. The first 
phase comprised the prospective registration of all patients treated in eight 
tertiary referral centres during a 6-month period.
RESULTS: Three hundred and seventeen patients were prospectively recruited 
during the study period, and 244 (77%) were operated on for colon cancer. The 
completion rate for all variables was >95%. The median age for the group was 
66.88 years. Right-sided colon tumours were the most frequent. Colorectal 
specialists performed 257 (81.07%) of the procedures, and in 273 (87.22%) 
patients a laparoscopic approach was used with an overall conversion rate of 
12.45%. Major complication and anastomotic leakage rates for the group were 
18.55% and 8.81%, respectively. The mortality rate was 1.94%. Multivariate 
analysis showed that young patients and operations performed by general surgeons 
were the most common factors independently related to worse postoperative 
outcomes. Note that this manuscript describes an early phase of the project that 
included only eight tertiary referral centres.
CONCLUSION: Despite its limitations, this study describes the effort made to 
generate reliable data on which to base future decisions to improve patient 
care. Furthermore, it might set an example for other developing countries to 
start their own registries.",© 2023 Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.,"DOI: 10.1111/codi.16634

lithography, but it demonstrates little effect on exposure dose in high-energy 
lithography. Furthermore, theoretical studies using DFT simulations to 
investigate the plausible photoacid-catalyzed, electron-triggered dissociation, 
and accompanying radical reaction are performed, and a mechanism is demonstrated 
that the nanoscale patterning of this type of MOCs is driven by the solubility 
switch resulting from dissociation-induced strong electrostatic interaction and

in addressing needs related to sexuality and intimacy. These issues are 
compounded when supporting clients with intellectual disability, due to 
prevailing assumptions about capacity and few practical support resources. At a 
disciplinary level, there is ongoing discourse around how to best conceptualise 
and support sexual and gender identities generally, within models of human 
occupation. Leveraging interdisciplinarity, where sexuality overlaps as a sphere 
of interest, can aid the development of practical support resources. Engagement 
with sociology (focussed on relationality) and disability studies (focussed on 
embodiment) offers a generative path forward.
METHODS: The deliberative dialogues framework was used to develop a co-designed 
resource by occupational therapists for occupational therapists. Six Australian 
occupational therapists with experience working with clients with intellectual 
disability and/or sexuality were purposively recruited to participate in 
co-design groups. Using the eight features of deliberative dialogue, data was 
collected and analysed by an interdisciplinary research team to collaboratively 
produce a practical support resource.
RESULTS: Participants agreed the greatest need was to develop a resource for 
clinicians, to support conversations with clients about sexuality. Five key 
themes emerged: (1) Theoretical explanations addressing why sexuality is 
important must be paired with practical advice; (2) make a conversational call 
to action from 'OTs' for 'OTs' by locating sexuality within the domain of 
occupational therapy; (3) make explicit that people with intellectual disability 
are sexual beings; (4) need for self-reflection; and (5) demonstrate how 
existing understandings of occupation apply to sexuality.
CONCLUSION: A resource in the form of a brochure was developed, intended to be 
used as a conversation primer. The process used to develop the resource 
demonstrated the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and the utility of 
deliberative dialogue as a co-design method.","© 2023 The Authors. Australian Occupational Therapy Journal published by John

the mammalian brain, including the amygdala and the entorhinal and perirhinal 
cortices. Their functional role is unknown but we have previously shown that 
neonatal and adult hippocampal lesions increase their differentiation in the 
monkey amygdala. Here, we assessed whether hippocampal lesions similarly affect 
immature neurons in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. Since Bcl2-positive 
cells were found mainly in areas Eo, Er, and Elr of the entorhinal cortex and in 
layer II of the perirhinal cortex, we also used Nissl-stained sections to 
determine the number and soma size of immature and mature neurons in layer III 
of area Er and layer II of area 36 of the perirhinal cortex. We found different 
structural changes in these regions following hippocampal lesions, which were 
influenced by the time of the lesion. In neonate-lesioned monkeys, the number of 
immature neurons in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices was generally higher 
than in controls. The number of mature neurons was also higher in layer III of 
area Er of neonate-lesioned monkeys but no differences were found in layer II of 
area 36. In adult-lesioned monkeys, the number of immature neurons in the 
entorhinal cortex was lower than in controls but did not differ from controls in 
the perirhinal cortex. The number of mature neurons in layer III of area Er did 
not differ from controls, but the number of small, mature neurons in layer II of 
area 36 was lower than in controls. In sum, hippocampal lesions impacted 
populations of mature and immature neurons in discrete regions and layers of the 
entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, which are interconnected with the amygdala 
and provide major cortical inputs to the hippocampus. These structural changes

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify druggable targets of 
active constituents of A. indica A. Juss. for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
using network pharmacology and validation of activity through molecular docking 
analysis.
METHODOLOGY: Targets of all the active phytochemicals from A. indica were 
predicted and genes related to NSCLC were retrieved. A protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network of the overlapping genes were prepared. Various 
databases and servers were employed to analyse the disease pathway enrichment 
analysis of the clustered genes. Validation of the gene/protein activity was 
achieved by performing molecular docking, and ADMET profiling of selected 
phytocompounds was performed.
RESULT: Gene networking revealed three key target genes as EGFR, BRAF and PIK3CA 
against NSCLC by the active components of A. indica. Molecular docking and ADMET 
analysis further validated that desacetylnimbin, nimbandiol, nimbin, nimbinene, 
nimbolide, salannin and vepinin are the best suited anti- NSCLC among all the 
phytocompounds present in this plant.

in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI). The inflammatory biomarkers assessed were: 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(dNLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte*platelet ratio (NLPR), systemic inflammatory

patients undergoing PCI were enrolled. The frequency of CI-AKI was 15.2% (n = 
144). The levels of NLR, MLR, NLPR, SII, and SIRI were higher in the CI-AKI 
group than in the Non-CI-AKI group (P < .05). The addition of NLR ≥2.96, dNLR 
≥2.08, NLPR ≥.012, SII ≥558.04, and SIRI ≥1.13 to the Mehran score model 
significantly increased the area under the curve (P < .05). Multivariable 
logistic regression analyses indicated that inflammatory biomarkers were 
significantly associated with CI-AKI, including NLR ≥2.96 (OR = 1.588, P =

renal cancer, is one of the significant health concerns due to limited 
clinically effective treatments. Nevertheless, targeting carcinoma-associated 
fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment has emerged as a promising innovative 
strategy for renal cancer therapy. Thus, this study is aimed to explore the role 
and molecular mechanism of urine-derived stem cells (USCs) in the progression 
and metastasis of ccRCC. Initially, wound-healing and transwell experiments were 
used to assess the migration and invasion abilities of the cells. Then, western 
blot analysis (WB) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses were used to demonstrate the relevant protein and 
messenger RNA expression levels. Finally, hematoxylin-eosin and 
immunohistochemical stainings were performed to evaluate metastasis and protein 
expression in lung tumors. The coculture of USCs with the ccRCC cell lines 
significantly enhanced their migratory and invasive abilities. WB and qRT-PCR 
analyses exhibited that ccRCC cell lines significantly increased cell mobility 
markers transcriptional and protein levels in USCs. Finally, the in vivo 
investigations in nude mice showed that USCs promoted the proliferation and 
migration of ccRCC-based xenograft tumors. In summary, these findings 
demonstrated that USCs promoted ccRCC tumorigenesis and development in vivo and 
in vitro by regulating the Runt-related transcription factor 3/transforming 
growth factor-β1 signaling axis.","© 2023 The Authors. Cell Biology International published by John Wiley & Sons

feature of many solid tumours and is a key pathogenic driver in the inherited 
condition Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Modulation of the tumour 
microenvironment by extracellular vesicles (EVs) is known to facilitate the 
development of various cancers. The role of EVs in modulating the tumour 
microenvironment and their impact on the development of TSC tumours, however, 
remains unclear. This study, therefore, focuses on the poorly defined 
contribution of EVs to tumour growth in TSC. We characterised EVs secreted from 
TSC2-deficient and TSC2-expressing cells and identified a distinct protein cargo 
in TSC2-deficient EVs, containing an enrichment of proteins thought to be 
involved in tumour-supporting signalling pathways. We show EVs from 
TSC2-deficient cells promote cell viability, proliferation and growth factor 
secretion from recipient fibroblasts within the tumour microenvironment. 
Rapalogs (mTORC1 inhibitors) are the current therapy for TSC tumours. Here, we 
demonstrate a previously unknown intercellular therapeutic effect of rapamycin 
in altering EV cargo and reducing capacity to promote cell proliferation in the 
tumour microenvironment. Furthermore, EV cargo proteins have the potential for 
clinical applications as TSC biomarkers, and we reveal three EV-associated

(BP) and functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients but whether this is 
causal or due to confounding is uncertain. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) 
to assess causality, and also explore whether particular classes of 
anti-hypertensives were associated with a better outcome after ischemic stroke.
METHODS: We selected genetic variants associated with systolic and diastolic BP 
and BP-lowering variants in genes encoding antihypertensive drugs from 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 757,601 individuals. The primary 
outcome was 3-month dependence or death defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 
of 3-6. The secondary outcome was disability or death after 90 days defined as 
mRS 2-6. The Cochran's Q statistic in the Inverse variance weighted (IVW) model, 
the weighted median, MR-Egger regression, leave-one-SNP-out analysis, 
MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier methods were adopted as sensitivity 
analyses. To validate our primary results, we performed independent repeat 
analyses and Bi-directional MR analyses.
RESULTS: Genetic predisposition to higher systolic and diastolic BP was 
associated with disability or death after ischemic stroke in univariable IVW MR 
analysis (OR=1.29, 95%CI 1.05-1.59, p=0.014; OR=1.27, 95%CI 1.07-1.51, p=0.006, 
respectively). Pulse pressure was associated with both dependence or death and 
disability or death after ischemic stroke (OR=1.05, 95%CI 1.02-1.08, p=0.002; 
OR=1.04, 95%CI 1.01-1.07, p=0.009, respectively). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor (ACEI) and calcium channel blocker (CCB) were significantly associated 
with improved functional outcomes (dependence or death, OR=0.76, 95%CI 
0.62-0.94, p=0.009; OR=0.89, 95%CI 0.83-0.97, p=0.005). Proxies for β-blockers, 
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and thiazides failed to show associations 
with functional outcomes (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: We provide evidence for an association of genetic predisposition to 
higher BP with a higher risk of 3-month functional dependence after ischemic 
stroke. Our findings support ACEI and CCB as promising antihypertensive drugs 
for improving functional outcomes in ischemic stroke.","DOI: 10.1177/17474930231185695

nanotechnology applications and fundamental nanoscience research. They are a 
facile and inexpensive nanofabrication tool, but the quality factor of these 
opals has drastic differences between reports. Additives like ethanol, ions, and 
organic molecules in the aqueous particle spreading solution are known to affect 
the quality factor and growth efficiency of the produced opals. However, a 
systematic study on the effect and optimization of some of the most effective 
additives has not been reported until now. Here, we investigate the influence of 
additives on the growth efficiency and quality factor of such monolayers formed 
at the air-water interface without the use of a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. The 
additives induced large variations in the monolayer quality factor and growth 
efficiency, and we found that the ideal additive content of the spreading agents 
is 30 wt % < cethanol < 70 wt %, 0 < cH2SO4 < 30.5 mM, and 0 < csty < 255.0 mM. 
This study provides a guideline for the rational composition and additive 
content of the spreading solution to obtain high-quality two-dimensional opals 
for further applications in nanofabrication and photonics and will enable 
researchers and application engineers to produce standardized nanofabrication 
materials.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00418

once-daily, 600-μg cotadutide in Japanese type 2 diabetes patients with a body 
mass index of 25 kg/m2 or higher.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phase I, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study (NCT04208620) enrolled patients to receive subcutaneous 
cotadutide at an escalating dose to determine the highest tolerated clinical 
dose (Cohort 1), then applied in Cohort 2. The primary endpoint was safety, 
including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); secondary endpoints 
included glycaemic control and body weight.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients were randomly allocated to receive cotadutide or 
placebo in a 3:1 ratio. All patients were Asian, 62.5% were male, and the median 
age and body mass index were 60 years and 27.2 kg/m2 , respectively. Through the 
follow-up period of the study, 11/12 (91.7%) patients in the cotadutide group 
experienced a TEAE versus 1/4 (25.0%) patients in the placebo group. All TEAEs 
were mild, except for one moderate event. There were no deaths, serious TEAEs or 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation. Gastrointestinal-related events were the 
most common TEAEs. Cotadutide-treated patients achieved significantly improved 
7-day mean glucose measured by continuous glucose monitoring; the 7-day mean 
(standard deviation) at the end of treatment (day 70) was 112.23 (20.79) versus 
206.85 (3.62) mg/dL for placebo. Mean respective changes in HbA1c were -1.13%

aimed to observe the behaviors of two different strains under coinfection and

directly by labeling Magnaporthe oryzae strains with the green fluorescent 
proteins and mushroom cherry fluorescent protein to observe mixed strain 
behavior in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, multiomics analyses were conducted to 
explore the underlying mechanisms at the genomic, transcriptomic, and

affect disease severity and that the more weakly virulent strain benefits from 
the coinfection system. We also found that amino acid variation might negatively 
influence such interactions at transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. In 
addition, we showed that the overexpression of a glutamine-related gene improved 
strain competitiveness during mixture cultivation. Collectively, our results 
provided experimental methods to analyze the interaction between two strains of

strongly to environmental changes than small and lower trophic-level organisms. 
However, whether this trophic or size-dependent sensitivity also applies to the 
most abundant animals, microscopic soil-borne nematodes, remains largely 
unknown. Here, we sampled an altitudinal transect across the Tibetan Plateau and 
applied a community-weighted mean (CWM) approach to test how differences in 
climatic and edaphic properties affect nematode CWM biomass at the level 
of community, trophic group and taxon mean biomass within trophic groups. We 
found that climatic and edaphic properties, particularly soil water-related 
properties, positively affected nematode CWM biomass, with no overall impact of 
altitude on nematode CWM biomass. Higher trophic-level omnivorous and predatory 
nematodes responded more strongly to climatic and edaphic properties, 
particularly to temperature, soil pH, and soil water content than lower 
trophic-level bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes. However, these 
differences were likely not (only) driven by size, as we did not observe 
significant interactions between climatic and edaphic properties and mean 
biomasses within trophic groups. Together, our research implies a stronger, 
size-independent trophic sensitivity of higher trophic-level nematodes compared 
with lower trophic-level ones. Therefore, our findings provide new insights into 
the mechanisms underlying nematode body size structure in alpine grasslands and 
highlight that traits independent of size need to be found to explain increased 
sensitivity of higher trophic-level nematodes to climatic and edaphic 
properties, which might affect soil functioning.",© 2023 The Authors. Global Change Biology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/gcb.16814

reperfusion injury remain unknown when baseline setting is optimal for 
endovascular treatment and procedural setting is the best in stroke patients 
with large vessel occlusion (LVO).
AIMS: To identify clinical and radiological/procedural predictors for 
hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and cerebral edema (CED) at 24 hours in patients 
obtaining complete recanalization in one pass of thrombectomy for ischemic 
stroke ≤6 hours from symptoms onset with intra-cranial anterior circulation LVO 
and ASPECTS ≥6.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study on prospectively collected data from 1400 
patients enrolled in the Italian Registry of Endovascular Treatment in Acute 
Stroke.
RESULTS: HT was reported in 248 (18%) patients and early CED was reported in 260 
(19.2%) patients. In the logistic regression model including predictors from a 
first model with clinical variables and from a second model with 
radiological/procedural variables, diabetes mellitus (OR 1.832, 95% CI 
1.201-2.795), higher NIHSS (OR 1.076, 95% CI 1.044-1.110), lower ASPECTS (OR 
0.815, 95% CI 0.694-0.957), and longer onset-to-groin time (OR 1.005, 95% CI 
1.002-1.007) were predictors of HT, whereas general anesthesia was inversely 
associated with HT (OR 0.540, 95% CI 0.355-0.820). Higher NIHSS (OR 1.049, 95% 
CI 1.021-1.077), lower ASPECTS (OR 0.700, 95% CI 0.613-0.801), intravenous 
thrombolysis (OR 1.464, 95% CI 1.061-2.020), longer onset-to-groin time (OR 
1.002, 95% CI 1.001-1.005), and longer procedure time (OR 1.009, 95% CI 
1.004-1.015) were predictors of early CED. After repeating a fourth logistic 
regression model including also good collaterals, the same variables remained 
predictors for HT and/or early CED, except diabetes mellitus and thrombolysis, 
while good collaterals were inversely associated with early CED (OR 0.385, 95% 
CI 0.248-0.599).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher NIHSS, lower ASPECTS, and longer onset-to-groin time were 
predictors for both HT and early CED. General anesthesia and good collaterals 
were inversely associated with HT and early CED, respectively. Longer procedure 
time was predictor of early CED.","DOI: 10.1177/17474930231185690

(1)Department of Anthropology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.","OBJECTIVES: Identifying scurvy and rickets has important implications for 
understanding adaptations and variability among past communities, and 
bioarchaeologists now regularly evaluate these conditions. Due to the increased 
number of studies, cases with less clear-cut lesions and variable preservation 
are now frequently reported. Despite an improved understanding of the biological 
mechanisms for disease expression, there is a lack of consensus on the language 
used to express diagnostic certainty, limiting comparability. This article aims 
to address these issues and provide recommendations on more consistent 
diagnostic terminology using widely accepted diagnostic methodology based on 
biological mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We review diagnostic terms used in bioarchaeology by 
considering published cases of rickets, scurvy and co-occurrence alongside 
M.B.B.'s past project notes. We also consider differences in the diagnosis of 
rickets and scurvy in living and archeological individuals.
RESULTS: We provide recommendations on a framework that can be used to show 
diagnostic certainty in cases of rickets, scurvy, and co-occurrence. Core 
lesions of rickets and scurvy are used alongside a limited lexicon of diagnostic 
terminology based on the Istanbul protocol.
DISCUSSION: It is not the number of lesions that determines whether an 
individual is assigned to a particular diagnosis category, but rather the range 
and expression of lesions present. Avoiding a ""tick-list"" approach to core 
lesions of these diseases will be critical to ensure that identifying rickets 
and scurvy continues to contribute to understanding adaptations and variability 
among past communities. The framework allows more consistency in diagnostic 
certainty, facilitating greater comparability in research.","© 2023 The Authors. American Journal of Biological Anthropology published by

ultrasonography (US) in predicting non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD) in 
patients with diabetes, using histologic findings as the reference standard.
METHODS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients with diabetes who underwent renal 
Doppler US and native kidney biopsy were included in this retrospective, 
single-institutional study. Based on histologic findings, patients were 
classified as having diabetic nephropathy (DN) or NDKD. Renal Doppler US 
findings, including cortical echogenicity, corticomedullary differentiation, and 
the resistive index (RI), were compared between DN and NDKD. A subgroup analysis 
according to chronic kidney disease (CKD) status was also performed.
RESULTS: Cortical echogenicity and corticomedullary differentiation showed no 
significant differences between DN and NDKD (P=0.887 and P>0.99, respectively), 
whereas the RI was significantly higher in patients with DN than in those with 
NDKD (P=0.032). The subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference in the 
RI between DN and NDKD in patients with diabetes and CKD (P=0.010), but a 
significant difference was not found in those without CKD (P=0.713). When 
limited to patients with diabetes and CKD, the RI had an area under the curve 
value of 0.759, sensitivity of 57.1%, specificity of 81.0%, positive likelihood 
ratio of 3.0, and negative LR of 0.5 for predicting NDKD, using a cutoff value 
of ≤0.69.
CONCLUSION: Renal Doppler US may be useful in predicting NDKD in patients with 
diabetes and CKD.","DOI: 10.14366/usg.23028

patients since they are usually excluded from clinical trials. A recent trial of 
Mobile Stroke Units (MSUs) demonstrated faster treatment and improved outcomes, 
and included PD patients.
AIM: Determine outcomes with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and benefit of 
MSU versus management by emergency medical services (EMS), for PD patients.
METHODS: Primary outcomes were utility-weighted modified Rankin Score (uw-mRS). 
Linear and logistic regression models compared outcomes in patients with vs 
without PD, and PD patients treated by MSU vs standard management by emergency 
medical services (EMS). Time metrics, safety, quality of life, and health-care 
utilization were compared.
RESULTS: 1047 tPA-eligible ischemic stroke patients; 254 with PD (baseline mRS 
2-5), and 793 without PD (baseline mRS 0-1). Although PD patients had worse 
90-day uw-mRS, higher mortality, more health-care utilization and worse 
quality-of-life than non-disabled patients, 53% returned to at least their 
baseline mRS, those treated faster had better outcome, and there was no 
increased bleeding risk. Comparing PD patients treated by MSU versus EMS, 90-day 
uw-mRS was 0.42 versus 0.36 (p=0.07) and 57% versus 46% returned to at least 
their baseline mRS. There was no interaction between disability status and MSU 
versus EMS group assignment (p=0.67), for 90-day uw-mRS.
CONCLUSION: Pre-existing disability did not prevent the benefit of faster 
treatment with tPA on a MSU. Our data support inclusion of PD patients in the 
MSU management paradigm.","DOI: 10.1177/17474930231185471

South Asian women are at risk of self-harm. Previous research suggested 
investigating individuals' experiences with self-harm with qualitative studies 
in developing self-harm prevention strategies. This research aims to explore 
self-harm experiences among South Asians in the United Kingdom.
DESIGN: Qualitative study.
METHODS: Participants were recruited via third-sector organizations and online 
platforms. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 South Asian 
individuals with a history of self-harm living in the United Kingdom. The data 
were analysed based on a reflective thematic analysis approach.
RESULTS: Results revealed four main themes: (1) reasons for self-harm; (2) 
recovery journey; (3) culture and mental health; and (4) the transition to 
suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Reasons for self-harm included negative life 
circumstances, social life difficulties, challenges faced during COVID-19 and 
mental health problems. Participants described their recovery journey by 
acknowledging the role of professional help, self-care, psychoeducation and 
personal growth, improving social relationships, and faith and spirituality. 
Cultural factors included generational differences and stigma. Culturally 
adapted psychological interventions were perceived as promising. The reported 
transition from self-harm to suicidal behaviours was linked to experiencing 
major stressful life events and the use of severe methods of self-harm.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that socio-cultural factors impact mental 
health and recovery processes among South Asians. Mental health services should 
consider improving culturally sensitive clinical practices in responding to 
self-harm among South Asian communities.","© 2023 The Authors. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy published by John Wiley

cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in 34 villages of district Mardan, Pakistan. Sand 
flies were collected to study their bionomics, breeding sites, and seasonal 
prevalence from July to September 2019. In 2020, we acquired and digitized data 
on CL patients in the region to assess the possible spread of the disease to new 
foci. In the study period, a total of 1572 sand flies were collected, comprising 
11 species. Phlebotomus sergenti (827, 52.61%) was the most widespread species. 
The soil pH in all samples was slightly alkaline (7-8.2) and potassium (K) was 
the richest component (59.4%). In 2020, there were 975 reported cases, which is 
an increase from 536 cases in 2019. Elevations of 361-588 m, agricultural land 
near human settlements, and quaternary alluvium formation had maximum CL cases. 
In univariate analysis, age between 25 and 35, nationality, family size (7-15 
individuals), knowledge of leishmaniasis, site of infection, family members 
suffering from leishmaniasis, knowledge of sand flies, the difference between 
mosquitoes and sand flies, biting times of sand flies, use of mosquito spray, an 
Afghan refugee in the region, preachers visiting, and material of house 
construction have been identified risk of getting CL (p < 0.05). In stepwise 
multivariate analysis, nationality, vegetation, site of infection, and material 
of house construction were more prone to CL (p < 0.05). This study highlights 
the potential risk factors and sand flies associated with the outbreak of CL in 
Mardan. The high abundance of P. sergenti suggests their possible role as 
vectors for the transmission of CL in the region. The increase in reported cases 
in 2020 compared to 2019 suggests a possible spread of the disease to new foci. 
The study also revealed that certain demographic and environmental factors were

impacts on biological ecosystems. Therefore, design of robust sensing strategies 
for multiplex detection of species with respect to their oxidation states or 
bonding conditions, i.e., chemical speciation, is quite consequential. Chromium 
(Cr) species are known as the most abundant inorganic groundwater pollutants and 
can be quite harmful to human health depending on their oxidation states. In the 
present study, a multicolorimetric probe based on silver-deposition-induced 
color variations of gold nanorods (AuNRs) was designed for identification and 
quantification of Cr species including Cr (III) and Cr (VI) (i.e., CrO42- and 
Cr2O72-) in water samples. In fact, the presence of Cr species leads to 
inhibition of the silver metallization of AuNRs to various degrees depending on 
the concentration and identity of the analyte. This process is accompanied by 
the blue shift of the longitudinal peak which results in sharp-contrast 
rainbow-like color variations, thereby providing great opportunity for highly 
accurate visual detection. The gathered dataset was then statistically analyzed 
using two pattern recognition and regression machine learning techniques. In 
particular, linear discriminant analysis was used as a classification method to 
discriminate the unicomponent and mixture samples of Cr species with 100% 
accuracy. Then, a well-known multivariate calibration technique called partial 
least-squares regression was employed for quantitative analysis of Cr species. 
Responses were linearly related to Cr species concentrations over a wide range 
of 10.0-1000.0, 1.0-200.0, and 1.0-200.0 μmol L-1 with detection limits of 37.7, 
8.7, and 2.9 μmol L-1 for Cr3+, CrO42-, and Cr2O72-, respectively. The practical 
applicability of the multicolorimetric probe was successfully evaluated by 
analyzing Cr species in several water specimens comprising tap water, mineral 
water, river water, and seawater. Above all, the vivid rainbow color tonality of 
the proposed assay further improves the accuracy of the naked eye detection, 
making it a practical platform for on-site monitoring of Cr contamination.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01904

cells, influence bacterial fitness in various ways. While phage-encoded 
accessory genes, for example virulence genes, can be highly beneficial, the 
production of viral particles is energetically costly and often reduces 
bacterial growth. Consequently, if costs outweigh benefits, bacteria evolve 
resistance, which can shorten phage epidemics. Abiotic conditions are known to 
influence the net-fitness effect for infected bacteria. Their impact on the 
dynamics and trajectories of host resistance evolution, however, remains yet 
unknown. To address this, we experimentally evolved the bacterium Vibrio 
alginolyticus in the presence of a filamentous phage at three different salinity 
levels, that is (1) ambient, (2) 50% reduction and (3) fluctuations between 
reduced and ambient. In all three salinities, bacteria rapidly acquired 
resistance through super infection exclusion (SIE), whereby phage-infected cells 
acquired immunity at the cost of reduced growth. Over time, SIE was gradually 
replaced by evolutionary fitter surface receptor mutants (SRM). This replacement 
was significantly faster at ambient and fluctuating conditions compared with the 
low saline environment. Our experimentally parameterized mathematical model 
explains that suboptimal environmental conditions, in which bacterial growth is 
slower, slow down phage resistance evolution ultimately prolonging phage 
epidemics. Our results may explain the high prevalence of filamentous phages in 
natural environments where bacteria are frequently exposed to suboptimal 
conditions and constantly shifting selections regimes. Thus, our future ocean 
may favour the emergence of phage-born pathogenic bacteria and impose a greater 
risk for disease outbreaks, impacting not only marine animals but also humans.",© 2023 The Authors. Molecular Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/mec.17050

According to morphological identification, Phlebotomus longicuspis s.l. (34.7%) 
was the second most abundant Phlebotomus species after P. sergenti, followed by 
atypical Phlebotomus perniciosus (7.1%); 11.6% of the male specimens of P.

HDP infants received intervention for hypoglycaemia alone (i.v. dextrose) with 
no other major intervention (respiratory support, parenteral nutrition, central 
line, arterial line or blood transfusion).
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of maternal HDP on late preterm and term admissions to 
NNU is high, with hypoglycaemia and respiratory disease being the main drivers 
for admission. Over one in four were admitted solely for management of 
hypoglycaemia. Further research should determine whether maternal 
antihypertensive agent choice or postnatal pathways may reduce NNU admission.","© 2023 The Authors. BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology

poly(ethyleneglycol)-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE-PEG2000 ), was 
introduced to prepare AF micelles using the thin-film hydration method. 
Amentoflavone was successfully encapsulated into the core, achieving an 
encapsulation efficiency of 98.80 ± 0.24% and a drug loading efficiency of 
2.96 ± 0.12%. The resulting micelles exhibited a spherical shape with a particle

412-fold, and cumulative drug release studies showed that AF release was much 
faster from the micelles compared with the free drug. The release of AF was 
sustained over time and followed a degradation-based kinetic model, similar to 
polymeric systems. After oral administration, the AF-loaded micelles 
demonstrated an enhanced oral bioavailability, which was 3.79 times higher than 
that of free AF. In vitro evaluations of the micelles' antitumor effects 
revealed a significantly greater efficacy compared with free AF. These findings

problems. Combination 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) 
may enhance the treatment of pathological scars, although the evidence base is 
limited.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and complication rates of 
combination intralesional TAC and 5-FU in comparison to monotherapy 
intralesional TAC or 5-FU for the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars.
METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL were searched by two independent reviewers. 
The primary outcome was treatment efficacy (51% to 100% improvement). Study 
quality and risk of bias were assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias tool, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Of 277 articles screened, 13 studies were included comprising 12 
randomised control trials (RCT) and 1 non-randomised study. There were six and 
nine studies comparing combination intralesional therapy versus monotherapy 5-FU 
and monotherapy TAC, respectively. The combined group demonstrated superior 
objective treatment efficacy compared to the monotherapy TAC group (OR 3.45, 95% 
C.I: [2.22-5.35], I 2=0%, P<0.00001) and monotherapy 5-FU group (OR 4.17, 95% 
C.I: [2.21-7.87], I 2=0%, P<0.0001). Telangiectasia was less frequent in 
combination therapy (OR 0.24, 95% CI: [0.11-0.52], I 2=0%, P=0.0003) compared to 
monotherapy TAC.

asymmetry, psychological distress, and poor quality of life in affected 
patients. The traditional approach (TA) for surgical correction has entailed a 
standard frontal craniotomy along with circumferential orbital osteotomy, 
vertical translocation of the orbit, and bone grafting to the lower maxilla. 
Caution has been expressed regarding its invasive transcranial nature. In this 
report, we describe the limited approach (LA) for simplified surgical correction 
of VOD, which obviates the need for a standard frontal craniotomy.
METHODS: A 45-year retrospective review was conducted of all patients that 
underwent surgical correction of VOD, as performed by a single surgeon. 
Demographic details, procedural characteristics, and complications were compared 
between patients who were corrected by the TA and those who were corrected by 
the LA. Complications were defined as CSF leak, infection of the frontal bone, 
permanent diplopia, permanent ptosis, sudden-onset vision loss, persistent 
asymmetry, and surgical revision.
RESULTS: Forty patients met inclusion criteria for correction of true VOD, of 
which 18 underwent the TA and 22 underwent the LA. Mean length of hospital stay 
was 5.3±2.3 days and 4.0±1.5 days for the TA and LA cohorts, respectively. Mean 
follow-up time was 4.9±7.5 years for the TA and 2.6±3.3 years for the LA. The 
only reported complications were persistent asymmetry in 2 patients in the TA 
cohort with one patient requiring surgical revision due to undercorrection, 
while the LA cohort exhibited no postoperative asymmetry or need for surgical 
revision.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the TA and LA are effective for surgical correction of VOD. 
The limited craniotomy of the LA reduces exposure of intracranial structures and 
adequately achieves postoperative symmetry.",Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.,"DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010857

muscle flaps in irreversible long-term facial paralysis. Several preoperative 
skin marking techniques for the masseteric nerve have been proposed to limit the 
surgical dissection area, shorten the surgical time, and enable a safer 
dissection. However, these have shown variability amongst them and cannot 
preoperatively visualize the nerve. Thus, we aim to design an observational 
study to validate a high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) nerve identification 
technique.
METHODS: a systematic HFUS examination was designed and performed to visualize 
the masseteric nerve in 64 hemifaces of healthy volunteers. One-third were 
randomly selected to undergo an additional HFUS-guided needle electrostimulation 
to validate the HFUS image.
RESULTS: the masseteric nerve was identified by HFUS in 96,9% of hemifaces (95% 
CI 0.89 to >0.99) and showed almost perfect agreement with direct needle 
stimulation as calculated with Cohen's kappa coefficient; 0.95 (CI 0.85 to 
1.00). It was found within the masseter muscle, in between the deeper muscle 
bellies, at 18,3 mm (SD ±2,2) from the skin. Only in 12,9% of cases (95 CI 0.06 
to 0.24) its course became adjacent to the mandible periosteum. Other important 
features, such as disposition in relation to the parotid gland or whether the 
nerve was directly covered by a thick intramuscular aponeurosis, could be well 
observed by HFUS.
CONCLUSIONS: HFUS enables masseteric nerve identification and can give the 
surgeon specific information on anatomical relations for each examined 
individual prior to surgery.",Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.,"DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010871

of consensus on the gold standard for secondary reconstruction in such cases. 
Herein, we determined the survival rate of a second flap following a total loss 
of an initial free flap during head and neck reconstructions and evaluated if 
there was a difference in the rate of secondary flap necrosis depending on the 
timing of reconstruction salvage.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1572 free flaps for head and neck 
reconstruction from 2010-2022. Patients who underwent secondary surgery with 
flaps after failure of primary free flap were included. Patients were divided 
into three groups based on the time for secondary flap reconstruction from the 
time of primary reconstruction (Group A, 0-5 days; Group B, 6-30 days; Group C, 
>30 days).
RESULTS: We identified 64 cases of complete flap loss after primary 
reconstruction requiring secondary reconstruction. Pedicled flaps were used in 
34.4% of the cases, while a second free flap was used in 65.6% of the cases. 
Overall, the flap failure rate for secondary reconstructions was 6.7% in Group 
A, 35.3% in Group B, and 6.7% in Group C (p=0.022). For free tissue transfer, 
the success rate of a secondary reconstruction was 92.3% in Group A, 28.57% in 
Group B, and 93.3% in Group C.
CONCLUSION: We favor an early microsurgical reconstruction (≤5 days) following 
primary reconstruction in cases of free flap failure. If early reconstruction 
cannot be performed, a deferred reconstruction with free tissue transfer (>30 
days) should be considered.",Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.,"DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010862

pieces of evidence with a focus on a possible relationship between CR and 
orthognathic surgery (OS). The work followed the ""Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol"" guidelines and was registered in 
the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration 
number: CRD42020168660). The search strategy produced 143 articles. After 
reading the abstracts, 113 articles were excluded, and the full-text articles in 
English of the remaining 30 studies were separately examined for eligibility by 
2 authors, with 20 of them being excluded because they did not meet the 
inclusion criteria. Finally, 10 systematic reviews were processed for critical 
evaluation. Young female patients with a high mandibular plane angle, diminished 
posterior facial height, posteriorly inclined condylar neck, and a 
counter-clockwise jaw rotation, are more likely to develop CR after OS. The most 
common procedure associated with CR in the included systematic reviews was the 
bimaxillary OS followed by bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. Hence, extreme 
caution and surgical modification should be used in these high-risk conditions. 
There is still a need for more evidence on the risks of OS or iatrogenic factors 
during the fixation of various osteosynthesis devices because it is still 
inconclusive and requires further justification.","Copyright © 2023 by Mutaz B. Habal, MD.","DOI: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000009382

unilateral cleft lip. Debate still continues on its surgical correction without 
sufficient studies to establish an effective management. This article presents 
our experience in correcting the columellar base deviation with the 
muscle-driven method in primary lip repair. The key is to perform extensive 
muscle dissection and reconstruction. In the medial lip segment, muscle 
dissection is performed subcutaneously up to the contralateral nostril floor for 
effective lengthening and rotation. In the lateral lip segment, muscle 
dissection is executed in both submucosal and subcutaneous planes, and muscle 
component is extensively separated from the lip skin and buccal mucosa. The 
lateral muscle flap is advanced and reattached to the contralateral nostril 
floor and columellar base using a subcutaneous sustaining suture. Cinching 
suture between columellar base and alar base is performed. These two sutures 
help to centralize and over-correct the columellar base. Bilateral muscle 
components are re-oriented and approximated in a Z-plasty format for lengthening 
of the lip. The patients were followed up for at least 3 years. Quantitative 
measurements of deviation in columellar base angulation were executed, which 
revealed 55.8±2.6° (before nasoalveolar molding), 29.6±1.7° (after nasoalveolar 
molding), and 2.8±0.4° (postoperative follow-up), respectively. The 
muscle-driven method represents a safe and effective technique to correct 
columellar base deviation in patients with unilateral cleft lip.",Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.,"DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010870

muscularity and/or leanness, combined with significant functional impairment. 
This study presented descriptive statistics for a range of clinically relevant 
questionnaires in one of the largest samples of adults with confirmed diagnoses 
of MD.
METHOD: We recruited 29 adults who met diagnostic criteria for MD as determined 
by semi-structured diagnostic interviews and administered a battery of 
questionnaires assessing MD symptomology, compulsive exercise, and disordered 
eating. Descriptive statistics were calculated for both total and subscale 
scores for each questionnaire. Raincloud plots are included to show the 
distribution of total scores.
RESULTS: Of the 29 participants, 26 completed all questionnaires. Mean scores 
were high across all questionnaires and broadly consistent with results in past 
studies that also recruited a clinical MD sample. Most participants scored above 
proposed clinical cut-off scores for questionnaires assessing compulsive 
exercise and disordered eating.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the small body of published questionnaire data 
in clinical MD samples. We stress that questionnaire scores should not be used 
alone to infer the presence of MD, but could be considered as a useful adjunct 
to a comprehensive clinical interview.","© 2023 The Authors. European Eating Disorders Review published by Eating

Center,Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.","BACKGROUND: There exists an increasing array of treatments proposed to prevent, 
alleviate, and abort symptoms of a migraine; however, for patients who undergo 
reconstructive microsurgery, caution must be taken to preserve vascular 
integrity. This study is the first-to-date scoping review of vascular and 
bleeding risk of current migraine therapies, with the purpose of identifying 
potential therapeutic agents for postoperative migraine management appropriate 
for microsurgical patients.
METHODS: Currently available migraine therapeutics were compiled from UpToDate 
and the American Academy of Family Physicians. A PubMed literature review was 
performed for each therapeutic's effect on bleeding or vascular involvement. 
Data were compiled into tables of abortive, symptom-controlling and 
prophylactic, and non-pharmacologic treatments. Expert microsurgeons reviewed 
the data to provide recommendations for optimized patient care.
RESULTS: Triptans and other ergot derivatives demonstrated strong evidence of 
vasoconstriction and were greatly advised against for immediate 
post-microsurgical use. Novel pharmaceutical therapies like Lasmiditan and CGRP 
antagonists have no literature indicating potential for vasoconstriction or 
hematoma and remain an investigational option for abortive medical treatment. 
For symptom control, acetaminophen appears the safest option, with clinical 
judgment and further research needed for use of NSAIDs. Alternative treatment 
techniques may include migraine prophylaxis with botulinum toxin injection or 
nutraceutical treatment via magnesium supplementation or Coenzyme Q10 
administration, minimizing the need for additional medication in the 
postoperative setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing reconstructive microsurgery have a unique 
medical profile limiting the therapeutic options available to treat migraines. 
This review provides preliminary evidence to be considered as a guide for 
prescribing therapeutics for migraine in the postoperative setting.",Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.,"DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010861

multidisciplinary VPI clinic between 2009 and 2020 were retrospectively 
reviewed. Pre- and postoperative speech assessments, perioperative 
characteristics, and complications were identified.
RESULTS: 36 children with ​22q and 40 with CLP were included. Age at surgery 
(p=0.121), pre-operative velopharyngeal competence score (VPC) (p=0.702), and 
pre-operative resonance (p=0.999) were similar between groups. Pharyngeal flaps 
were wider (p=0.038*) and length of stay longer in the 22q group (p=0.031*). On 
short term follow 4 months after surgery, similar speech outcomes were seen 
between groups. At long term follow up >12 months after surgery, 86.7% 22q v. 
100% CLP (p=0.122) had improvement in velopharyngeal function, however fewer 
children with 22q (60.0%) achieved a completely ""competent"" VPC score compared 
to those with CLP (92.6%) (p=0.016*). Nasal regurgitation improved for both 
groups, with a greater improvement in those with 22q (p=0.026*). Revision rate 
(p=0.609) and new onset OSA (0.999) were similar between groups.
CONCLUSION: Children with 22q have improved speech after pharyngeal flap, but 
may be less likely to reach normal velopharyngeal function over the long term 
than those with CLP; however, negative sequelae do not differ. Improvement in 
nasal regurgitation is a uniquely positive outcome in this population.",Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.,"DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010854

necessitating surgical intervention. This study seeks to examine the validity of 
the Wisconsin Classification System (WCS) in guiding the surgical management of 
AABP. Additionally, we aimed to identify which factors contribute to 
postoperative complications and persistent symptoms following AABP repair.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent surgical repair 
of AABP from 2015-2021 by the senior author at our institution. Patients were 
categorized according to anatomic characteristics using the WCS. Preoperative 
symptoms, postoperative symptoms, and postoperative complications were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Fifty-two patients underwent AABP repair. The mean age was 56.5±14.8 
years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 350.0±517.4 days. The assigned 
preoperative WCS score was congruent with operative management in most patients 
(86.0%). Morbid obesity (BMI>40.0kg/m2) and postoperative complications were 
associated with persistent symptoms following AABP repair (p=0.026 and p=0.021, 
respectively). Increased WCS score was not associated with persistent 
postoperative symptoms (p=0.314). Morbid obesity (p=0.003), diabetes (p=0.029) 
and having a panniculectomy during AABP repair (p=0.046) increased the odds for 
developing postoperative complications. Patients with Type I AABP had 
significantly fewer complications than those with Type II, III, or IV (p=0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: The Wisconsin Classification System serves as a preoperative guide, 
an educational tool for patients, and provides a framework for the discussion of 
intraoperative maneuvers and the likelihood of complications. It is imperative 
to counsel patients on the surgical management of AABP and the postoperative 
course, as this may permit realistic patient expectations and optimize outcomes.",Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.,"DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010868

due to ease of use and is now subsidized in Australia for blood glucose 
measurement for patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Dysglycaemia is common 
following kidney transplantation and is associated with worse outcomes and there 
are data to support the use of FGM post-transplant to better detect and manage 
changes in blood glucose levels. There is, however, no data on patient or staff 
perceptions of FGM, or resource implications in this setting. We prospectively 
evaluated patients and nursing staff experiences of FGM compared to traditional 
capillary glucose measurement in the immediate post-transplant setting, along 
with resource utilization, cost of testing, staff time taken to test and 
accuracy. Twenty-one kidney transplant recipients had a FGM sensor applied in 
the post-operative period and results compared to capillary blood glucose 
monitoring (CBGM) measured at least four times a day. Six-hundred-fifty-six 
glucose measurements were obtained, median per patient of 30 readings (IQR 10). 
Pearson's correlation between FGM and CBGM readings is 0.95 (p < .001). FGM 
readings were lower than CBGM by an average of 1.2 mmol/L (SD 0.7). Using a 
5-point preference questionnaire (with ratings varying from strongly 
disagree-strongly agree), both patients and nurses were highly satisfied with 
the usability and convenience of FGM, with all preferring FGM over CBGM. Average 
time to perform FGM was 3.6 s versus 64 s for CBGM. In average, cost of FGM was 
$58 less than traditional testing per patient. FGM is an accurate, convenient

process in the lungs associated with high morbidity and mortality. Previous 
research has studied both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions aimed 
at targeting this inflammatory process and improving ventilation. Hypothesis: To 
date, only nonpharmacologic interventions including lung protective ventilation, 
prone positioning, and high positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation 
strategies have resulted in significant improvements in patient outcomes. Given 
the high mortality associated with ARDS despite these advancements, interest in 
subphenotyping has grown, aiming to improve diagnosis and develop personalized 
treatment approaches. Data Collection: Previous trials evaluating pharmacologic 
therapies in heterogeneous populations have primarily demonstrated no positive 
effect, but hope to show benefit when targeting specific subphenotypes, thus 
increasing their efficacy, while simultaneously decreasing adverse effects. 
Results: Although most studies evaluating pharmacologic therapies for ARDS have 
not demonstrated a mortality benefit, there is limited data evaluating 
pharmacologic therapies in ARDS subphenotypes, which have found promising 
results. Neuromuscular blocking agents, corticosteroids, and simvastatin have 
resulted in a mortality benefit when used in patients with the 
hyper-inflammatory ARDS subphenotype. Therapeutic Opinion: The use of 
subphenotyping could revolutionize the way ARDS therapies are applied and 
therefore improve outcomes while also limiting the adverse effects associated 
with their ineffective use. Future studies should evaluate ARDS subphenotypes 
and their response to pharmacologic intervention to advance this area of 
precision medicine.","DOI: 10.1177/08971900231185392

low-titer group O whole blood in children and adolescents.","Gerard J, Mueck K, Lubkin D, Hatton G, Wade C, Cotton B, Brill J, Boukas K, Cox 
C.","BACKGROUND: Low-titer group O whole blood (LTOWB) use has been associated with 
improved survival and less blood transfusions in adult trauma patients. Its use 
in pediatric trauma has been shown to be safe when using leukoreduced, LTOWB 
with anti-A, anti-B antibody titers of <1:50. We set out to evaluate the safety, 
hemostatic potential, and impact on pediatric outcomes at a center using 
non-leukoreduced, LTOWB with anti-A, anti-B antibody titers of <1:200.
METHODS: Patients less than 18 years old, who received emergency-release, 
uncrossed matched blood, and presented to our trauma center from November 2017 
to April 2021 were included. Patients were divided into those receiving any 
LTOWB and those receiving only RBC and or plasma (COMP). Primary outcome was 
30-day survival.
RESULTS: 164 patients received emergency release blood products. Of these, 73 
received at least one unit of LTOWB. The LTOWB group were younger (14 vs 13 yr), 
more likely to be male (87 vs 49%), and to have sustained penetrating trauma (44 
vs 23%); all p < 0.05. LTOWB patients received more blood than their COMP 
counterparts prior to arrival. Serial hemolysis panels (K+, bilirubin, LDH, 
haptoglobin) obtained at 24-hrs, 48-hrs, and 72-hrs were similar between groups; 
all p > 0.05. There was no difference in survival by univariate analysis but 
after adjusting for inverse probability of treatment weights there was an 
observed association between WB administration and improved survival, with an 
odds ratio of 2.48 (1.15-5.47).
CONCLUSION: Non-leukoreduced, LTOWB in anti-A/anti-B antibody titers of <1:200 
appear safe in children and adolescents. While patients receiving LTOWB had more 
evidence of shock, higher torso injury severity, and received more prehospital 
blood products, there may be a mortality benefit with whole blood. Larger, 
multi-center studies are needed.

follicle miniaturization, and novel treatments are needed to intervene in the 
miniaturization process. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
effectiveness, and effective population of autologous hair follicle mesenchymal 
stem cell therapy for the treatment of advanced AGA in Chinese people.
METHODS: 50 patients ranging from 25 to 45 years old, with an average age of 32 
± 1.24 years were included. None of them had ever used minoxidil, finasteride, 
or other drugs to promote hair growth. Healthy hair follicles were extracted 
from the occipital area and treated to obtain hair follicle mesenchymal stem 
cells suspensions. The recipient sites were divided into two groups. Nine points 
were injected in a 1 cm 2 area, and 100 µl of solution containing either 1 × 10 
5 cells or normal saline was injected at each point. The follow-up duration was 
9 months. Observers were blinded to patient groupings and measurements.
RESULTS: An increased proportion of terminal hair and hair shaft diameter was 
observed in the experimental group at 1 month; the effect lasted until 3 months. 
The hair thickening effect of advanced miniaturized hair follicles with hair 
shaft diameter less than 60 µm was more notable than that above 60 µm. None of 
the patients experienced any obvious side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells were effective in the 
treatment of Chinese advanced AGA, and a hair shaft diameter of 60µm can be used 
as a key index to predict the effectiveness of the therapy.","Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on behalf

on maintaining the integrity of the nasal midvault and effecting aesthetic

recurrence, owing to the existence of anatomical blocking points. Blocking 
points are resistant tensile forces that either impede dorsal lowering 
intraoperatively or push the dorsum back to its native convexity over time. Five 
anatomical blocking points have previously been described, which the authors 
expand upon and include an additional two. The seven anatomical blocking points 
are: the cartilaginous septum, perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, lateral 
osteotomy site, Webster's triangle, internal mucoperiosteum of the maxillary 
bone, medial canthal ligament, and the lateral keystone area. It is critical 
that the surgeon be aware of the particular blocking points relevant to his or

common cause of gastroenteritis in the UK. Data collected at broiler farm and 
abattoir level, for slaughter batches that were sampled for UK-wide monitoring, 
were used to generate two epidemiological risk factor models. A total of 483 
batches slaughtered between January 2016 and March 2017 were used in the 
analysis, coming from 19 abattoirs representing more than 85% of UK broiler 
production. For each selected slaughter batch, one carcase was sampled after 
primary chilling and 10 randomly sampled birds had caecal samples collected at 
the evisceration point. Samples were used for Campylobacter identification and 
quantification. Two multivariable mixed-effects models were designed, one with 
the binary outcome for the detection of a highly contaminated (>1000 colony 
forming units (CFU)/g) Campylobacter-positive carcase, whereas the other used 
the Campylobacter colony count (CFU/g) carcase outcome. The results suggest that 
caecal colonization within the batch was a key factor for the occurrence of 
Campylobacter on carcases, and many factors that were identified in the model 
were also likely to be related to colonization or related to the risk of 
introduction of Campylobacter from partial depopulation (referred to as 
thinning) of ~30% of the flock approximately 1 week before full flock 
depopulation events. The amount of neck skin in the sample was another key 
factor identified and was included in both models as a risk factor. The models 
have also identified other factors which may be related to the general health 
and husbandry on-farm (use of prebiotics or vaccines, and identification of the 
product used for drinking line cleaning), whereas the other factors may identify 
control points related to transmission within a farm. The identification of 
these variables could help focus control efforts on-farm, especially for

lymphedema, an antegrade lymphatic to vein flow is usually considered to 
indicate a functional and effective anastomosis. We analyzed the characteristics 
of lymphovenous anastomoses in patients with extremity lymphedema to look for 
the deciding factors of the flow direction.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 45 patients (15 arms and 42 legs) receiving LVA 
for extremity lymphedema were reviewed. Only the anastomoses with 
intraoperatively confirmed patent flow or clear visualization of vessel lumens 
during anastomosis were included for analysis. Multivariate logistic regression 
was used to identify the contributing factors of intraoperative washout 
phenomenon or venous reflux.
RESULTS: A total of 105 eligible LVAs were included for analysis. Anastomosis 
with a more sclerotic lymphatic duct is statistically significantly associated 
with more venous reflux (Odds ratio = 2.82, p = 0.003). Larger diameter 
difference between lymphatic duct and recipient vein (Odds ratio = 12.8, p = 
0.02) and less sclerotic lymphatic duct (Odds ratio = 0.47, p = 0.03) are 
statistically significantly associated with more washout phenomenon.
CONCLUSION: The deciding factors of flow direction in LVA are difference of 
diameters between lymphatic duct and recipient vein, and the severity of

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients undergoing all types

RESULTS: We included 1508 patients who received antibiotic irrigation with

patients). The univariable risk analysis showed a significant decreased risk of 
deep infection using gentamicin irrigation compared with no irrigation (OR 0.58,

Spanish-speaking counterparts (51%). These women perceived that the top three 
barriers to cervical cancer screening were fear of cancer, language, and lack of 
knowledge. The top three perceived facilitators were the doctor's 
recommendation, reminders from the provider's office, and awareness of cervical 
cancer screening.
CONCLUSION: Our work brings unique insights into improving preventive care 
services for Arabic-speaking women. These findings add unique insight focused on 
improving preventive care in this group and can inform interventions to increase 
cancer screening amongst Arabic-speaking women.","DOI: 10.1080/13557858.2023.2224953

medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has raised concerns around 
affordability and access. We examined consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for 
branded versus unbranded generic non-communicable disease (NCD) medicines in 
Kenya.
METHODS: We randomly assigned NCD patients to receive a hypothetical offer for 
either a Novartis Access-branded medicine or for an unbranded generic 
equivalent. We then analysed WTP data captured using a bidding game methodology.
RESULTS: We found that WTP for Novartis Access medicines was on average 23% 
higher than for unbranded generic equivalents (p = 0.009). The WTP brand premium 
was driven almost entirely by wealthier patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the dominance of branded generics in 
LMICs like Kenya reflect in part consumer preferences for these medicines. 
Governments and other health sector actors may be justified in intervening to 
improve access to these medicines and equivalent non-branded generics, 
particularly for the poorest patients who appear to have no preference for 
branded medicines.",© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1002/hpm.3670

detriments from eating, with mood regulation being a salient type of EE 
associated with eating disorders. This study examined the convergent and 
predictive validity of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) mood regulation EE 
items, including mood improvement and mood worsening EE.
METHODS: Thirty women with binge-eating pathology completed a 14-day EMA 
protocol, which included measures of mood regulation EE, affect, appetite, 
appearance- and body-related factors and disordered-eating behaviours.
RESULTS: Greater within-subjects hunger and lower within-subjects positive 
affect and fullness were related to elevated mood improvement EE. Higher 
within-subjects appearance concerns, fullness, body social comparisons and 
thinness pressure were associated with higher mood worsening EE. Greater 
within-subjects mood worsening EE predicted greater likelihood of vomiting at 
the subsequent time point, but there were no within-subjects associations 
between mood improvement EE and behaviours. Yet, greater between-subjects mood 
worsening EE were associated with more restraint/restriction and binge eating, 
and greater between-subjects mood improvement EE were associated with more binge 
eating.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the convergent validity of EMA mood regulation EE 
items. There was limited predictive validity evidence, suggesting complexities 
in how mood regulation EE predict behaviour in daily life.","© 2023 The Authors. European Eating Disorders Review published by Eating

by a variety of neurological insults. It is aimed to elucidate whether a change 
in the expression of PERK-mediated pathway proteins is an indicator of the 
neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia after cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion.
METHODS: One hundred and ninety-two male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 
three groups: a sham group, a cerebral normothermic ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) 
group and a cerebral hypothermic I/R group. A cerebral ischaemia model was 
established by ligating the bilateral common carotid artery for 15 min. Mice in 
the hypothermia group stayed in a cage that was set at 33°C, sprayed with a 
spray of 70% ethanol, and blown with two high-speed fans. The state of neurons 
was assessed on micropreparations stained with haematoxylin-eosin and TUNEL. The 
expressions of GRP78, p-perk, p-eif2α, ATF4 and CHOP were measured by western 
blot analysis 6, 12, 24 and 72 h after reperfusion.
RESULTS: The number of surviving cells was significantly higher in the 
hypothermia group than in the group without hypothermia (p < .05). The GRP78 
expression in the hypothermia group was statistically higher (p < .05) than in 
the ischaemia/reperfusion group. Optical densities of p-perk, p-eif2α and ATF4 
in hippocampus CA1 neurons ischaemia were statistically significantly lower in 
the hypothermia group than in the ischaemia/reperfusion group (p < .05). The 
CHOP expression in the hypothermia group was statistically lower (p < .05) than 
in the ischaemia/reperfusion group.
CONCLUSION: Mild hypothermia for 6 h promoted moderate neuroprotection by 
mediating the expression of GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, ATF4 and CHOP.","© 2023 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

reduce bone resorption that occurs after tooth extraction, facilitating the 
following implant placement. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to 
evaluate the prevalence of mucositis and peri-implantitis around implants 
inserted in sites treated with ARP and to investigate possible risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who received at least one dental implant 
inserted in a grafted socket were considered eligible for this study. Patients 
were recalled for a follow-up visit; medical history, clinical and demographic 
data were collected. Univariate logistic regression analyses have been performed 
for both implant-level and patient-level variables. Indeed, moderation analysis 
was used to investigate the indirect relationship between age and marginal bone 
level.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients who received 61 implants were enrolled in this 
cross-sectional study. Thirty-three implants were classified as ""healthy"" 
(54.1%), 23 implants showed signs of peri-implant mucositis (37.7%), and 5 
implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis (8.2%). Data analyzed at the 
patient level showed that 49% of the patients were healthy, 45.1% of the 
patients had mucositis and 5.9% of the patients were affected by 
peri-implantitis. Mandibular sites and type III grafted sockets showed a 
significant association with peri-implantitis; in addition, a history of 
periodontitis and an increase in age showed higher risks of developing mucositis 
or peri-implantitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Implants inserted in grafted sockets showed favorable rates of 
healthy implants in the long term.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The ridge preservation procedures do not seem to increase 
the risk of developing mucositis or peri-implantitis.","© 2023 The Authors. Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research published by

common, associated with reduced quality of life and effective interventions 
exist. There are knowledge gaps concerning FCR among long-term, early-stage BCSs 
and its associations with other late effects. Within a national cohort, we 
explored these knowledge gaps, with the ultimate aim of improved care for BCSs 
experiencing long-term FCR.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all BCSs aged 20-65 years with 
early-stage breast cancer in 2011-2012 (n = 2803), were identified by the Cancer 
Registry of Norway in 2019 and mailed a survey including the Assessment of 
Survivor Concerns used to measure FCR. Factors associated with moderate/high FCR 
(defined as a sum score of ≥ 6 of a possible range 3-12, or a single score on 
one of the items of ≥ 3) were explored using a three-block regression analyses 
including relevant sociodemographic-, health- and cancer-related variables.
RESULTS: In total, 1311 BCSs were included (47%). Median age at survey was 
60 years. Fifty-six % reported moderate-to-high FCR, associated with younger age 
(OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.97) and receiving chemo- and endocrine therapy (OR 1.59, 
95% CI 1.15-2.20). After adding late effects into the model, FCR remained 
significantly associated with these variables, in addition to sleep disturbances 
(OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.18-2.10). In the final block, adding mental distress, FCR 
remained significantly associated with younger age (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99), 
receiving chemo- and endocrine therapy (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.97), sleep 
disturbances (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08-1.94) and anxiety (OR 2.67, 95% CI 
1.38-5.19).
CONCLUSIONS: FCR was prevalent eight years after early-stage breast cancer. 
Being younger, receiving intensive treatment, experiencing sleep disturbances 
and/or anxiety were associated with moderate/high FCR. Addressing FCR should be 
part of standard follow-up care of long-term BCSs.","DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2023.2224052

analysis of the target chemical, and the development of an analytical model can 
be improved by studying its characteristics and rules. In the present study, the 
electronic excitation characteristics of phosphate anions (H2PO4-, HPO42-, and 
PO43-) were analyzed based on the charge-transfer spectrum. In addition, the 
absorption spectra of phosphate anions at the energy level of PBE0/6-311+G (d,p) 
were recorded based on the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) 
method. Different (HPO42-)n·(H2O)10-n molecular clusters were theoretically 
constructed, and the combined TD-DFT method and independent gradient model 
revealed that red shift of the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) with the 
increase of phosphate anion concentration (0-10 mM) may be caused by the 
decrease of hydrogen bond interaction. In addition, the prominent dispersion in 
the short-wave region mainly resulted in the red shift of λmax with the increase 
in optical path length (1-100 mm). Moreover, with the increase in spectral 
bandwidth (0.4-3.0 nm), λmax slightly blue-shifted because of the increase in 
energy through the slit, and repeatability of the corresponding absorbance 
measurement at λmax gradually improved. As the spectral bandwidth increased, 
light monochromaticity became poor, resulting in the decrease of the linearly 
fitted correlation coefficient of the concentration-absorbance curve. Finally, 
the multivariate analysis of variance results showed that the optical path 
length was the most significant factor that influenced the absorption spectral 
characteristics of phosphate anions. This study provides a basis for the 
qualitative and quantitative analysis of phosphate anions by using absorption 
spectra and also renders a theoretical reference for absorption spectroscopy of 
other chemicals.","DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00847

However, this adjustment can be extremely stressful for patients and their 
families as they transition from cancer patient to survivor. A better 
understanding of the patient and family experience and their needs during this 
transition is crucial for developing guidelines and leveraging support for 
future patients and families.
PROCEDURE: Participants were recruited from across the United States using a 
maximum variation sampling strategy. Families were eligible if they had a child 
diagnosed with cancer before age 15 and had completed treatment at least 1 year 
prior to their interview. Participants completed a 90-180-minute semi-structured 
interview either in person or virtually. Interviews focused on the experiences 
of getting a diagnosis, experiences with treatment, information seeking, impact 
of cancer on the family, social support, and transitions to survivorship. 
Inductive thematic analysis revealed a wide variety of themes. This paper 
examines the transition from active cancer therapy into survivorship.
RESULTS: Identified primary themes included (i) feelings about transitioning off 
therapy; (ii) coping with lingering effects; and (iii) experiences of 
transitioning off therapy and survivorship care. Subthemes highlighted the need 
for more support for both patients and families during this transition.
CONCLUSION: Patients and families desire more support during the transition off 
therapy. Suggestions included access to additional resources, earlier transition 
to receiving survivorship care, and more holistic survivorship care. Further 
research is needed to determine best models and feasibility of delivering this

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: CEUS LI-RADS (Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Liver Imaging Reporting 
and Data System) has good diagnostic efficacy for differentiating hepatic 
carcinoma (HCC) from solid malignant tumors. However, it can be problematic in 
patients with both chronic hepatitis B and extrahepatic primary malignancy. We 
explored the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS criteria and CEUS-based machine 
learning (ML) models in such patients.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with hepatitis and HCC or liver metastasis (LM) 
who were included in a multicenter liver cancer database between July 2017 and 
January 2022 were enrolled in this study. LI-RADS and enhancement features were 
assessed in a training cohort, and ML models were constructed using gradient 
boosting, random forest, and generalized linear models. The diagnostic 
performance of the ML models was compared with LI-RADS in a validation cohort of 
patients with both chronic hepatitis and extrahepatic malignancy.
RESULTS: The mild washout time was adjusted to 54 s from 60 s, increasing 
accuracy from 76.8 to 79.4%. Through feature screening, washout type II, rim 
enhancement and unclear border were identified as the top three predictor 
variables. Using LI-RADS to differentiate HCC from LM, the sensitivity, 
specificity, and AUC were 68.2%, 88.6%, and 0.784, respectively. In comparison, 
the random forest and generalized linear model both showed significantly higher 
sensitivity and accuracy than LI-RADS (0.83 vs. 0.784; all P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with LI-RADS, the random forest and generalized linear 
model had higher accuracy for differentiating HCC from LM in patients with 
chronic hepatitis B and extrahepatic malignancy.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40644-023-00573-8

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Sustained yet intractable immunosuppression is commonly observed in 
septic patients, resulting in aggravated clinical outcomes. However, due to the 
substantial heterogeneity within septic patients, precise indicators in 
deciphering clinical trajectories and immunological alterations for septic 
patients remain largely lacking.
METHODS: We adopted cross-species, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
analysis based on two published datasets containing circulating immune cell 
profile of septic patients as well as immune cell atlas of murine model of 
sepsis. Flow cytometry, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging and 
Western blotting were applied to identify the presence of S100A9+ monocytes at 
protein level. To interrogate the immunosuppressive function of this subset, 
splenic monocytes isolated from septic wild-type or S100a9-/- mice were 
co-cultured with naïve CD4+ T cells, followed by proliferative assay. 
Pharmacological inhibition of S100A9 was implemented using Paquinimod via oral 
gavage.
RESULTS: ScRNA-seq analysis of human sepsis revealed substantial heterogeneity 
in monocyte compartments following the onset of sepsis, for which distinct 
monocyte subsets were enriched in disparate subclusters of septic patients. We 
identified a unique monocyte subset characterized by high expression of S100A 
family genes and low expression of human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), which 
were prominently enriched in septic patients and might exert immunosuppressive 
function. By combining single-cell transcriptomics of murine model of sepsis 
with in vivo experiments, we uncovered a similar subtype of monocyte 
significantly associated with late sepsis and immunocompromised status of septic 
mice, corresponding to HLA-DRlowS100Ahigh monocytes in human sepsis. Moreover, 
we found that S100A9+ monocytes exhibited profound immunosuppressive function on 
CD4+ T cell immune response and blockade of S100A9 using Paquinimod could 
partially reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies HLA-DRlowS100Ahigh monocytes correlated with 
immunosuppressive state upon septic challenge, inhibition of which can markedly 
mitigate sepsis-induced immune depression, thereby providing a novel therapeutic 
strategy for the management of sepsis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40779-023-00462-y

increased mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation. The canonical 
GH-GHR-IGFs axis in liver exhibits a great complexity in response to somatic 
growth. However, the underlying mechanism of whether local GHR acts as a control 
valve to regulate mitochondrial function through mitochondrial biogenesis during 
myoblast differentiation remains unknown.
METHODS: We manipulated the GHR expression in chicken primary myoblast to 
investigate its roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and function during myoblast 
differentiation.
RESULTS: We reported that GHR is induced during myoblast differentiation. Local 
GHR promoted mitochondrial biogenesis during myoblast differentiation, as 
determined by the fluorescence intensity of Mito-Tracker Green staining and 
MitoTimer reporter system, the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers 
(PGC1α, NRF1, TFAM) and mtDNA encoded gene (ND1, CYTB, COX1, ATP6), as well as 
mtDNA content. Consistently, local GHR enhanced mitochondrial function during 
myoblast differentiation, as determined by the oxygen consumption rate, 
mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP level and ROS production. We next revealed 
that the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function by GHR depends on 
IGF1. In terms of the underlying mechanism, we demonstrated that IGF1 regulates 
mitochondrial biogenesis via PI3K/AKT/CREB pathway. Additionally, GHR knockdown 
repressed myoblast differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data corroborate that local GHR acts as a 
control valve to enhance mitochondrial function by promoting mitochondrial 
biogenesis via IGF1-PI3K/AKT/CREB pathway during myoblast differentiation. Video

complete response (pCR) rates in HER2-positive breast cancer, yet effects on 
long-term survival have been limited and it is uncertain which patients derive 
most benefit. In this study, we determine the prognostic value of BluePrint 
subtyping in HER2-positive breast cancer. Additionally, we evaluate its use as a 
biomarker for predicting response to trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy with or without pertuzumab.
METHODS: From a cohort of patients with stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer 
who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab with or without 
pertuzumab, 836 patients were selected for microarray gene expression analysis, 
followed by readout of BluePrint standard (HER2, Basal and Luminal) and dual 
subtypes (HER2-single, Basal-single, Luminal-single, HER2-Basal, Luminal-HER2, 
Luminal-HER2-Basal). The associations between subtypes and pathological complete 
response (pCR), overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) 
were assessed, and pertuzumab benefit was evaluated within the BluePrint 
subgroups.
RESULTS: BluePrint results were available for 719 patients. In patients with 
HER2-type tumors, the pCR rate was 71.9% in patients who received pertuzumab 
versus 43.5% in patients who did not (adjusted Odds Ratio 3.43, 95% CI 
2.36-4.96). Additionally, a significantly decreased hazard was observed for both 
OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.80) and BCSS (aHR 0.46, 95% 
CI 0.24-0.86) with pertuzumab treatment. Findings were similar in the 
HER2-single subgroup. No significant benefit of pertuzumab was seen in other 
subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HER2-type or HER2-single-type tumors, pertuzumab 
significantly improved the pCR rate and decreased the risk of breast cancer 
mortality, which was not observed in other subtypes. BluePrint subtyping may be 
valuable in future studies to identify patients that are likely to be highly 
sensitive to HER2-targeting agents.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13058-023-01664-x

tendency to rupture. The drug treatment for small AAA without surgical 
indications has been controversial. Previous studies showed that 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) had become a potential biomarker of 
the disease, and the anti-inflammatory effect of rivaroxaban for AAA had been 
well established. Thus, we hypothesized that rivaroxaban could control the 
progression of AAA in patients with hs-CRP elevation.
METHODS: The study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical 
trial. Sixty subjects are recruited from the General Hospital of Northern 
Theatre Command of China. Subjects are randomly assigned (1:1) to the 
intervention arm (rivaroxaban) or control arm (aspirin). The primary efficacy 
outcome is the level of serum hs-CRP at 6 months. The secondary outcomes include 
imaging examination (the maximal diameter of AAA, the maximal thickness of mural 
thrombus, and the length of aneurysm), major adverse cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular events (MACCE, including AAA transformation, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction, acute congestive heart failure, stent thrombosis, 
ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, vascular amputation, stroke, 
cardiovascular death, and all-cause death), and other laboratory tests (troponin 
T, interleukin 6, D-dimer, and coagulation function).
DISCUSSION: The BANBOO trial tested the effect of rivaroxaban on the progression 
of AAA in patients with elevated Hs-CRP for the first time.

not all reads associated with one cell barcode originate from the encapsulated 
cell. Such background noise is attributed to spillage from cell-free ambient RNA 
or barcode swapping events.
RESULTS: Here, we characterize this background noise exemplified by three 
scRNA-seq and two snRNA-seq replicates of mouse kidneys. For each experiment, 
cells from two mouse subspecies are pooled, allowing to identify cross-genotype 
contaminating molecules and thus profile background noise. Background noise is 
highly variable across replicates and cells, making up on average 3-35% of the 
total counts (UMIs) per cell and we find that noise levels are directly 
proportional to the specificity and detectability of marker genes. In search of 
the source of background noise, we find multiple lines of evidence that the 
majority of background molecules originates from ambient RNA. Finally, we use 
our genotype-based estimates to evaluate the performance of three methods 
(CellBender, DecontX, SoupX) that are designed to quantify and remove background 
noise. We find that CellBender provides the most precise estimates of background 
noise levels and also yields the highest improvement for marker gene detection. 
By contrast, clustering and classification of cells are fairly robust towards 
background noise and only small improvements can be achieved by background 
removal that may come at the cost of distortions in fine structure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings help to better understand the extent, sources and 
impact of background noise in single-cell experiments and provide guidance on 
how to deal with it.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13059-023-02978-x

depends on agriculture for their livelihoods. To increase the productivity and 
sustainability of their farms, they need access to affordable yield-enhancing 
inputs of which parasite control is of paramount importance. We therefore 
determined the status of current tick species with the highest economic impact 
on cattle by sampling representative numbers of animals in each of seven 
sub-Saharan countries.
METHODS: Data included tick species' half-body counts from approximately 120 
cattle at each of two districts per country, collected four times in 
approximately 1 year (to include seasonality). Study sites were chosen in each 
country to include high cattle density and tick burden.
RESULTS: East Africa (Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania) showed overall a higher 
diversity and prevalence in tick infestations compared to West African countries 
(Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Nigeria). In East Africa, Amblyomma variegatum 
(vector of Ehrlichia ruminantium), Rhipicephalus microplus (Babesia bovis, B. 
bigemina, Anaplasma marginale), R. evertsi evertsi (A. marginale) and R. 
appendiculatus (Theileria parva) were the most prevalent tick species of 
economic importance. While the latter species was absent in West Africa, here 
both A. variegatum and R. microplus occurred in high numbers. Rhipicephalus 
microplus had spread to Uganda, infesting half of the cattle sampled. 
Rhipicephalus appendiculatus is known for its invasive behaviour and 
displacement of other blue tick species, as observed in other East and West 
African countries. Individual cattle with higher body weights, as well as males, 
were more likely to be infested. For six tick species, we found reduced 
infestation levels when hosts were treated with anti-parasiticides.
CONCLUSIONS: These baseline data allow the determination of possible changes in 
presence and prevalence of ticks in each of the countries targeted, which is of 
importance in the light of human-caused climate and habitat alterations or 
anthropogenic activities. As many of the ticks in this study are vectors of 
important pathogens, but also, as cattle may act as end hosts for ticks of 
importance to human health, our study will help a wide range of stakeholders to 
provide recommendations for tick infestation surveillance and prevention.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13071-023-05801-5

emergency, affecting a younger population than individuals experiencing an 
ischemic stroke; aSAH is associated with a high risk of mortality and permanent 
disability. The noble gas xenon has been shown to possess neuroprotective 
properties as demonstrated in numerous preclinical animal studies. In addition, 
a recent study demonstrated that xenon could attenuate a white matter injury 
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS: The study is a prospective, multicenter phase II clinical drug trial. 
The study design is a single-blind, prospective superiority randomized two-armed 
parallel follow-up study. The primary objective of the study is to explore the 
potential neuroprotective effects of inhaled xenon, when administered within 6 h 
after the onset of symptoms of aSAH. The primary endpoint is the extent of the 
global white matter injury assessed with magnetic resonance diffusion tensor 
imaging of the brain.
DISCUSSION: Despite improvements in medical technology and advancements in 
medical science, aSAH mortality and disability rates have remained nearly 
unchanged for the past 10 years. Therefore, new neuroprotective strategies to 
attenuate the early and delayed brain injuries after aSAH are needed to reduce 
morbidity and mortality.

and World Health Organization top priority pathogen. Infection leads to an often 
fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in humans. The tick-borne virus is endemic in 
countries across Asia, Europe and Africa, with signs of spreading into new 
regions. Despite the severity of disease and the potential of CCHFV geographic 
expansion to cause widespread outbreaks, no approved vaccine or treatment is 
currently available. Critical for basic research and the development of 
diagnostics or medical countermeasures, CCHFV viral stocks are commonly produced 
in Vero E6 and SW-13 cell lines. While a variety of in-house methods are being 
used across different laboratories, there has been no clear, specific consensus 
on a standard, optimal system for CCHFV growth and titration. In this study, we 
perform a systematic, side-by-side characterization of Vero E6 and SW-13 cell 
lines concerning the replication kinetics of CCHFV under different culture 
conditions. SW-13 cells are typically cultured in a CO2-free condition (SW-13 
CO2-) according to the American Type Culture Collection. However, we identify a 
CO2-compatible culture condition (SW-13 CO2+) that demonstrates the highest 
viral load (RNA concentration) and titer (infectious virus concentration) in the 
culture supernatants, in comparison to SW-13 CO2- and Vero E6 cultures. This 
optimal viral propagation system also leads to the development of two titration 
methods: an immunostaining-based plaque assay using a commercial CCHFV antibody 
and a colorimetric readout, and an antibody staining-free, cytopathic 
effect-based median tissue culture infectious dose assay using a simple excel 
calculator. These are anticipated to serve as a basis for a reproducible, 
standardized and user-friendly platform for CCHFV propagation and titration.",© 2023. Crown.,"DOI: 10.1186/s12985-023-02089-w

decision-making skills, new learning tools are constantly developed. Virtual 
reality (VR) is one of the emerging technologies with the potential to improve 
health professionals' education. Highly realistic learning experiences with 
repeatable training scenarios can be created within a protected environment that 
is independent from real patients' presence. Our project ""medical tr.AI.ning"" is 
following this approach aiming to simulate immersive virtual first-person 
scenarios with intelligent, interactable virtual patients. So far, VR has been 
mainly used in surgical training, but there is evidence for effectiveness in 
training different procedural skills, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 
knowledge acquisition, and improvement of reasoning and creativity, while still 
being cost-effective. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the 
usage and identify key areas of VR applications in the field of medical 
education. Furthermore, the corresponding requirements, evaluation methods and 
outcomes, advantages, and disadvantages will be covered.
METHODS: This scoping review protocol implements the updated JBI Scoping Review 
Methodology. In March 2022, a preliminary literature research in PubMed was 
performed by two independent reviewers to refine search terms and strategy as 
well as inclusion criteria of the protocol, accounting for actuality and 
scientific relevance. The final search will be conducted using PubMed, 
ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and JBI 
Evidence Synthesis. Search, study screening, and data extraction will be done in 
parallel and independently by two reviewers. Discrepancies will be handled by 
consensus or consulting a third review author.
DISCUSSION: With this scoping review, we anticipate collating the range of 
application of VR in medical education while using a transparent and 
reproducible search strategy. This may contribute to the design and development 
of novel educational VR platforms and their integration into medical curricula 
while pointing out previous omissions and pitfalls.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13643-023-02266-6

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Chronic refractory wounds easily relapse and seriously affect the 
patients' quality of life. Previous studies have shown that stromal vascular 
fraction gel (SVF-gel) significantly promotes the early healing of chronic 
wounds; however, the mechanisms of SVF-gel function per se remain unclear, and a 
long-term follow-up is lacking. This study aims to explore the mechanisms of 
SVF-gel promoting the healing of chronic wounds and follow up the long-term 
efficacy of SVF-gel.
METHODS: Autologous SVF-gel transplantation was performed in 20 patients with 
chronic wounds (from March 2016 to September 2019), and the size of the wound 
before and after SVF-gel transplantation was observed. The conditioned medium 
(CM) was harvested from SVF-gel under serum-free, serum-deprivation and 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS) microenvironment in vitro, respectively. The 
concentration of the growth factors in the two kinds of gel-CM was tested, and 
their effects on the proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblasts 
(HDFs) were detected.
RESULTS: All patients had 100% wound closure eventually, and the average time to 
complete closure was 28.3 ± 9.7 days. The time of follow-up ranged from 2 to 6 
years, and there was no wound recurrence. Interestingly, the concentrations of 
epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor β1 of the CM were higher 
in serum-free and serum-deprivation condition than in 10% FBS microenvironment 
(p < 0.05). Correspondingly, the proliferation and migration ability of HDFs 
treated with gel-CM from serum-free condition were stronger than those treated 
with gel-CM from serum-deprivation (2% FBS) or 10% FBS microenvironment 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that it is safe, effective, and lasting in 
effect to treat chronic wounds with SVF-gel and mechanisms of action that 
include secreting various cytokines and promoting cell proliferation and 
migration ability.

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS), one of the most challenging clinical 
problems in congenital heart disease, leads to secondary pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy. Due to the lack of a 
rodent model, the mechanisms underlying PVS and its associated secondary effects 
are largely unknown, and treatments are minimally successful. This study 
developed a neonatal rat PVS model with the aim of increasing our understanding 
of the mechanisms and developing possible treatments for PVS.
METHODS: PVS was created at postnatal day 1 (P1) by banding pulmonary veins that 
receive blood from the right anterior and mid lobes. The condition was confirmed 
using echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), gross anatomic examination, 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, fibrosis staining, and immunofluorescence. 
Lung and RV remodeling under the condition of PVS were evaluated using H&E 
staining, fibrosis staining, and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: At P21, echocardiography revealed a change in wave form and a decrease 
in pulmonary artery acceleration time-indicators of PAH-at the transpulmonary 
valve site in the PVS group. CT at P21 showed a decrease in pulmonary vein 
diameter in the PVS group. At P30 in the PVS group, gross anatomic examination 
showed pulmonary congestion, H&E staining showed wall thickening and lumen 
narrowing in the upstream pulmonary veins, and immunofluorescence showed an 
increase in the smooth muscle layers in the upstream pulmonary veins. In 
addition, at P30 in the PVS group, lung remodeling was evidenced by hyperemia, 
thickening of pulmonary small vessel walls and smooth muscle layers, and 
reduction of the number of alveoli. RV remodeling was evidenced by an increase 
in RV free wall thickness.
CONCLUSIONS: A neonatal rat model of PVS was successfully established, showing 
secondary lung and RV remodeling. This model may serve as a useful platform for 
understanding the mechanisms and treatments for PVS.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13578-023-01058-8

characterized by selective degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. The 
pathogenesis of ALS remains largely unknown; however, inflammation of the spinal 
cord is a focus of ALS research and an important pathogenic process in ALS. 
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a major lipid mediator generated by the 
arachidonic-acid cascade and is abundant at inflammatory sites. PGE2 levels are 
increased in the postmortem spinal cords of ALS patients and in ALS model mice. 
Beneficial therapeutic effects have been obtained in ALS model mice using 
cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors to inhibit the biosynthesis of PGE2, but the 
usefulness of this inhibitor has not yet been proven in clinical trials. In this 
review, we present current evidence on the involvement of PGE2 in the 
progression of ALS and discuss the potential of microsomal prostaglandin E 
synthase (mPGES) and the prostaglandin receptor E-prostanoid (EP) 2 as 
therapeutic targets for ALS. Signaling pathways involving prostaglandin 
receptors mediate toxic effects in the central nervous system. In some 
situations, however, the receptors mediate neuroprotective effects. Our recent 
studies demonstrated that levels of mPGES-1, which catalyzes the final step of 
PGE2 biosynthesis, are increased at the early-symptomatic stage in the spinal 
cords of transgenic ALS model mice carrying the G93A variant of superoxide 
dismutase-1. In addition, in an experimental motor-neuron model used in studies 
of ALS, PGE2 induces the production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent 
caspase-3-dependent cytotoxicity through activation of the EP2 receptor. 
Moreover, this PGE2-induced EP2 up-regulation in motor neurons plays a role in 
the death of motor neurons in ALS model mice. Further understanding of the 
pathophysiological role of PGE2 in neurodegeneration may provide new insights to 
guide the development of novel therapies for ALS.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40035-023-00366-w

usually more oriented to evaluate patient's present status, than to plan 
interventions according to predicted outcomes. Therefore, we conducted an 
extensive review of current prognostic models available in the literature for 
recovery prediction of many functions and constructs, after stroke. We reported 
results in the form of a practical guide for clinicians, with the aim of 
promoting the culture of early clinical assessment for patient stratification, 
according to expected outcome. To define a roadmap for clinicians, a stepwise 
sequence of five actions has been developed, from collecting information of past 
medical history to the adoption of validated prediction tools. Furthermore, a 
clinically-oriented organization of available prediction tools for recovery 
after stroke have been proposed for motor, language, physiological and 
independency functions. Finally, biomarkers and online resources with prognostic 
value have been reviewed, to give the most updated state of the art on 
prediction tools after stroke.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinical assessment should be directed 
both towards the objective evaluation of the present health status, and to the 
prediction of expected recovery. The use of specific outcome measures with 
predictive value is recommended to help clinicians with the definition of sound 
therapeutic goals.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40945-023-00167-4

pesticides, most of which have not been effectively studied for their influence 
on a susceptible group of population involving infants and pregnant females. 
Rotenone is an organic pesticide used to prepare Parkinson's disease models. A 
lot of literature is available on the toxicity of rotenone on the adult brain, 
but to the best of our knowledge, effect of rotenone on prenatally exposed mice 
has never been investigated yet. Therefore, the recent work aims to evaluate the 
toxic effect of rotenone on mice, exposed prenatally. We exposed female mice to 
rotenone at the dose of 5 mg/Kg b.w. throughout the gestational period with oral 
gavage. We then investigated the effects of rotenone on neonate's central 
nervous systems as well as on postnatal day (PD) 35 offspring. In the rotenone 
group, we observed slow physical growth, delays in physical milestones and 
sensorimotor reflex in neonates and induction of anxiety and impairment in 
cognitive performances of offspring at PD-35. Additionally, immunohistochemical 
analysis revealed a marked reduction in TH-positive neurons in substantia nigra. 
Histological examination of the cerebellum revealed a decrease in Purkinje 
neurons in the rotenone exposed group as compared to the control. The data from 
the study showed that prenatally exposure to rotenone affects growth, physical 
milestones, neuronal population and behaviour of mice when indirectly exposed to 
the offspring through their mother. This study could provide a great

across global populations. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), distinct environmental 
determinants may influence development and progression of atherosclerotic 
coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: We investigated associations between 6 established markers of 
myocardial stress and subsequent subclinical CAD (sCAD), defined as presence of 
any atherosclerosis on coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in a 2-year prospective 
cohort of Ugandan adults enriched for cardiometabolic risk factors (RFs) and 
HIV. Six plasma biomarkers were measured baseline among 200 participants (50% 
with HIV) aged ≥ 45 years with ≥ 1 cardiovascular RF. At 2-year follow-up, 132 
participants (52% with HIV) who returned underwent coronary CCTA.
RESULTS: In logistic regression models adjusted for cardiovascular RFs (age, 
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity) and non-traditional 
RFs (HIV, chronic kidney disease), only NT-proBNP predicted subsequent 
subclinical CAD (p < 0.008, Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). In 
sensitivity analyses adjusted for ASCVD risk category (instead of individual 
RFs) in the baseline cohort with multiple imputation applied to missing year 2 
CCTA data (n = 200), NT-proBNP remained significantly associated with subsequent 
CAD (p < 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP consistently predicted subclinical CAD in Uganda in the 
absence of such an association among other markers of myocardial stress, 
suggesting a role for NT-proBNP in atherosclerosis independently of coronary

were measured using a flow cytometer (FCM) or fluorescent staining. Calcium ion 
(Ca2+) concentration was quantified by Fluo-3 AM staining. Athymic nude mice 
were modeled with subcutaneous xenografts.
RESULTS: Oridonin inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of 
colorectal cancer, and this effect was weakened in a concentration-dependent 
manner by ER stress inhibitors. In addition, oridonin-induced colorectal tumor 
cells showed increased expression of ER stress biomarkers, loose morphology of 
ER, increased vesicles, and irregular shape. TCF4 was identified as a regulator 
of ER stress by PWMs software and GEO survival analysis. In vitro and in vivo 
experiments confirmed that TCF4 inhibited ER stress, reduced ROS production, and 
maintained Ca2+ homeostasis. In addition, oridonin also activated TP53 and 
inhibited TCF4 transactivation, further exacerbating the elevated ROS levels and 
calcium ion release in tumor cells and inhibiting tumorigenesis in colorectal 
cancer cells in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Oridonin upregulated TP53, inhibited TCF4 transactivation, and 
induced ER stress dysregulation in tumor cells, promoting colorectal cancer cell 
death. Therefore, TCF4 may be one of the important nodes for tumor cells to 
regulate ER stress and maintain protein synthesis homeostasis. And the 
inhibition of the TP53/TCF4 axis plays a key role in the anti-cancer effects of 
oridonin.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13046-023-02702-4

and reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive Ca2+-permeable cation channel has a 
vital role in surviving the cell as well as defending the adaptability of 
various cell groups during and after oxidative stress. It shows higher 
expression in several cancers involving breast, pancreatic, prostate, melanoma, 
leukemia, and neuroblastoma, indicating it raises the survivability of cancerous 
cells. In various cancers including gastric cancers, and neuroblastoma, TRPM2 is 
known to conserve viability, and several underlying mechanisms of action have 
been proposed. Transcription factors are thought to activate TRPM2 channels, 
which is essential for cell proliferation and survival. In normal physiological 
conditions with an optimal expression of TRPM2, mitochondrial ROS is produced in 
optimal amounts while regulation of antioxidant expression is carried on. 
Depletion of TRPM2 overexpression or activity has been shown to improve 
ischemia-reperfusion injury in organ levels, reduce tumor growth and/or 
viability of various malignant cancers like breast, gastric, pancreatic, 
prostate, head and neck cancers, melanoma, neuroblastoma, T-cell and acute 
myelogenous leukemia. This updated and comprehensive review also analyzes the 
mechanisms by which TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ signaling can regulate the growth and 
survival of different types of cancer cells. Based on the discussion of the 
available data, it can be concluded that TRPM2 may be a unique therapeutic 
target in the treatment of several types of cancer. Video Abstract.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12964-023-01149-6

colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which 
the natural product Scutellaria baicalensis (Huang Qin; HQ) and one of its main 
components baicalin enhanced 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) antitumor activity against 
CRC. Cell proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis, reverse-phase protein array 
(RPPA) analysis, immunoblot analysis, and qRT-PCR were performed to investigate 
the mechanism(s) of action of HQ and its active components on growth of CRC 
cells. HQ exhibited in vitro antiproliferative activity against drug resistant 
human CRC cells, against human and mouse CRC cells with different genetic 
backgrounds and normal human colon epithelial cells. In vivo animal models were 
used to document the antitumor activity of HQ and baicalin. The mechanism of 
growth inhibitory activity of HQ is due to inhibition of proliferative signaling 
pathways including the CDK-RB pathway. In addition, HQ enhanced the antitumor 
effects of 5-FU and capecitabine in vivo. Furthermore, we identified baicalin as 
an active component of HQ. The combination of baicalin and 5-FU demonstrated 
synergistic activity against 5-FU-resistant RKO-R10 cells. The combination 
significantly inhibited in vivo tumor growth greater than each treatment alone. 
RPPA results showed that the signaling pathway alterations in CRC cells were 
similar following HQ and baicalin treatment. Together, these results indicate 
that HQ and its component baicalin enhance the effect of 5-fluorouracil-based 
chemotherapy via inhibition of CDK-RB pathway. These findings may provide the 
rational basis for developing agents that can overcome the development of 
cellular drug resistance. Video Abstract.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12964-023-01156-7

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify the degree of lumbar spinal 
stenosis by assessing the anterior and posterior vertebral canal diameter and 
dural area, determine the sensitivity of the anterior and posterior spinal canal 
diameter, dural area and dural occupying rate in predicting the postoperative 
efficacy of oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) for patients with 
single-stage lumbar spinal stenosis, and identify the corresponding indicators 
suggesting that OLIF surgery should not be performed.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of patients who had previously undergone 
OLIF surgery in our hospital, we included a total of 104 patients with lumbar 
spinal stenosis who had previously undergone single-stage surgery in our 
hospital. Three independent observers were employed to measure the anterior and 
posterior diameter of the spinal canal (AD, mm), dural area (CSA, mm2), the 
spinal canal area (SCA, mm2), and the ratio of the dural area to the spinal 
canal area (DM, %) at the disc level with the most severe stenosis on MRI. 
According to the values of AD and CSA in preoperative MRI, patients were divided 
into three groups: A, B, and C (Group A: AD > 12 and 100 < CSA ≤ 130, group B: 
Except A and C, group C: AD ≤ 10 and CSA ≤ 75). Preoperative and postoperative 
clinical outcome scores (Japanese Orthopaedic Association [JOA] score, VAS 
score, modified Macnab standard) of 104 patients were statistically.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in the preoperative and 
postoperative clinical correlation scores among the mild, moderate and severe 
lumbar spinal stenosis groups. The improvement rate of the post treatment JOA 
score, the difference between the preoperative and postoperative VAS score, and 
the modified Macnab standard were compared pairwise. There was no statistical 
significance in the improvement rate of the post treatment JOA score, the 
difference between the preoperative and postoperative VAS score, and the 
modified Macnab standard between Group A and Group B (P = 0.125, P = 0.620, 
P = 0.803). There were statistically significant differences between Group A and 
Group C and between Group B and Group C in the improvement rate of the JOA 
score, the difference in the pre- and postoperative VAS score, and the modified 
Macnab standard. The anterior and posterior vertebral canal diameter and dural 
area are sensitive predictors of the postoperative efficacy of OLIF surgery for 
single-stage lumbar spinal stenosis. Moreover, when the anterior and posterior 
vertebral canal diameter was less than 6.545 mm and the dural area was less than 
34.43 mm2, the postoperative effect of OLIF surgery was poor.
CONCLUSIONS: All the patients with mild, moderate, and severe lumbar spinal 
stenosis achieved curative effects after OLIF surgery. Patients with mild and 
moderate lumbar spinal stenosis had better curative effects, and there was no 
significant difference between them, while patients with severe lumbar spinal 
stenosis had poor curative effects. Both the anteroposterior diameter of the 
spinal canal and the dural area of the spinal canal were sensitive in predicting 
the curative effect of OLIF surgery for single-stage lumbar spinal stenosis. 
When the anterior and posterior vertebral canal diameter was less than 6.545 mm 
and the dural area was less than 34.43 mm2, the postoperative effect of OLIF

suggested for its expression during the normal sperm development although its 
conditional deletion caused no apparent abnormalities. Since we established our 
original transgenic mouse system that enabled labeling of past and ongoing 
Notch1 signaling at a cellular level, we tried to validate that observation in 
vivo. Our transgenic mouse system used Cre/loxP system to induce tandem dsRed 
expression upon Notch1 signaling.
RESULTS: To our surprise, we were unable to observe tandem dsRed expression in 
the seminiferous tubules where the sperms developed. In addition, tandem dsRed 
expression was lacking in the somatic cells of the next generation in our 
transgenic mouse system, suggesting that sperms received no Notch1 signaling 
during their development. To validate this result, we conducted re-analysis of 
four single-cell RNA-seq datasets from mouse and human testes and showed that 
Notch1 expression was little in the sperm cell lineage. Collectively, our 
results posed a question into the involvement of Notch1 in the normal sperm 
development although this observation may help the interpretation of the 
previous result that Notch1 conditional deletion caused no apparent 
abnormalities in murine spermatogenesis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13104-023-06378-z

and contributes to metabolic and neuropathological abnormalities during brain 
aging. To provide insights into whether APOE4 genotype is related to 
tau-associated neurodegeneration, we have generated human P301S mutant tau 
transgenic mice (PS19) that carry humanized APOE alleles (APOE2, APOE3 or 
APOE4). In aging mice that succumbed to paralysis, PS19 mice homozygous for 
APOE3 had the longest lifespan when compared to APOE4 and APOE2 homozygous mice 
(APOE3 > APOE4 ~ APOE2). Heterozygous mice with one human APOE and one mouse 
Apoe allele did not show any variations in lifespan. At end-stage, PS19 mice 
homozygous for APOE3 and APOE4 showed equivalent levels of phosphorylated tau 
burden, inflammation levels and ventricular volumes. Compared to these cohorts, 
PS19 mice homozygous for APOE2 showed lower induction of phosphorylation on 
selective epitopes, though the effect sizes were small and variable. In spite of 
this, the APOE2 cohort showed shorter lifespan relative to APOE3 homozygous 
mice. None of the cohorts accumulated appreciable levels of phosphorylated tau 
compartmentalized in the insoluble cell fraction. RNAseq analysis showed that 
the induction of immune gene expression was comparable across all the APOE 
genotypes in PS19 mice. Notably, the APOE4 homozygous mice showed additional 
induction of transcripts corresponding to the Alzheimer's disease-related 
plaque-induced gene signature. In human Alzheimer's disease brain tissues, we 
found no direct correlation between higher burden of phosphorylated tau and 
APOE4 genotype. As expected, there was a strong correlation between 
phosphorylated tau burden with amyloid deposition in APOE4-positive Alzheimer's 
disease cases. Overall, our results indicate that APOE3 genotype may confer some 
resilience to tauopathy, while APOE4 and APOE2 may act through multiple pathways 
to increase the pathogenicity in the context of tauopathy.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40478-023-01581-2

(#)Contributed equally","Chick embryos are a valuable model for studying immunity and vaccines. 
Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the molecular mechanism of the 
Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG)-induced immune response in chick embryos for the 
prevention and control of MG. In this study, we screened for downregulated 
let-7d microRNA in MG-infected chicken embryonic lungs to explore its 
involvement in the innate immune mechanism against MG. Here, we demonstrated 
that low levels of let-7d are a protective mechanism for chicken embryo primary 
type II pneumocytes (CP-II) in the presence of MG. Specifically, we found that 
depressed levels of let-7 in CP-II cells reduced the adhesion capacity of MG. 
This suppressive effect was achieved through the activated mitogen-activated 
protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1) target gene and the inactivated 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, MG-induced 
hyperinflammation and cell death were both alleviated by downregulation of 
let-7d. In conclusion, chick embryos protect themselves against MG infection 
through the innate immune molecule let-7d, which may result from its function as 
an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway to effectively mitigate MG adhesion, the 
inflammatory response and cell apoptosis. This study may provide new insight 
into the development of vaccines against MG.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13567-023-01178-6

of intraoperative urinary catheterization after anaesthesia. We conducted this 
study to compare the effect of tramadol and lornoxicam for the prevention of 
postoperative CRBD.
METHODS: One-hundred twenty patients (aged 18-60 years, ASA physical status 1-2, 
undergoing elective uterine surgery requiring intraoperative urinary 
catheterization were randomly divided into three groups with 40 patients in each 
group. Group T received 1.5 mg/kg tramadol, group L received 8-mg lornoxicam, 
and group C received normal saline. The study drugs were administered 
intravenously at the end of the surgery. The incidence and severity of CRBD were 
reported at 0, 1, 2, and 6 h after arrival at the postanaesthesia care unit 
(PACU).
RESULTS: The incidence of CRBD was significantly lower in groups T and L than in 
group C at 1, 2, and 6 h after surgery. The incidence of moderate to severe CRBD 
was also significantly lower in groups T and L than in group C at 0, 1, and 2 h 
after surgery. The severity of CRBD reported as mild, moderate, and severe was 
reduced in groups T and L compared with group C at most times after surgery. 
Group T had a higher incidence of nausea than group C, and there were no 
differences in dizziness, drowsiness, or vomit among the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Tramadol and lornoxicam administered intravenously at the end of 
the surgery were both effective in preventing the incidence and severity of CRBD 
after uterine surgery. However, tramadol increased the incidence of nausea 
compared with saline, but there was no difference between tramadol and

less than 5% of all glenohumeral dislocations. Bilateral locked posterior 
shoulder fracture-dislocation is an extremely rare entity with an incidence of 
0.6 cases/100 000 people/year. A few reports have been published in the 
literature, predominantly associated with epileptic seizures. CASE REPORT We 
present a rare case of a 55-year-old male patient with a history of epileptic 
seizures, who presented with bilateral, locked, posterior fracture-dislocation 
of the shoulder following an epileptic seizure. The patient was diagnosed with a 
cavernous hemangioma, which caused his epileptic episode. He was treated 
operatively, with a modified McLaughlin procedure performed on both sides, at 1 
stage, by 2 surgical teams. The cavernous hemangioma was also resected 2 months 
later. After a follow-up period of 18 months, no recurrent episodes of 
instability or dislocation were identified. Full range of motion was present on 
both sides, with good clinical and radiological outcomes. We also conducted a 
literature review to elucidate the causes of this rare incidence, along with 
diagnostic workup and treatment options. We were able to identify 36 cases, 
involving 72 shoulders of bilateral posterior fracture-dislocations in 30 case 
reports and 2 case series. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral posterior fracture-dislocation 
of the shoulder is uncommon. Treatment strategy depends on the chronicity, 
involvement of the humeral head, and the patient's age and functional level. The 
target is to restore shoulder anatomy and maintain a functional range of motion.","DOI: 10.12659/AJCR.940141

medical comorbidities including substance use disorder. However, it is unknown 
whether there is a difference in COVID-19 treatment outcomes between patients 
who are current cannabis users, excessive alcohol drinkers and those who use a 
known hazardous stimulant such as methamphetamine (METH).
METHODS: Electronic medical records (EMR) of COVID-19 patients with current METH 
(n = 32), cannabis (n = 46), and heavy alcohol use (n = 44) were reviewed. 
COVID-19 infection was confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, current drug 
use was confirmed by positive urine drug testing, and alcohol use was identified 
by a blood alcohol concentration greater than 11 mg/dl. Multivariate linear 
regression models as well as the firth logistic regression models were used to 
examine the effect of substance use group (METH, cannabis, or alcohol) on 
treatment outcome measures.
RESULTS: A total of 122 patients were included in this analysis. There were no 
significant differences found between drug groups in regards to key SARS-CoV-2 
outcomes of interest including ICU admission, length of stay, interval between 
SARS-CoV-2 positive test and hospital discharge, delirium, intubation and 
mortality after adjusting for covariates. About one-fifth (21.9% in METH users, 
15.2% in cannabis users, and 20.5% in alcohol users) of all patients required 
ICU admission. As many as 37.5% of METH users, 23.9% of cannabis users, and 
29.5% of alcohol users developed delirium (P = 0.4). There were no significant 
differences between drug groups in COVID-19 specific medication requirements. 
Eight patients in total died within 10 months of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. 
Two patients from the METH group (6.3%), two patients from the cannabis group 
(4.3%), and four patients from the alcohol group (9.1%) died.
DISCUSSION: The study outcomes may have been affected by several limitations. 
These included the methodology of its retrospective design, relatively small 
sample size, and the absence of a COVID-19 negative control group. In addition, 
there was no quantification of substance use and many covariates relied on

CONCLUSION: Despite these limitations, our results show that current METH, 
cannabis, and heavy alcohol users in this study have similar treatment outcomes 
and suffer from high morbidity including in-hospital delirium and high mortality 
rates within the first-year post COVID-19. The extent to which co-morbid tobacco 
smoking contributed to the negative outcomes in METH, cannabis, and alcohol 
users remains to be investigated.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s42238-023-00193-w

Improvement (QI) initiatives, most available research continues to investigate 
sustainability at the end of implementation. As a result, the learning and 
continuous adjustments that shape sustainability outcomes are lost. With little 
understanding of the actions and processes that influence sustainability within 
QI initiatives, there is limited practical guidance and direction on how to 
enhance the sustainability of QI initiatives. This study aims to unpack the 
'process of sustaining', by exploring threats to sustainability encountered 
throughout the implementation of QI Initiatives and identifying strategies used 
by QI teams to address these threats over time.
METHODS: A longitudinal multiple case study design was employed to follow 4 QI 
initiatives over a 3-year period. A standardised sustainability tool was used 
quarterly to collect perceptions of sustainability threats and actions 
throughout implementation. Interviews (n=38), observations (32.5 h), documentary 
analysis, and a focus group (n=10) were conducted to enable a greater 
understanding of how the process of sustaining is supported in practice. Data 
were analysed using the Consolidated Framework for Sustainability (CFS) to 
conduct thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Analysis identified five common threats to sustainability: workforce 
stability, improvement timelines, organisational priorities, capacity for 
improvement, and stakeholder support. Each of these threats impacted multiple 
sustainability constructs demonstrating the complexity of the issues 
encountered. In response to threats, 12 strategies to support the process of 
sustaining were identified under three themes: engagement (five strategies that 
promoted the development of relationships), integration (three strategies that 
supported initiatives to become embedded within local systems), and adaptation 
(four strategies that enhanced understanding of, and response to, emergent 
conditions and contextual needs).
CONCLUSIONS: Sustaining improvements from QI initiatives requires continuous 
investment in relationships, resilience to integrate improvements in local 
systems, and flexibility to understand emergent conditions. Findings provide 
practitioners, funders, and researchers with a better understanding of, and 
preparation for, the threats associated with sustaining improvements from QI 
initiatives and offer insight into specific actions that can be taken to 
mitigate these risks. This learning can be used to inform future initiative 
design and support, to optimise the sustainability of healthcare improvements.

intolerance disease (ME/CFS/SEID) is a condition diagnosed primarily based on 
clinical symptoms, including prolonged fatigue and post-exertional malaise; 
however, there is no specific test for the disease. Additionally, diagnosis can 
be challenging since healthcare professionals may lack sufficient knowledge 
about the disease. Prior studies have shown that patients with ME/CFS/SEID have 
low serum acylcarnitine levels, which may serve as a surrogate test for patients 
suspected of having this disease. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to investigate the differences in serum acylcarnitine levels between patients 
with ME/CFS/SEID and healthy controls.
METHODS: This systematic review was conducted using PubMed and Ichushi-Web 
databases. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses statement, we included all studies from the databases' inception 
until February 17, 2023, that evaluated blood tests in both patients with 
ME/CFS/SEID and healthy control groups. The primary endpoint was the difference 
in serum acylcarnitine levels between the two groups.
RESULTS: The electronic search identified 276 studies. Among them, seven met the 
eligibility criteria. The serum acylcarnitine levels were analyzed in 403 
patients with ME/CFS/SEID. The patient group had significantly lower serum 
acylcarnitine levels when compared with the control group, and the statistical 
heterogeneity was high.
CONCLUSION: The patient group had significantly lower serum acylcarnitine levels 
when compared with the control group. In the future, the measurement of serum 
acylcarnitine levels, in addition to clinical symptoms, may prove to be a 
valuable diagnostic tool for this condition.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-023-04226-z

stable for audiovisual combined stimuli than sole auditory or visual stimuli. In 
addition, piano players are superior in synchronous tapping and manipulating the 
ring and little fingers as compared to inexperienced individuals. However, it is 
currently unknown whether the ability to synchronize to external sensory stimuli 
with the ring finger is at the level of the index finger in piano players. The 
aim of this study was to compare the effect of piano experience on 
synchronization stability between the index and ring fingers using auditory, 
visual, and audiovisual combined stimuli.
METHODS: Thirteen piano players and thirteen novices participated in this study. 
They were instructed to tap with their index or ring finger synchronously to 
auditory, visual, and audiovisual combined stimuli. The stimuli were presented 
from an electronic metronome at 1 Hz, and the tapping was performed 30 times in 
each condition. We analyzed standard deviation of intervals between the stimulus 
onset and the tap onset as synchronization stability.
RESULTS: Synchronization stability for visual stimuli was lower during ring than 
index finger tapping in novices; however, this decline was absent in piano 
players. Also, piano players showed the higher synchronization stability for 
audiovisual combined stimuli than sole visual and auditory stimuli when tapping 
with the index finger. On the other hand, in novices, synchronization stability 
was higher for audiovisual combined stimuli than only visual stimuli.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that improvements of both sensorimotor 
processing and finger motor control by piano practice would contribute to 
superior synchronization stability.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40101-023-00327-2

effects on metabolic responses and arterial stiffness in the postprandial 
period. This study aims to assess the postprandial effects of dietary protein 
sources, including animal-based protein (AP) and plant-based protein (PP), as 
part of a high-protein breakfast on appetite response, energy metabolism, and 
arterial stiffness in overweight and obese men.
METHODS: This acute randomized crossover clinical trial will be conducted at the 
Persian study research center at Imam Reza Hospital, affiliated with the Mashhad 
University of Medical Sciences, located in the northeast of Iran. Forty-six 
healthy overweight, and obese men aged 18-60 years will be enrolled based on the 
eligibility criteria. The subjects will complete two interventions (high-protein 
AP and PP meals) with 1 week washout period. The primary outcome will be the 
acute effect of the two test meals on appetite response, energy metabolism 
parameters, including resting metabolism rate (RMR), diet-induced thermogenesis 
(DIT), and substrate oxidation (SO), and arterial stiffness indices, including 
pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse wave analysis (PWA). The secondary outcomes 
include changes in lipemia, glycemia, and insulinemia.
DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will provide novel insight regarding the 
acute effects of different protein sources on energy metabolism, appetite, and 
arterial stiffness as a significant cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. It 
will help dieticians develop effective and efficient meal plans to improve 
weight reduction and maintenance in overweight/obese individuals.

approximately 30%. Poor response to the recommended treatments for neuropathic 
pain, namely antidepressants and/or gabapentinoids, requires the development of 
new techniques to prevent chronic pain. One such well-tolerated technique is the 
administration of autologous plasma enriched in platelets and fibrin (PRF). This 
approach is largely used in regenerative medicine owing to the anti-inflammatory 
and analgesic properties of PRF. It could also be an interesting adjuvant to 
surgery, as it reduces neurogenic inflammation and promotes nerve recovery, 
thereby reducing the incidence of residual postoperative chronic pain. The aim 
of the present study is to evaluate the benefit of periradicular intraoperative 
application of PRF on the residual postsurgical neuropathic pain after disc 
herniation surgery.
METHODS: A randomized, prospective, interventional, controlled, single-blind 
study with evaluation by a blind outcome assessor will be performed in 
Strasbourg University Hospital. We will compare a control group undergoing 
conventional surgery to an experimental group undergoing surgery and 
periradicular administration of PRF (30 patients in each arm). The primary 
outcome is the intensity of postoperative neuropathic radicular pain, measured 
by a visual analog scale (VAS) at 6 months post-surgery. The secondary outcomes 
are the characteristics of neuropathic pain (NPSI), the quality of life (SF-12 
and PGIC), the presence of anxiety/depression symptoms (HAD), and the 
consumption of analgesics. We will also carry out transcriptomic analysis of a 
panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in blood samples, before surgery 
and at 6 months follow-up. These gene expression results will be correlated with 
clinical data, in particular, with the apparition of postoperative neuropathic 
pain.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the 
efficacy of PRF in the prevention of neuropathic pain following surgery for 
herniated disc. This study addresses not only a clinical question but will also 
provide information on the physiopathological mechanisms of neuropathic pain.

acute abdomen. It is important to differentiate it from other abdominal 
conditions that require emergency management. It was first reported in 
literature in 1896 and about 400 cases have been reported till date.
CASE PRESENTATION: We reported on a 41 year-old Para 0+0 Ibo house wife who 
presented with 10 years history of supra-pubic mass and five months history of 
excessive menstrual flow. After physical examination, a diagnosis of symptomatic 
uterine fibroid was made. She had myomectomy and the raw surface created after 
the excision of the myomas was covered with omentum. Wound infection developed 
on the 8th post-operative day leading to a wound breakdown and later partial 
extrusion of infarcted omental tissue through the dehisced wound. During 
re-exploration, the infarcted omental tissue was extracted and the residual 
abdominal abscess was drained. Surgical site wound infection occurred on the 3rd 
day after re-operation and a sub-acute intestinal obstruction developed on the 
4th day thereafter which responded to conservative management.
CONCLUSION: Careful surgical technique is imperative when utilizing the omentum 
for reconstructive abdominal surgery. Torsion of the omentum and creation of 
excess tension while using the omentum for reconstructive procedures should be 
avoided and increase awareness of this uncommon disease condition by the surgeon 
is also important. This case is to report a rare finding of omental infarction 
following myomectomy.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13256-023-03924-y

cruciate ligament rupture before and after lateral fabellar suture stabilisation 
surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen dogs (mean weight, 12.3±5.1 kg) with unilateral 
cranial cruciate ligament rupture were fitted with an accelerometer for seven 
consecutive days at four different time points: before surgery (T0), one (T1), 
three (T3) and six (T6) months after surgery. The total activity and times spent 
in sedentary activity, light to moderate activity and vigorous activity were 
recorded by the accelerometer, and preoperative and postoperative data were 
compared. At all time points, dogs underwent clinical evaluations (lameness 
score, stifle pain score and thigh circumference) and their owners were asked to 
respond to questionnaires to subjectively score the physical activity and 
quality of life of the dogs.
RESULTS: At the four time points, the dogs spent between 21.2 and 21.4 hours on 
sedentary behaviour, 2.3 and 2.5 hours performing light to moderate activity, 
and 13 to 15 minutes performing vigorous activity. There was no increase in 
physical activity variables or decrease in sedentary behaviour over time. 
Lameness scores, pain score and dogs' quality of life improved significantly 
during the postoperative period. At T6, 17 (100%) of 17 dogs presented no 
lameness, 16 (94%) of 17 dogs presented no stifle pain, 16 (94%) of 17 owners 
rated the quality of life as very good and excellent, and 16 (100%) of 16 owners 
reported a total return to normal activity levels.

issue and in recent years several events have occurred worldwide. The aim of 
this systematic review was to characterize injuries and mortality after CPMSs 
focusing on in-hospital management of hemorrhage and vascular injuries.
METHOD: A systematic review of all published literature was undertaken in 
Medline, Embase and Web of Science January 1st, 1968, to February 22nd, 2021, 
according to the PRISMA guidelines. Literature was eligible for inclusion if the 
CPMS included three or more people shot, injured or killed, had vascular 
injuries or hemorrhage.
RESULTS: The search identified 2884 studies; 34 were eligible for inclusion in 
the analysis. There were 2039 wounded in 45 CPMS events. The dominating anatomic 
injury location per event was the extremity followed by abdomen and chest. The 
median number of operations and operated patients per event was 22 (5-101) and 
10.5 (4-138), respectively. A total of 899 deaths were reported with a median 
mortality rate of 36.1% per event (15.9-71.4%) Thirty-eight percent (13/34) of 
all studies reported on vascular injuries. Vascular injuries ranged from 8 to 
29%; extremity vascular injury the most frequent. Specific vascular injuries 
included thoracic aorta 18% (42/232), carotid arteries 6% (14/232), and 
abdominal aorta 5% (12/232). Vascular injuries were involved in 8.3%-10% of all 
deaths.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review showed an overall high mortality after CPMS 
with injuries mainly located to the extremities, thorax and abdomen. About one 
quarter of deaths was related to hemorrhage involving central large vessel 
injuries. Further understanding of these injuries, and structured and uniform 
reporting of injuries and treatment protocols may help improve evaluation and 
management in the future. Level of Evidence Systematic review and meta-analysis,

computerized ball-tossing game. Most Cyberball studies, however, used 
self-report questionnaires, leaving the data vulnerable to reporter bias, and 
associations with individual characteristics have been inconsistent.
METHODS: In this large-scale observational study, we video-recorded 4,813 
10-year-old children during Cyberball and developed a real-time micro-coding 
method measuring facial expressions of anger, sadness and contempt, in a 
multi-ethnic population-based sample. We estimated associations between facial 
expressions and self-reported negative feelings, explored associations of child 
characteristics such as sex and parental national origin with observed and 
self-reported feelings during social exclusion, and tested associations 
of observed and self-reported feelings during social exclusion with behavior 
problems at age 14.
RESULTS: Facial expressions of sadness and anger were associated with 
self-reported negative feelings during the game, but not with such feelings 
after the game. Further, girls reported to have had less negative feelings 
during the game than boys, but no such sex-differences were found in total 
observed emotions. Likewise, children with parents of Moroccan origin reported 
less negative feelings during the game than Dutch children, but their facial 
expressions did not indicate that they were differently affected. Last, observed 
emotions related negatively to later internalizing problems, whereas self-report 
on negative feelings during the game related positively to later internalizing 
and externalizing problems.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that facial expressions are associated with self-reported 
negative feelings during social exclusion, discuss that reporter-bias might be 
minimized using facial expressions, and find divergent associations of observed 
facial expressions and self-reported negative feelings with later internalizing 
problems.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40359-023-01219-x

antimicrobial resistance. Behavior change intervention involving education to 
improve the use of antibiotics is a strategy included in antimicrobial 
stewardship. This study aims to evaluate and compare the impact of two 
educational interventions on knowledge of antibiotic and its use among pediatric 
home caregivers.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the pediatric out-patient 
department of a healthcare facility. A structured questionnaire was administered 
to sixty pediatric caregivers. Pediatric caregivers were grouped in two of 30. 
Caregivers in a group filled the questionnaire, and refilled the same 
questionnaire after a one-on-one education. The second arm refilled the 
questionnaire after a group education. Ethical clearance was obtained and 
participants gave consent. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 22 and 
Graph pad Instat, p values < 0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS: Fouty-nine (81.7%) participants believe that antibiotics can treat 
malaria infection [8(13.3%) after education)], 43(71.7%) of respondents agreed 
that antibiotics can be used to treat all kinds of diarrhea, while 45(65%) of 
them thought that antibiotics in powder form can be reconstituted with hot or 
warm water before use [7(11.7%) after education]. Mean score among the sixty 
participants before and after education on knowledge and use of antibiotics were 
36.1 ± 6.467 versus 46.7 ± 4.027 (p≤0.0001) and 29.82 ± 4.949 versus 
36.92 ± 3.997 (p≤ 0.0001), respectively. Mean score on knowledge and use of 
antibiotics for one-on-one versus group education were 46.7 ± 4.027 versus 
43.3 ± 6.249 (p = 0.022) and 37.9 ± 3.044 versus 35.93 ± 4.608 (p = 0.039), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Many pediatric caregivers had poor knowledge on antibiotics and use 
which improved significantly after education. One-on-one education has more 
impact than group education. Pharmacists and other healthcare professionals can 
use counseling opportunity to inform caregivers on appropriate knowledge and use 
of antibiotics consistently to change behavior.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40545-023-00578-5

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Herbal medicine Sanqi (SQ), the dried root or stem of Panax 
notoginseng (PNS), has been reported to have anti-diabetic and anti-obesity 
effects and is usually administered as a decoction for Chinese medicine. 
Alternative to utilizing PNS pure compound for treatment, we are motivated to 
propose an unconventional scheme to investigate the functions of PNS mixture. 
However, studies providing a detailed overview of the transcriptomics-based 
signaling network in response to PNS are seldom available.
METHODS: To explore the reasoning of PNS in treating metabolic disorders such as 
insulin resistance, we implemented a systems biology-based approach with RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) and miRNA sequencing data to elucidate key pathways, genes 
and miRNAs involved.
RESULTS: Functional enrichment analysis revealed PNS up-regulating oxidative 
stress-related pathways and down-regulating insulin and fatty acid metabolism. 
Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) 
and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLc) mRNA and protein levels, as well as related 
miRNA levels, were measured in PNS treated rat pancreatic β cells (INS-1). PNS 
treatment up-regulated Hmox1, SOD1 and GCLc expression while down-regulating 
miR-24-3p and miR-139-5p to suppress oxidative stress. Furthermore, we verified 
the novel interactions between miR-139-5p and miR-24-3p with GCLc and SOD1.
CONCLUSION: This work has demonstrated the mechanism of how PNS regulates 
cellular molecules in metabolic disorders. Therefore, combining omics data with 
a systems biology strategy could be a practical means to explore the potential 
function and molecular mechanisms of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of 
metabolic disorders.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13020-023-00768-y

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Many patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) suffer from 
psychological distress, fatigue and sleep disturbances, which are associated 
with reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased societal costs. Only limited 
psychosocial treatment options are available. As Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
Therapy (MBCT) has demonstrated to improve psychological distress, QoL and sleep 
in other populations, MBCT might also be effective in patients with IBD.
METHODS: The MindIBD study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled 
trial comparing MBCT plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) versus TAU alone in a 
targeted number of 136 IBD patients in remission, aged 16 years and older with 
at least mild psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) total score ≥ 11). Primary outcome is reduction of psychological distress 
post-intervention, measured by the HADS. In addition, the effect of MBCT on 
sleep quality (including actigraphy and electroencephalography recordings), 
fatigue, disease activity, perceived disease control, QoL and positive mental 
health will be examined. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, 
9 and 12 months follow-up. Cost-effectiveness will be determined and a process 
evaluation will be conducted.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide valuable insight into the clinical effect of 
MBCT on psychological distress, sleep quality, fatigue and QoL in IBD patients 
and into the cost-effectiveness. If effective, MBCT can be a valuable addition 
to the available psychosocial interventions for patients with IBD. Moreover, 
findings from this study may also be applicable in patients with other chronic 
conditions.

eyyangyunfa@scut.edu.cn.","OBJECTIVE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication along with poor 
prognosis in geriatric intertrochanteric fracture (ITF) patients. However, the 
prevention and treatment of POD remain unclear. Previous studies have confirmed 
that POD is essentially a consequence of neuro-inflammatory responses. 
Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid with comprehensive anti-inflammatory effects, 
while a high dose of dexamethasone correlates with many side effects or even 
adverse consequences. Thus, this prospective study aims to discuss whether a 
single preoperative low-dose dexamethasone can reduce the impact of POD on 
geriatric ITF patients with internal fixation surgery.
METHODS: Between June 2020 and October 2022, there were 219 consecutive ITF 
patients assessed in our department. Of the 219 ITF patients, 160 cases who met 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria were finally enrolled and randomly 
allocated to the dexamethasone group and the placebo group (80 geriatric ITF 
patients in each group) in this prospective study. The patients in the 
dexamethasone group received intravenous 10 mg (2 ml) dexamethasone while the 
patients in the placebo group received intravenous 2 ml saline in 30 min before 
being sent to the operating room, respectively. The baseline characteristics, 
surgical information, incidence and severity of POD as the efficacy-related 
outcomes, and infection events and hyperglycemia as safety-related outcomes 
(adverse events), were collected and analyzed between the two groups. The 
severity of POD was evaluated by Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) 
score.
RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline characteristics and surgical 
information between the dexamethasone group and the placebo group. The 
dexamethasone group had a lower incidence of POD than the placebo group within 
the first 5 days after surgery [(9/80, 11.3% vs. 21/80, 26.3%, RR = 0.83, 95% CI 
0.71-0.97, P = 0.015]. The dexamethasone group had lower MDAS scores (Mean ± SD) 
than the placebo group [13.2 ± 1.0 (range 11 to 15) vs. 15.48 ± 2.9 (range 9 to 
20), P = 0.011, effect size = 0.514]. There were no differences in infection 
events and hyperglycemia between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A single preoperative low-dose dexamethasone may reduce the 
incidence and severity of POD in geriatric ITF patients with internal fixation 
surgery.

RESULTS: Of 120 positive samples, 170 isolates were identified. Polymicrobial 
infections were determined in 55% of samples. The dominant Gram-positive 
isolated strains were Staphylococcus aureus, especially from wound infections 
because of accidents (71.8%). Piperacillin, methicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, 
and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were all highly resistant to S. aureus and 
Coagulase-negative Staphylococci. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. 
aureus in wound infections was 89.9%. S. aureus showed superior sensitivity to

(PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF) is one of the most commonly used self-assessment 
questionnaires for evaluating function in children with congenital upper 
extremity anomalies. However, this English questionnaire is difficult for Thai 
parents to complete. The purpose of this study is to translate the PROMIS Parent 
Proxy UE-SF into Thai and test its reliability and validity.
METHODS: The PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF was translated into Thai using FACIT 
translation methodology. This version and the Thai version of the Michigan Hand 
Questionnaire (Thai-MHQ) were used to evaluate 30 Thai children with different 
types of congenital upper extremity anomalies. The reliability and validity of 
the Thai-PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF were evaluated by test-and-retest with the 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. 
Correlations between the Thai-PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF and Thai-MHQ were 
analysed by Pearson's correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: The children's mean age was 4.47 ± 2.08 years (range 1-9 years). The 
main diagnoses included thumb duplication (11 children), syndactyly (4 
children)4, congenital trigger thumb (3 children) and obstetric brachial plexus 
palsy (3 children). The children's parents completed the questionnaires, taking 
164.23 ± 22.58 s for the Thai-PROMIS and 337.8 ± 49.37 s for the Thai-MHQ. The 
test-retest reliability of Thai-PROMIS evaluated by ICCs, was 0.9909 (good 
reliability), and the Cronbach's alpha of all items was 0.923. The Pearson's 
correlation coefficient between the Thai-PROMIS and Thai-MHQ showed a strong 
correlation with Domain 2 (activities of daily living, r = 0.7432) and a 
moderate correlation with the overall Thai-MHQ score (r = 0.699).

causes of pancreatitis include hypertriglyceridemia, trauma, congenital 
anomalies, and medications. Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis is distinguished, 
as it is more severe and complicated. The management of hypertriglyceridemic 
pancreatitis, other than the basic care given to other pancreatitis patients, is 
to decrease the serum triglyceride level to less than 500 mg/dl as soon as 
possible. Plasmapheresis, hemofiltration, and other modalities have been proven 
effective therapies, but, are expensive and not easily accessible. Insulin and 
heparin which are cheaper alternatives for treatment, have been reported in case 
reports along with one randomized controlled trial. The number of patients in 
these reports was small, so, the therapy is not well established. For most 
African countries like ours, the only option for management is heparin and 
insulin. Despite this fact, there has not been any publication regarding this 
issue on our continent.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 24 years old Ethiopian male who presented 
with severe central abdominal pain, easy fatiguability, and vomiting of one-day 
duration. He was tachycardic and tachypneic with diffuse abdominal tenderness, 
and had tendon xanthomas. His plasma was lactescent with a serum triglyceride 
level of 4775 mg/dl. His abdominal CT scan showed diffuse pancreatic swelling 
with a peripancreatic fluid collection, and his serum lipase was elevated. With 
a diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis, he was managed with 
intravenous insulin infusion along with subcutaneous heparin. His random blood 
sugar was checked hourly with three episodes of hypoglycemia during therapy. His 
serum triglyceride level dropped to less than 500 mg/dl in three days, and he 
was discharged with no complications.
CONCLUSION: Since our findings are consistent with a prior randomized controlled 
trial and compilation of case reports, it would strengthen the evidence for 
safety and efficacy of insulin and heparin therapy. This therapy, which is the 
only available therapy in most countries of our continent, would decrease most 
of the complications of hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis that we face. We 
believe, our report would be a wake-up call for researchers and clinicians in 
our continent to change their practice and strengthen the evidence for the 
treatment.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13256-023-03995-x

individuals there have no health insurance and depend on a parallel healthcare 
structure. Voluntary associations, such as MediNetz and healthcare vouchers 
(""Anonymer Krankenschein"" - AKS), support uninsured citizens. This study aimed 
to provide insights into associations, such as MediNetz and AKS that provide 
healthcare for individuals without health insurance in North Rhine-Westphalia, 
the largest federal state in Germany.
METHODS: A mixed methods approach was chosen. A qualitative study using 
interviews with experts was performed to gain their knowledge and explore the 
various challenges that AKS and MediNetz associations faced and the possible 
improvements that could be made. A quantitative survey was conducted to analyse 
the demographic data of the patients who required AKS or MediNetz's assistance 
and the characteristics of each association through a separate questionnaire. 
Data was received from the association in Aachen, Bielefeld, Bonn, Düsseldorf, 
and Essen.
RESULTS: More women than men sought medical care; most were between 25 and 49 
years old. The proportion of individuals without residency status accounted for 
the largest share (53.6%). Common reasons for patients to make contact were 
acute illnesses (40.2%) and pregnancies (22.3%). Most patients were sent to 
gynaecologists and general practitioners. Asking the experts, it became apparent 
that the existing system could not reach the standard of the regular healthcare 
in Germany. Financial and human resources were insufficient. Therefore, 
prevention was limited, especially chronically ill patients or patients with a 
severe illness requiring hospitalisation could not be treated. AKS had 
advantages compared to MediNetz, as the care came closer to the expected German 
medical standards.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a demand for associations providing healthcare 
for individuals without health insurance. However, the healthcare provided by 
MediNetz and AKS did not reach the standard of healthcare in Germany and mainly 
depended on the organisations' resources. Funded projects such as an AKS 
combined with clearing centres significantly improved healthcare. Until 
structural measures are implemented, they can be a transitional solution by 
spreading nationwide.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12939-023-01930-6

prognostication and guidance of therapeutic decisions in human cancers. The 
objective of this study was to enumerate CTC over time in dogs with naturally 
occurring osteosarcoma (OSA), and to determine correlation with patient outcome. 
Twenty-six dogs with OSA and no evidence of metastatic disease at the time of 
amputation were enrolled. Dogs were assessed for lung metastases and CTC prior 
to and following amputation, and at each chemotherapy visit. Twenty-one dogs 
completed the study. Nineteen dogs were euthanized and two were alive and free 
of metastases. Overall survival time ranged from 88 to 1058 days (median 
survival time (MST) 374 days). Increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity, 
advanced age, and higher body weight were significantly associated with lower 
MST. Dogs with OSA had a mean of 356 (0 to 4443) CTC/106 leukocytes. In 12 of 15 
dogs that developed radiographic evidence of metastasis, a pre-metastatic CTC 
spike was retrospectively detectable on average 36.5 (1-100 days) days prior to 
metastasis and was associated with significantly shorter MST (301 ± 64 vs. 
626 ± 55 days; p = .0107). In a multivariable analysis, dogs with a CTC spike 
were 10× more likely to die compared with those without. These results suggest 
that a spike in CTC frequency precedes detection of metastasis in dogs with OSA 
and is associated with shorter survival. More frequent enumeration of CTC in a 
larger cohort of dogs with OSA may be warranted.","© 2023 The Authors. Veterinary and Comparative Oncology published by John Wiley

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Explaining the emergence of the hallmarks of bilaterians is a 
central focus of evolutionary developmental biology-evodevo-and evolutionary 
genomics. For this purpose, we must both expand and also refine our knowledge of 
non-bilaterian genomes, especially by studying early branching animals, in 
particular those in the metazoan phylum Porifera.
RESULTS: We present a comprehensive analysis of the first whole genome of a 
glass sponge, Oopsacas minuta, a member of the Hexactinellida. Studying this 
class of sponge is evolutionary relevant because it differs from the three other 
Porifera classes in terms of development, tissue organization, ecology, and 
physiology. Although O. minuta does not exhibit drastic body simplifications, 
its genome is among the smallest of animal genomes sequenced so far, 
and surprisingly lacks several metazoan core genes (including Wnt and several 
key transcription factors). Our study also provides the complete genome of a 
symbiotic Archaea dominating the associated microbial community: a new 
Thaumarchaeota species.
CONCLUSIONS: The genome of the glass sponge O. minuta differs from all other 
available sponge genomes by its compactness and smaller number of encoded 
proteins. The unexpected loss of numerous genes previously considered ancestral 
and pivotal for metazoan morphogenetic processes most likely reflects the 
peculiar syncytial tissue organization in this group. Our work further documents 
the importance of convergence during animal evolution, with multiple convergent 
evolution of septate-like junctions, electrical-signaling and multiciliated 
cells in metazoans.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12915-023-01619-w

due to the potentially harmful effects it can have not only on pregnant women 
but also on the fetus.
OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the magnitude of self-medication practice and 
associated factors among pregnant women following antenatal care (ANC) in 
primary healthcare settings in the North Wollo Zone of Ethiopia.
METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 395 
pregnant mothers who attended ANC follow-up in selected health centers in the 
North Wollo Zone of Ethiopia from April 20 to May 20, 2021. A multi-stage 
sampling method was employed to enroll participants. A face-to-face structured 
interview was conducted to collect the data. A logistic regression analysis was 
used to determine the factors associated with self-medication practice. A p 
value < 0.05 at the 95% confidence level was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 444 participants approached, 395 (89%) participated 
in the study. Of these, 44.6% reported practicing self-medication during the 
current pregnancy. Age < 35 (AOR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.02-9.15; p = 0.032), rural 
residence (AOR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.43-10.19; p = 0.017), and previous medication 
use (AOR = 5.02, 95% CI 1.24-12.93; p = 0.015) were found to have a significant 
association with self-medication practice.
CONCLUSION: Self-medication was highly prevalent among pregnant women in the 
study setting and result indicates need for critical action. Younger rural women 
with a history of self-medication use should be provided counselling to find a 
prescription medication, and measures are needed to minimize self-medication 
related harm in pregnant women.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s40545-023-00584-7

increase the number of smokers that attempt to quit smoking and enrol into 
cessation counselling. The approach has not yet been implemented in general 
practice in the Netherlands. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
influence of a comprehensive implementation strategy on the delivery of 
Ask-Advise-Connect for smoking cessation within Dutch general practice during 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A pre-post study was conducted between late 2020 and early 2022, and 
included 106 Dutch primary care providers (GPs, practice nurses and doctor's 
assistants). Participation lasted nine months: during the first three months 
participants delivered smoking cessation care as usual (pre-intervention); the 
implementation strategy came into effect after three months and participants 
were followed up for another six months (post-intervention). The implementation 
strategy consisted of two meetings in which participants were educated about 
Ask-Advise-Connect, made agreements on the implementation of Ask-Advise-Connect 
and reflected on these agreements. Participants also received online educational 
materials and a desk card as reminder. The changes in the proportions of 'Ask' 
and 'Advise' over time were modelled using linear mixed effects models. A 
descriptive analysis was conducted with regard to referrals to cessation 
counselling.
RESULTS: Participants provided consultations to 29,112 patients (both smokers 
and non-smokers). Results of the linear mixed effects model show that the 
proportion of patients that were asked about smoking ('Ask') significantly 
decreased in the first three months (pre-intervention), but slightly increased 
again after the implementation strategy came into effect (post-intervention). No 
significant change over time was found with regard to the proportion of patients 
advised to quit smoking ('Advise'). Descriptive statistics suggested that more 
participants proactively (vs. passively) referred patients to cessation 
counselling post-intervention ('Connect').
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that a comprehensive implementation strategy 
can support primary care providers in offering smoking cessation care to 
patients, even under stressful COVID-19 conditions. Additional implementation 
efforts are needed to increase the proportion of patients that receive a quit 
advice and proactive referral.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12913-023-09692-1

complex care coordination and cause considerable logistic burden for families. 
We used renal tumors as a model to examine healthcare utilization and cost 
following new solid tumor diagnosis.
METHODS: Children (ages 0-21) with International Classification of Disease (ICD) 
codes for renal malignancy and subsequent nephrectomy were identified from North 
Carolina Medicaid claims data (2014-2020). We stratified patients by duration of 
follow-up, then quantified healthcare utilization and billing totals.
RESULTS: Eighty-one children met study criteria. Median age at diagnosis was 
3 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 1-5). Median family monthly earned income 
was $0. One month following diagnosis, children cumulatively spent a median of 
16 days receiving medical care (IQR: 10-20), 28 days at 3 months (IQR: 21-43), 
and 50.5 days at 1 year (IQR: 35-94.5). Children cumulatively spent a median 
12 days as inpatients during the first 3 months (IQR: 7-17) and 13.5 days at 
1 year (IQR: 8.5-37). Children cumulatively completed a median 12 outpatient 
encounters at 3 months (IQR: 7-17) and 26 at 1 year (IQR: 12-36). At 1 year, 
median Medicaid claim reimbursements for children with renal malignancy was 
$50,041 (IQR: $36,670-$80,734).
CONCLUSION: In examining healthcare utilization in children with renal tumor 
diagnoses, the substantial number of days spent in medical facilities greatly 
impacts the burden of care on families, especially for those with limited 
financial resources. Awareness of this logistic strain on families and careful 
planning to consolidate patient visits may improve the navigability of pediatric

toxicities in moderately hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT) for locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (LA-PDAC) by 
changing the planning organs at risk volume (PRV) margin and the target matching 
method and assessed the causes of adverse events.
METHODS: We examined 37 patients with LA-PDAC who underwent moderately 
hypofractionated IMRT between 2016 and 2020 at our institution; 23 patients were 
treated with wide PRV margins and soft tissue matching (Protocol A) and 14 with 
narrow PRV margins and fiducial marker matching (Protocol B). The GI toxicities, 
local control (LC) rate, and overall survival (OS) were assessed for each 
protocol. The initially planned and daily doses to the gross tumor volume (GTV), 
stomach, and duodenum, reproduced from cone-beam computed tomography, were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The late GI toxicity rate of grades 3-4 was higher in Protocol B 
(42.9%) than in Protocol A (4.3%). Although the 2-year LC rates were 
significantly higher in Protocol B (90.0%) than in Protocol A (33.3%), no 
significant difference was observed in OS rates. In the initial plan, no 
deviations were found for the stomach and duodenum from the dose constraints in 
either protocol. In contrast, daily dose evaluation for the stomach to duodenal 
bulb revealed that the frequency of deviation of V3 Gy per session was 44.8% in 
Protocol B, which was significantly higher than the 24.3% in Protocol A.
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing PRV margins with fiducial marker matching increased GI 
toxicities in exchange for improved LC. Daily dose analysis indicated the 
trade-off between the GTV dose coverage and the irradiated doses to the GI. This 
study showed that even with strict matching methods, the PRV margin could not be 
reduced safely because of GI inter-fractional error, which is expected to be

health care systems worldwide. Evidence suggests that university students may 
have unique risk factors for developing MSKDs; however, research on the 
corresponding prevalence and risk factors of MSKDs in Canadian students is 
limited.
METHODS: Using a multi-year cross-sectional survey, we aimed to understand the 
prevalence and risk factors of MSKDs in students at McMaster University. A 
survey on the prevalence of MSKD as well as potential risk factors was conducted 
online in the years 2018-2022. Our outcomes were the prevalence of MSKDs over 
the last 7 days and the last 12 months, as well as presence of lower body, upper 
body, and spine MSKDs. We investigated risk factors using negative binomial 
regression analysis, including a sex-stratified analysis.
RESULTS: There were a total of 289 respondents in 2018 with a decrease in the 
number of participants in the subsequent years (n2019 = 173, n2020 = 131, 
n2021 = 76). Participants reported a median of 2-3 pain sites in the last year 
and 1-2 pain sites in the last week in all four years. The most prevalent 
sources of self-reported pain were the lower back and neck. Depending on the 
year and outcome studied, 59-67% of participants reported neck/lower back pain 
in the last year, and 43-49% reported it in the last week. Although risk factors 
were different depending on the year and sex, overall, poorer mental health, 
being in health care studies, regular sports participation (males only), older 
age, and less hours of sleep were significantly associated with higher 
prevalence of MSKDs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that MSKDs are a prevalent source of pain in 
university students. While some risk factors, such as mental health, are known 
to play a role in developing MSKDs, sports activity and academic pressure are 
risk factors that are unique to students. Our study also suggests that there may 
be differences in risk factors between sexes.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12891-023-06630-4

in the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms, such as carbapenemase producing 
Enterobacterales (CPE). Several sequential outbreaks of CPE on the geriatric 
ward of the Ghent University hospital have led to an outbreak investigation. 
Focusing on OXA-48 producing Citrobacter freundii, the most prevalent species, 
we aimed to track clonal relatedness using whole genome sequencing (WGS). By 
exploring transmission routes we wanted to improve understanding and 
(re)introduce targeted preventive measures.
METHODS: Environmental screening (toilet water, sink and shower drains) was 
performed between 2017 and 2021. A retrospective selection was made of 53 
Citrobacter freundii screening isolates (30 patients and 23 environmental 
samples). DNA from frozen bacterial isolates was extracted and prepped for 
shotgun WGS. Core genome multilocus sequence typing was performed with an 
in-house developed scheme using 3,004 loci.
RESULTS: The CPE positivity rate of environmental screening samples was 19.0% 
(73/385). Highest percentages were found in the shower drain samples (38.2%) and 
the toilet water samples (25.0%). Sink drain samples showed least CPE positivity 
(3.3%). The WGS data revealed long-term co-existence of three patient sample 
derived C. freundii clusters. The biggest cluster (ST22) connects 12 patients 
and 8 environmental isolates taken between 2018 and 2021 spread across the ward. 
In an overlapping period, another cluster (ST170) links eight patients and four 
toilet water isolates connected to the same room. The third C. freundii cluster 
(ST421) connects two patients hospitalised in the same room but over a period of 
one and a half year. Additional sampling in 2022 revealed clonal isolates linked 
to the two largest clusters (ST22, ST170) in the wastewater collection pipes 
connecting the rooms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest long-term circulation and transmission of 
carbapenemase producing C. freundii clones in hospital sanitary installations 
despite surveillance, daily cleaning and intermittent disinfection protocols. We 
propose a role for the wastewater drainage system in the spread within and 
between rooms and for the sanitary installations in the indirect transmission 
via bioaerosol plumes. To tackle this problem, a multidisciplinary approach is 
necessary including careful design and maintenance of the plumbing system.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13756-023-01261-9

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Bone marrow metastasis (BMM) is underestimated in gastric cancer 
(GC). GC with BMM frequently complicate critical hematological abnormalities 
like diffused intravascular coagulation and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, 
which constitute a highly aggressive GC (HAGC) subtype. HAGC present a very poor 
prognosis with peculiar clinical and pathological features when compared with 
not otherwise specified advanced GC (NAGC). But the molecular mechanisms 
underlying BMM from GC remain rudimentary.
METHODS: The transcriptomic difference between HAGC and NAGC were analyzed. 
Genes that were specifically upregulated in HAGC were identified, and their 
effect on cell migration and invasion was studied. The function of ACTN2 gene 
were confirmed by GC cell lines, bone-metastatic animal model and patients' 
tissues. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of ACTN2 derived-BMM was explored 
by multiple immunofluorescence staining, western blot, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays.
RESULTS: We elucidated the key mechanisms of BMM depending on the transcriptomic 
difference between HAGC and NAGC. Five genes specifically upregulated in HAGC 
were assessed their effect on cell migration and invasion. The ACTN2 gene 
encoding protein α-Actinin-2 was detected enhanced the metastatic capability and 
induced BMM of GC cells in mouse models. Mechanically, α-Actinin-2 was involved 
in filopodia formation where it promoted the Actin filament cross-linking by 
replacing α-Actinin-1 to form α-Actinin-2:α-Actinin-4 complexes in GC cells. 
Moreover, NF-κB subunit RelA and α-Actinin-2 formed heterotrimers in the nuclei 
of GC cells. As a direct target of RelA:α-Actinin-2 heterotrimers, the ACTN2 
gene was a positive auto-regulatory loop for α-Actinin-2 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a link between filopodia, BMM and ACTN2 activation, 
where a feedforward activation loop between ACTN2 and RelA is established via 
actin in response to distant metastasis. Given the novel filopodia formation 
function and the new mechanism of BMM in GC, we propose ACTN2 as a druggable 
molecular vulnerability that may provide potential therapeutic benefit against 
BMM of GC.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12967-023-04156-w

clinical performance and treatment parameters of extracorporeal hemoadsorption 
integrated with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) in 
critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
and respiratory failure under US FDA Emergency Use Authorization.
DESIGN: Multicenter, observational, registry (NCT04391920).
SETTING: Intensive care units (ICUs) in five major US academic centers between 
April 2020 and January 2022.
PATIENTS: A total of 100 critically ill adults with COVID-19-related ARDS 
requiring VV ECMO support, who were treated with extracorporeal hemoadsorption.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, 
laboratory values and outcomes were recorded following individual ethics 
committee approval at each center. Detailed data on organ support utilization 
parameters and hemoadsorption treatments were also collected. Biomarker data 
were collected according to the standard practice at each participating site, 
and available values were compared before and after hemoadsorption. The primary 
outcome of mortality was evaluated using a time-to-event analysis. A total of 
100 patients (63% male; age 44 ± 11 years) were included. Survival rates were 
86% at 30 days and 74% at 90 days. Median time from ICU admission to the 
initiation of hemoadsorption was 87 h and was used to define two post hoc 
groups: ≤ 87 h (group-early start, GE) and > 87 h (group-late start, GL). After 
the start of hemoadsorption, patients in the GE versus GL had significantly 
shorter median duration of mechanical ventilation (7 [2-26] vs. 17 [7-37] days, 
p = 0.02), ECMO support (13 [8-24] vs. 29 [14-38] days, p = 0.021) and ICU stay 
(17 [10-40] vs 36 [19-55] days, p = 0.002). Survival at 90 days in GE was 82% 
compared to 66% in GL (p = 0.14). No device-related adverse events were 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with severe COVID-19-related ARDS 
treated with the combination of VV-ECMO and hemoadsorption, 90-day survival was 
74% and earlier intervention was associated with shorter need for organ support 
and ICU stay. These results lend support to the concept of ""enhanced lung rest""

training program was six sessions and included lessons about why research is 
important, how to conduct research, and an experiential learning project where 
co-researchers conducted a study of their coaches. The program was well received 
by participants, and one year later they were still involved with research

Helicobacter pylori, which grows increasingly resistant to antibiotics. 
Polymerase chain reaction-based methods for antibiotic susceptibility testing 
are available for detecting H. pylori-specific mutations that confer resistance 
to clarithromycin and levofloxacin. Several meta-analyses have compared 
eradication rates for susceptibility-guided versus empirical therapy for H. 
pylori treatment; however, all have significant limitations and high 
heterogeneity, and the results are contradictory. The main objective of this 
trial is to assess whether a sequential strategy based on molecular 
susceptibility testing-guided therapy for H. pylori has a better eradication 
rate than empirical therapy.
METHODS: This trial is designed as a prospective, randomised, open-label, 
active-controlled and single-centre study. Men and women who are H. 
pylori-positive, naïve to treatment, and aged 18-65 years will be recruited. A 
total of 500 participants will be randomised to receive either empirical therapy 
or a susceptibility-guided sequential strategy. Bismuth quadruple therapy will 
be the empirical first-line therapy, and in case of failure, high-dose dual 
(proton-pump inhibitor + amoxicillin) treatment will be the rescue therapy. For 
the susceptibility-guided sequential strategy, regimen selection will be based 
on H. pylori susceptibility to clarithromycin (first-line) and levofloxacin 
(rescue). A first-line treatment of clarithromycin triple therapy will be 
selected for clarithromycin-sensitive strains. For clarithromycin resistance, a 
high-dose dual therapy will be selected. During the rescue treatment, a 
levofloxacin quadruple regimen will be selected for levofloxacin-sensitive 
strains, and a furazolidone quadruple regimen will be selected for others. The 
primary outcome is the first-line eradication rate in both groups, and the 
overall (including first and rescue therapies) H. pylori eradication rate in 
both groups is one of the secondary outcomes. The eradication rates of H. pylori 
will be analysed by intention-to-treat analysis, modified intention-to-treat 
analysis, and per-protocol analysis.
DISCUSSION: This randomised controlled trial will provide objective and valid 
evidence about the value of polymerase chain reaction-based molecular methods 
for antibiotic susceptibility testing in guiding H. pylori eradication.

dental structure; however, there are scanty ones on the orientation and 
identification of their cusps. Therefore, the present article aimed to spot a 
light on arrangement pattern of dental cusps in the camel as a folivorous and 
graminivorous animal. This study was conducted on eight heads of adult, healthy 
camel of both sexes, collected from slaughter houses. To perform exact 
orientation of cusps of molar teeth, additional radiological and CT scans were 
performed on the mandible as a landmark that should facilitate the reading of 
cusps map. It was evident that, the cusps are arranged in crescentic appearance, 
seledontal form, with two cusps on each side, paracone and hypocone on the 
lingual surface and protocone and metacone on the vestibular aspect. Thus, 
camels cannot wear bite like equines, which would interfere with their constant 
chewing method. The camels' dental cusps provide some of the finest examples of 
convergent evolution, which offer insights both into correlates between form and 
function, and into how the ability of euthomorphic cusps in intrapability and 
stabilization of food items and its comminution between formidable cusps and 
occlusal spillway in between. Further studies should be done on the 
brachydontteeth and tropospheric cusps to fill the functional anatomy gap of 
teeth, in addition to diversity of cusps form. This study is considered a basic 
comparative anatomical study for normal healthy dentition and forensic practice,

gynaecologists have been identified across the world. Given well documented 
staff shortages within obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland, it is increasingly 
important to understand the factors which influence medical students to choose 
or reject a career in the speciality. The aim of this study was to ascertain the 
perceptions of final year graduate entry medical students of obstetrics and 
gynaecology, including the factors which may influence a student's decision to 
pursue in a career in the speciality.
METHODS: Paper-based surveys of graduate entry medical students (n = 146) were 
conducted at the beginning and end of a six week rotation in obstetrics and 
gynaecology in Ireland. Responses to the surveys pre- and post-rotation were 
matched and changes in career choices, merits and demerits over time were 
analysed. All analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows version 25.
RESULTS: The responses of 72 students to both questionnaires could be matched 
(response rate of 49.3%). No male students expressed an interest in obstetrics, 
gynaecology or both as a first choice of career in the pre rotation survey. 
Obstetrics as a first choice of career increased from 6.9% pre rotation to 19.4% 
post rotation (p = 0.04) and this increase was seen in male and female students. 
Gynaecology as a first choice increased slightly from 1.4 to 4.2% (p = 0.50) and 
the dual speciality increased from 6.9 to 13.9% (p = 0.23). Students identified 
many merits of obstetrics pre-rotation with more than 60% identifying it as 
exciting, interesting fulfilling and challenging. However, incompatibility with 
family life was cited as a demerit by 72% of respondents and 68.1% identified 
fear of litigation as a demerit. Participants were less positive overall about 
the merits of a career in gynaecology with less than 40% viewing it as exciting, 
fulfilling, and varied.
CONCLUSIONS: While respondents were positive about the merits of a career in 
obstetrics and gynecology, concerns remain about work-life balance, career 
opportunities, and the high-risk nature of the specialty. These concerns should 
be addressed by the profession and policy makers if they wish to attract 
sufficient numbers to address anticipated need in the coming years. Gender 
differences in speciality choice were also evident. If males are to be recruited 
into obstetrics and gynaecology, consideration should be given to the positive 
impact of internship.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12909-023-04425-8

than half of patients have lost > 10% of their body weight at 12 months. In most 
cases, the gastric remnant is used for reconstruction after esophagectomy. One 
of the most serious nutritional complications of this technique is delayed 
gastric emptying caused by gastric remnant mobilization and denervation of the 
vagus nerve. The aim of the PYloroplasty versus No Intervention in GAstric 
REmnant REconstruction after Oesophagectomy (PYNI-GAREREO) trial is to analyze 
the clinical outcome of modified Horsley pyloroplasty (mH-P) as a method of 
preventing delayed gastric emptying.
METHODS: The PYNI-GAREREO trial is designed as an open randomized, single-center 
superiority trial. Patients will be randomly allocated to undergo gastric 
remnant reconstruction with mH-P (intervention group) or no intervention 
(control group) in parallel groups. All patients with esophageal cancer or 
esophagogastric cancer planning to undergo curative minimally invasive 
esophagectomy will be considered for inclusion. A total of 140 patients will be 
included in the study and randomized between the groups in a 1:1 ratio. The 
primary outcome is the body weight change at 6 months postoperatively, and the 
secondary outcomes are the nutritional status, postoperative complications, 
functional outcome, and quality of life until 1 year postoperatively.
DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that mH-P after minimally invasive esophagectomy more 
effectively maintains patients' nutritional status than no pyloroplasty.

endometriosis could be from endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) in 
neonatal uterine blood (NUB). There is no information on the possible 
mechanistic basis linking an association between NUB/neonatal endometrium and 
development of early-onset endometriosis. In this study we performed a series of 
experiments to clarify the mechanistic link between NUB and/or neonatal 
endometrium and development of early-onset endometriosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected postmortem neonatal endometria (n = 15) 
and prospectively collected NUB (n = 18) of female babies for the analysis of 
different biological markers including eMSCs. Immunohistochemical analysis of 
neonatal endometria was performed to examine the expression patterns of ovarian 
steroid receptors (ER/PGR), decidualization (prolactin, IGFBP1), 
pre-decidualization (Glycodelin A, α-SMA), proliferation (Ki-67 index), 
vascularity (CD31 + cells), immunocompetent CD68+, CD45+, CD56 + cells and some 
putative markers of eMSCs. Cell transfer method and immunocytochemistry were 
used to investigate the eMSCs and/or endometrial cells in NUB.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem neonatal endometria revealed 
variable staining response to ER/PGR, decidual markers, and substantial 
proliferative and angiogenic activity. A moderate to strong immunoexpression of 
Glycodelin-A was found in both neonatal and adult endometria. The tissue 
infiltration of CD56+, CD45 + and CD68 + immunocompetent cells was significantly 
low in neonatal endometria than that in adult endometria (p = 0.0003, 
p < 0.0001, p = 0.034, respectively). No eMSCs or even endometrial cells were 
detected in NUB. However, a variable expression of some phenotypes of eMSCs 
(CD90/CD105) was found in neonatal endometria.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our serial experiments we did not find any supporting 
evidence for the role of NUB in early-onset endometriosis. Neonatal endometria 
showed variable expression of ovarian steroid receptors, decidualization, and a 
substantial amount of proliferative and angiogenic activity. As an alternative 
mechanism, a significantly less tissue accumulation of immunocompetent cells in 
neonatal endometria may explain the survival of ER + and PGR + cells should they 
make entry into the pelvis and consequent development of early endometriosis 
with the onset of ovarian function. Future study with large sample size and 
application of modified technological tools is warranted to test the NUB 
hypothesis and to clarify their biological or clinical significance.

translation. It can be used to adapt global recommendations, to identify future 
research priorities and inform local policy decisions. However, there are 
challenges in identifying local evidence in a systematic, comprehensive, and 
timely manner. There is limited guidance on how to map local evidence and 
provide it to users in an accessible and user-friendly way. In this study, we 
address these issues by describing the methods for the development of a 
centralized database of health research evidence for Cameroon and its 
applications for research prioritization and decision making.
METHODS: We searched 10 electronic health databases and hand-searched the 
archives of non-indexed African and Cameroonian journals. We screened titles, 
abstracts, and full texts of peer reviewed journal articles published between 
1999 and 2019 in English or French that assess health related outcomes in 
Cameroonian populations. We extracted relevant study characteristics based on a 
pre-established guide. We developed a coding scheme or taxonomy of content areas 
so that local evidence is mapped to corresponding domains and subdomains. Pairs 
of reviewers coded articles independently and resolved discrepancies by 
consensus. Moreover, we developed guidance on how to search the database, use 
search results to create evidence maps and conduct knowledge gap analyses.
RESULTS: The Cameroon Health Research and Evidence Database (CAMHRED) is a 
bilingual centralized online portal of local evidence on health in Cameroon from 
1999 onwards. It currently includes 4384 studies categorized into content 
domains and study characteristics (design, setting, year and language of 
publication). The database is searchable by keywords or through a guided search. 
Results including abstracts, relevant study characteristics and bibliographic 
information are available for users to download. Upon request, guidance on how 
to optimize search results for applications like evidence maps and knowledge gap 
analyses is also available.
CONCLUSIONS: CAMHRED ( https://camhred.org/ ) is a systematic, comprehensive, 
and centralized resource for local evidence about health in Cameroon. It is 
freely available to stakeholders and provides an additional resource to support 
their work at various levels in the research process.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12961-023-01007-4

injury patterns and their treatment in patients undergoing early (≤ 12 weeks) 
and delayed (> 12 weeks) primary multiligament posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) 
reconstruction (PCL-R).
METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing 
primary multiligament PCL-R at a single institution between 2008 and 2020. 
Multiligament PCL-R was defined as PCL-R and concurrent surgical treatment of 
one or more additional knee ligament(s). Exclusion criteria included isolated 
PCL-R, PCL repair, and missing data for any variable. Patients were dichotomized 
into early (≤ 12 weeks) and delayed (> 12 weeks) PCL-R groups based on the time 
elapsed between injury and surgery. Between-group comparison of variables were 
conducted with the Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and independent samples t-tests.
RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were eligible for analysis, with 57 (38.5%) 
patients in the early and 91 (61.1%) patients in the delayed multiligament PCL-R 
groups. Concomitant LCL/PLC reconstruction (LCL-R/PLC-R) was performed in 55 
(60%) of delayed multiligament PCL-Rs and 23 (40%) of early PCL-Rs (p = 0.02). 
Despite similar rates of meniscus injury, concomitant meniscus surgery was 
significantly more prevalent in the early (n = 25, 44%) versus delayed (n = 19, 
21%) multiligament PCL-R group (p = 0.003), with a significantly greater 
proportion of medial meniscus surgeries performed in the early (n = 16, 28%) 
compared to delayed (n = 13, 14%) PCL-R group (p = 0.04). The prevalence of knee 
cartilage injury was significantly different between the early (n = 12, 24%) and 
delayed (n = 41, 46%) multiligament PCL-R groups (p = 0.01), with more frequent 
involvement of the lateral (n = 17, 19% vs. n = 3, 5%, respectively; p = 0.04) 
and medial (n = 31, 34% vs. n = 6, 11%, respectively; p = 0.005) femoral 
condyles in the delayed compared to the early PCL-R group.
CONCLUSIONS: Given higher rates of chondral pathology and medial meniscus 
surgery seen in delayed multiligament PCL-R, early management of PCL-based 
multiligament knee injury is recommended to restore knee stability and 
potentially prevent the development of further intraarticular injury.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients are subject to severe skeletal muscle 
wasting during intensive care unit (ICU) stay, resulting in impaired short- and 
long-term functional outcomes and health-related quality of life. Increased 
protein provision may improve functional outcomes in ICU patients by attenuating 
skeletal muscle breakdown. Supporting evidence is limited however and results in 
great variety in recommended protein targets.
METHODS: The PRECISe trial is an investigator-initiated, bi-national, 
multi-center, quadruple-blinded randomized controlled trial with a parallel 
group design. In 935 patients, we will compare provision of isocaloric enteral 
nutrition with either a standard or high protein content, providing 1.3 or 2.0 g 
of protein/kg/day, respectively, when fed on target. All unplanned ICU 
admissions with initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation within 24 h of 
admission and an expected stay on ventilator support of at least 3 days are 
eligible. The study is designed to assess the effect of the intervention on 
functional recovery at 1, 3, and 6 months following ICU admission, including 
health-related quality of life, measures of muscle strength, physical function, 
and mental health. The primary endpoint of the trial is health-related quality 
of life as measured by the Euro-QoL-5D-5-level questionnaire Health Utility 
Score. Overall between-group differences will be assessed over the three time 
points using linear mixed-effects models.
DISCUSSION: The PRECISe trial will evaluate the effect of protein on functional 
recovery including both patient-centered and muscle-related outcomes.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing is a promising tool for 
cardiovascular risk prediction, but whether serial testing can dynamically 
predict risk is uncertain. We evaluated the trajectory of cardiac troponin I in 
the years prior to a cardiovascular event in the general population, and 
determine whether serial measurements could track risk within individuals.
METHODS: In the Whitehall II cohort, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I 
concentrations were measured on three occasions over a 15-year period. Time 
trajectories of troponin were constructed in those who died from cardiovascular 
disease compared to those who survived or died from other causes during follow 
up and these were externally validated in the HUNT Study. A joint model that 
adjusts for cardiovascular risk factors was used to estimate risk of 
cardiovascular death using serial troponin measurements.
RESULTS: In 7,293 individuals (mean 58 ± 7 years, 29.4% women) cardiovascular 
and non-cardiovascular death occurred in 281 (3.9%) and 914 (12.5%) individuals 
(median follow-up 21.4 years), respectively. Troponin concentrations increased 
in those dying from cardiovascular disease with a steeper trajectory compared to 
those surviving or dying from other causes in Whitehall and HUNT 
(Pinteraction < 0.05 for both). The joint model demonstrated an independent 
association between temporal evolution of troponin and risk of cardiovascular 
death (HR per doubling, 1.45, 95% CI,1.33-1.75).
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac troponin I concentrations increased in those dying from 
cardiovascular disease compared to those surviving or dying from other causes 
over the preceding decades. Serial cardiac troponin testing in the general 
population has potential to track future cardiovascular risk.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12916-023-02921-8

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: During the CoronaVIrus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, nursing education has 
been dramatically transformed and shaped according to the restrictions imposed 
by national rules. Restoring educational activities as delivered in the 
pre-pandemic era without making a critical evaluation of the transformations 
implemented, may sacrifice the extraordinary learning opportunity that this 
event has offered. The aim of this study was to identify a set of 
recommendations that can guide the Italian nursing education to move forward in 
the post-pandemic era.
METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was undertaken in 2022-2023 and 
reported here according to the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative 
research guidelines. A network was established of nine Italian universities 
offering a bachelor's degree in nursing for a total of 6135 students. A 
purposeful sample of 37 Faculty Members, 28 Clinical Nurse Educators and 65 
Students/new graduates were involved. A data collection was conducted with a 
form including open-ended questions concerning which transformations in nursing 
education had been implemented during the pandemic, which of these should be 
maintained and valued, and what recommendations should address the transition of 
nursing education in the post-pandemic era.
RESULTS: Nine main recommendations embodying 18 specific recommendations have 
emerged, all transversally influenced by the role of the digital transformation, 
as a complementary and strengthening strategy for face-to-face teaching. The 
findings also suggest the need to rethink clinical rotations and their 
supervision models, to refocus the clinical learning aims, to pay attention 
towards the student community and its social needs, and to define a pandemic 
educational plan to be ready for unexpected, but possible, future events.
CONCLUSIONS: A multidimensional set of recommendations emerged, shaping a 
strategic map of action, where the main message is the need to rethink the whole 
nursing education, where digitalization is embodied. Preparing and moving 
nursing education forward by following the emerged recommendations may promote 
common standards of education and create the basis on for how to deal with 
future pandemic/catastrophic events by making ready and prepared the educational 
systems.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12909-023-04402-1

changes in social isolation and depressive symptoms is largely unknown. This 
study examined the association between changes in social isolation and 
depressive symptoms among survivors who experienced earthquake damage in the 
aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE).
METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal data from 10,314 participants who responded to 
self-report questionnaires on the Lubben Social Network Scale-6 (LSNS-6) and the 
Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depressive Scale (CES-D) in both the baseline 
survey (FY2013 to FY2015) and follow-up survey (FY2017 to FY2019) after the 
GEJE. According to changes in the presence of social isolation (< 12 of LSNS-6) 
at two time points, participants were categorized into four groups: ""not 
socially isolated,"" ""improved socially isolated,"" ""newly socially isolated,"" and 
""continuously socially isolated."" At the follow-up survey, a CES-D score of ≥ 16 
indicates the presence of depressive symptoms. The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) 
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the logistic regression 
analysis to examine the influence of the change in social isolation over four 
years on depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: Participants who were newly socially isolated had a significantly 
higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than those who were not socially 
isolated (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.61 - 2.23). In addition, AORs were highest for 
those who were continuously socially isolated and had experienced house damage 
(AOR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.73 - 2.72) and those who were newly socially isolated 
and had not experienced the death of family members due to the GEJE (AOR = 1.88, 
95%CI = 1.60 - 2.22).
CONCLUSION: Our longitudinal findings suggest that being newly or continuously 
socially isolated is associated with a risk of depressive symptoms, not only 
among those who had experienced house damage or the death of a family member, 
but also those who had not, in the disaster-affected area. Our study underlines 
the clinical importance of social isolation after a large-scale natural disaster 
and draws attention to the need for appropriate prevention measures.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-16082-z

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) is an emerging therapy for type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although its effect on glucose control has been 
confirmed in previous clinical trials, most of those studies have focused on 
comparing calorie-restricted LCD to iso-caloric low-fat diets. In this study, we 
aim to compare the effects of LCD and canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in patients with T2DM.
METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. We will recruit 120 
patients with poor-controlled T2DM. Participants will be randomly divided into 
canagliflozin and LCD groups in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the change 
in hemoglobin A1C levels after the 3-month intervention. The secondary outcomes 
are the time in range and cost of antihyperglycemic agents. Exploratory outcomes 
include physical examination, body composition, glucose variability, appetite, 
glycolipid metabolism, liver lipid content, and urine glucose threshold.
DISCUSSION: No previous study has compared an LCD with antihyperglycemic agents. 
In LoCaT, participants' metabolism will be assessed from multiple perspectives. 
It is believed that the finding obtained from this trial will optimize the 
treatments for patients with T2DM.

amidst the heroic roles they have played during the peak of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Nurses stood tall among their peers in the healthcare industry saving 
lives. The pandemic has had a toll on nurses physically, psychologically, and 
socio-economically. The numerous deaths have traumatized nurses coupled with the 
fear of possible infection. Nurses have seen their colleagues and loved ones 
lose their lives to the pandemic, nevertheless, they still render care to 
patients no matter the circumstances. Due to that, it is imperative to ascertain 
the extent to which nurses who are much needed in healthcare delivery have been 
affected by this pandemic. This scoping review used Arksey and O'Malley's review 
methodology to investigate the nature of work-related psychosocial challenges 
nurses encountered during the peak of the pandemic, noting the major 
contributors to the challenges and the coping strategies used to address them.
METHODS: We performed a scoping review and searched for articles from five 
databases including PUBMED, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Grey literature 
from December 2019 to December 2021. A total of 7,334 articles were retrieved 
for the study but 45 met the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Work-related psychosocial challenges identified included stress, 
burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization), Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder, depression, sleeplessness, and anxiety. Factors that accounted for the 
challenges were inadequate personal protective equipment (PPEs), discomfort 
using the PPEs, extreme workload, and fatigue. Nurses experienced job 
insecurity, business closure, and separation from family and loved ones, and 
these contributed to their challenges. Strategies used to deal with the 
challenges centred on emotion-focused and problem-focused coping.
CONCLUSIONS: The study recommends regular counselling and support for all nurses 
working at the frontline to help them better cope with the devastating effects 
of the pandemic so that they could build resilience towards future pandemics.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12912-023-01368-9

formulations must be updated in accordance with their needs. Furthermore, a 
different drug formulation may be also needed for patients who require a very 
low dosage which is not easily reachable with those of the industrial products 
or for those following a ketogenic diet. Galenic (or compounded) drugs have been 
recently pointed out as effective in treating children. Nonetheless, their 
knowledge among healthcare providers is limited. We investigated how much did 
pediatricians know about galenic compounds by a short questionnaire administered 
to family and hospital pediatricians and pediatric residents in Friuli Venezia 
Giulia, Italy. We collected answers from 65 family pediatricians (57,5%), 39 
hospital pediatricians (36,1%), and 47 pediatric residents (41,2%). Overall, 
both family and hospital pediatricians substantially know what is a galenic 
compound and the indications to its use. Of note, most of pediatricians ignore 
which is the legislation that allows the galenic compounds' preparation and use, 
and which is the correct procedure to prescribe them. Moreover, half of the 
hospital pediatricians and one-third of the family ones erroneously stated that 
galenic formulations cost more or like the industrial products, and around the 
15% of both categories affirmed that galenic compounds are less safe than the 
commercial product. In conclusion, the use of galenic drug may significantly 
improve children's and caregivers' quality of life. We believe that all 
pediatricians should be updated on this quite new and interesting topic.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13052-023-01462-3

potentially causing an international threat. The desire to defend against a 
potential outbreak has led to renewed efforts to develop Mpox vaccines. In this 
report, mice were immunized with various doses of modified vaccinia virus Ankara 
(MVA) to evaluate the cross-reactive immune response of MVA immunization against 
protective antigens of the current monkeypox virus. We demonstrated that MVA 
induced specific antibodies against protective antigens (A29, A35, B6, M1, H3, 
and I1), mediating the neutralization abilities against the MVA and the 
monkeypox virus (MPXV). Moreover, recombinant protective antigens of the MPXV 
elicited cross-binding and cross-neutralizing activities for MVA. Hence, the MVA 
induced cross-reactive immune responses, which may guide future efforts to 
develop vaccines against the recent MPXV. Notably, compared to the other 
protective antigens, the predominant A29 and M1 antigens mediated higher 
cross-neutralizing immune responses against the MVA, which could serve as

become increasingly professionalised. However, evaluation remains challenging 
and often insufficiently documented in the literature. Many, particularly 
small-scale health system evaluations, are conducted by government bodies or 
non-governmental organisations (NGO) with limited capacity to publish their 
experiences. It is essential to identify the existing literature and main 
findings as a baseline for future efforts to evaluate the capacity and 
resilience of conflict-affected health systems. We thus aimed to synthesise the 
scope of methodological approaches and methods used in the peer-reviewed 
literature on health system evaluation in conflict-affected settings.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley's method and 
synthesised findings using the WHO health system 'building blocks' framework.
RESULTS: We included 58 eligible sources of 2,355 screened, which included 
examination of health systems or components in 26 conflict-affected countries, 
primarily South Sudan and Afghanistan (7 sources each), Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (6), and Palestine (5). Most sources (86%) were led by foreign 
academic institutes and international donors and focused on health services 
delivery (78%), with qualitative designs predominating (53%). Theoretical or 
conceptual grounding was extremely limited and study designs were not generally 
complex, as many sources (43%) were NGO project evaluations for international 
donors and relied on simple and lower-cost methods. Sources were also limited in 
terms of geography (e.g., limited coverage of the Americas region), by component 
(e.g., preferences for specific components such as service delivery), gendered 
(e.g., limited participation of women), and colonised (e.g., limited authorship 
and research leadership from affected countries).
CONCLUSION: The evaluation literature in conflict-affected settings remains 
limited in scope and content, favouring simplified study designs and methods, 
and including those components and projects implemented or funded 
internationally. Many identified challenges and limitations (e.g., limited 
innovation/contextualisation, poor engagement with local actors, gender and 
language biases) could be mitigated with more rigorous and systematic evaluation 
approaches.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13031-023-00526-9

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Tianhuang formula (THF) is a Chinese medicine prescription that is 
patented and clinically approved, and has been shown to improve energy 
metabolism, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The purpose 
of this study is to clarify the potential mechanisms of THF in the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: A murine model of T2DM was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding 
combined with low-dose streptozocin (STZ) injections, and the diabetic mice were 
treated with THF by gavaging for consecutive 10 weeks. Fasting blood glucose 
(FBG), serum insulin, blood lipid, mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+) levels and 
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as ATP production were analyzed. 
The target genes and proteins expression of visceral adipose tissue (Vat) was 
tested by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The underlying mechanism of the 
regulating energy metabolism effect of THF was further explored in the insulin 
resistance model of 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured with dexamethasone (DXM).
RESULTS: THF restored impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in 
diabetic mice. Serum levels of lipids were significantly decreased, as well as 
fasting blood glucose and insulin in THF-treated mice. THF regulated mCa2+ 
uptake, increased MMP and ATP content in VAT. THF increased the mRNA and protein 
expression of AMPK, phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), MICU1, sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). THF could 
increase the mCa2+ level of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and regulate mitochondrial 
function. The protein expression of AMPK, p-AMPK, mCa2+ uniporter (MCU) and 
MICU1 decreased upon adding AMPK inhibitor compound C to 3T3-L1 adipocytes and 
the protein expression of MCU and MICU1 decreased upon adding the MCU inhibitor 
ruthenium red.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that THF ameliorated glucose and lipid 
metabolism disorders in T2DM mice through the improvement of AMPK/MICU1 
pathway-dependent mitochondrial function in adipose tissue.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12906-023-04009-5

participate in various human cancers. Nevertheless, the function of PSMD3 in 
lung cancer (LC) remains unclear.
METHODS: RT-qPCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of PSMD3 in 
LC tissues form TCGA database and clinical samples, and LC cell lines. To study 
the effect of PSMD3 on LC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
apoptosis, siRNAs targeting PSMD3 were synthesized and overexpressed plasmids 
were constructed. CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, and etc. were used to evaluate 
the results. Tumor xenograft model was used to evaluate the function of PSMD3 on 
tumor growth. CO-IP and MS were used to scan the proteins that bind with PSMD3. 
The interaction between PSMD3 and ILF3 in lung cancer cells were studied using 
IF staining, CHX protein stability, and ubiquitination assay. Additionally, the 
effect of ILF3 on cell progression and LC tumor growth was demonstrated by 
conducting a recovery assay using siILF3 and an ILF3 inhibitor YM155.
RESULTS: We observed that PSMD3 was significantly overexpressed in LC tissues 
and cells, which indicated a poor prognosis. Meanwhile, we found that PSMD3 
promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of LC cells. We also 
determined that PSMD3 stabilized the protein expression of ILF3 and the 
deubiquitination of ILF3 in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, animal experiments 
showed that the ILF3 inhibitor YM155 could suppress tumor growth with the 
presence of PSMD3.
CONCLUSIONS: PSMD3 collectively regulated the stability of ILF3 protein and 
facilitated the ubiquitination of endogenous ILF3 in LC, which ultimately 
promoted the progression of LC cells. The PSMD3/ ILF3 axis could potentially be 
used as a novel strategy for both diagnosis and treatment of LC.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13062-023-00389-3

eye condition with complex genetic and environmental etiologies. Genetic testing 
for AMD for previously identified multiple-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms 
can help determine an individual's future susceptibility. However, such testing 
has been discouraged until evidence shows that providing such information to 
symptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals will alter their disease course. 
Therefore, we designed this study to investigate whether knowledge of AMD risk 
could stimulate the adoption of a healthier lifestyle that could lower the 
incidence of AMD later in life. We hypothesize that pre-symptomatic individuals 
informed of a high genetic risk of AMD are more likely to make quantifiable, 
positive lifestyle changes relative to participants informed of lower genetic 
risk or randomized to deferred disclosure of genetic testing results.
METHODS: The Moran AMD Genetic Testing Assessment (MAGENTA) study is a phase 2, 
single-center, prospective, double-masked, randomized controlled trial conducted 
at the John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. 
Participants are randomized by a 3:1 allocation ratio to immediate and deferred 
disclosure groups and followed for 12 months. Skin, ocular, and serum carotenoid 
status, as well as nutritional and social surveys, are assessed at study visits. 
Skin carotenoid assessment is by resonance Raman spectroscopy and reflectance 
spectroscopy, ocular carotenoids are measured with Heidelberg Spectralis 
autofluorescence imaging and fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy 
(FLIO), and serum carotenoids are quantified using high-performance liquid 
chromatography. The primary outcome evaluates changes in skin carotenoid status 
in response to genetic risk disclosure. The secondary outcomes examine changes 
in ocular and serum carotenoid status in response to genetic risk disclosure. 
Also, we will correlate AMD genetic risk with baseline ocular and systemic 
carotenoid status and FLIO.
DISCUSSION: MAGENTA will provide much-needed evidence on whether pre-symptomatic 
testing for AMD risk can lead to quantifiable long-term changes in behavior and 
lifestyle associated with a lower incidence of AMD later in life. Findings from 
the MAGENTA trial will facilitate the design of a future larger, longer-term, 
multicenter phase 3 trial that could feature subgroup analysis, expanded 
measures of lifestyle modification, and potential active nutritional 
interventions.

control programs. Mosquito-biting risks are affected by environmental, mosquito 
behavior and human factors, which are important for assessing exposure risk and 
intervention impacts. This study estimated malaria transmission risk based on 
vector-human interactions in northern Ghana, where indoor residual spraying 
(IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) have been deployed.
METHODS: Indoor and outdoor human biting rates (HBRs) were measured using 
monthly human landing catches (HLCs) from June 2017 to April 2019. Mosquitoes 
collected were identified to species level, and Anopheles gambiae sensu lato 
(An. gambiae s.l.) samples were examined for parity and infectivity. The HBRs 
were adjusted using mosquito parity and human behavioral observations.
RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae was the main vector species in the IRS (81%) and 
control (83%) communities. Indoor and outdoor HBRs were similar in both the IRS 
intervention (10.6 vs. 11.3 bites per person per night [b/p/n]; 
z = -0.33, P = 0.745) and control communities (18.8 vs. 16.4 b/p/n; 
z = 1.57, P = 0.115). The mean proportion of parous An. gambiae s.l. was lower 
in IRS communities (44.6%) than in control communities (71.7%). After adjusting 
for human behavior observations and parity, the combined effect of IRS and ITN 
utilization (IRS: 37.8%; control: 57.3%) on reducing malaria transmission risk 
was 58% in IRS + ITN communities and 27% in control communities with ITNs alone 
(z = -4.07, P < 0.001). However, this also revealed that about 41% and 31% of 
outdoor adjusted bites in IRS and control communities respectively, occurred 
before bed time (10:00 pm). The mean directly measured annual entomologic 
inoculation rates (EIRs) during the study were 6.1 infective bites per person 
per year (ib/p/yr) for IRS communities and 16.3 ib/p/yr for control communities. 
After considering vector survival and observed human behavior, the estimated EIR 
for IRS communities was 1.8 ib/p/yr, which represents about a 70% overestimation 
of risk compared to the directly measured EIR; for control communities, it was 
13.6 ib/p/yr (16% overestimation).
CONCLUSION: Indoor residual spraying significantly impacted entomological 
indicators of malaria transmission. The results of this study indicate that 
vector bionomics alone do not provide an accurate assessment of malaria 
transmission exposure risk. By accounting for human behavior parameters, we 
found that high coverage of ITNs alone had less impact on malaria transmission 
indices than combining ITNs with IRS, likely due to observed low net use. 
Reinforcing effective communication for behavioral change in net use and IRS 
could further reduce malaria transmission.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13071-023-05793-2

randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
DESIGN: A screening tool was developed using the four-stage approach proposed by 
Moher et al. This included defining the scope, reviewing the evidence base, 
suggesting a list of items from piloting, and holding a consensus meeting. The 
initial checklist was set-up by a core group who had been involved in the 
assessment of problematic RCTs for several years. We piloted this in a consensus 
panel of several stakeholders, including health professionals, reviewers, 
journal editors, policymakers, researchers, and evidence-synthesis specialists. 
Each member was asked to score three articles with the checklist and the results 
were then discussed in consensus meetings.
OUTCOME: The Trustworthiness in RAndomised Clinical Trials (TRACT) checklist 
includes 19 items organised into seven domains that are applicable to every RCT: 
1) Governance, 2) Author Group, 3) Plausibility of Intervention Usage, 4) 
Timeframe, 5) Drop-out Rates, 6) Baseline Characteristics, and 7) Outcomes. Each 
item can be answered as either no concerns, some concerns/no information, or 
major concerns. If a study is assessed and found to have a majority of items 
rated at a major concern level, then editors, reviewers or evidence synthesizers 
should consider a more thorough investigation, including assessment of original 
individual participant data.
CONCLUSIONS: The TRACT checklist is the first checklist developed specifically 
to detect trustworthiness issues in RCTs. It might help editors, publishers and 
researchers to screen for such issues in submitted or published RCTs in a

approach to therapeutic regeneration. Therapeutic persistence and reduced 
functional stem cells following cell delivery remain critical hurdles for 
clinical investigation due to the senescence of freshly isolated cells and 
extensive in-vitro passage.
METHODS: Cultured adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were derived from 
subcutaneous white adipose tissue isolated from mice fed a normal diet. We 
performed senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, real-time 
PCR, and Westernblot to evaluate the levels related to cellular senescence 
markers.
RESULTS: The mRNA expression levels of senescence markers were significantly 
increased in the later passage of ASCs. We show that light activation reduced 
the expression of senescent genes, and SA-β-Gal in all cells at passages. 
Moreover, the light-activated ASCs-derived exosomes decrease the expression of 
senescence, and SA-β-Gal in the later passage cells. We further investigated the 
photoreceptive effect of Opsin3 (Opn3) in light-activated ASCs. Deletion of Opn3 
abolished the differences of light activation in reduced expression of senescent 
genes, increased Ca 2+ influx, and cAMP levels.
CONCLUSIONS: ASCs can undergo cellular senescence in-vitro passage. 
Photomodulation might be better preserved over senescence and Opn3-dependent 
activation in aged ASCs. Light-activated ASCs-derived exosomes could be served 
as e a new protective paradigm for cellular senescence in-vitro passage. Video

use of Maryland forceps (MF) and electrocoagulation hooks (EH) in da Vinci 
robot-assisted thoracoscopic mediastinal tumor resection.
METHODS: Retrospectively analyze 84 patients with mediastinal tumors who 
underwent robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) at the Department of 
Thoracic Surgery in Gansu Provincial Hospital from February 2019 to February 
2023. Two groups were divided according to the intraoperative use of energy 
devices, including 41 cases in the MF group and 43 cases in the EH group. 
Perioperative clinical data was gathered to compare the short-term efficacy of 
patients in both groups.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics such 
as sex (P = 0.685), age (P = 0.165), and tumor size (P = 0.339) between the two 
groups. Compared with the EH group, patients in the MF group have shorter 
operative time (P = 0.030), less intraoperative bleeding (P = 0.010), less total 
postoperative drainage volume (P = 0.001), shorter postoperative drainage time 
(P = 0.022), shorter hospital stay (P = 0.019), and lower levels of 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), 
and cortisol. No statistically significant differences were found between the 
two groups in terms of total hospitalization costs (P = 0.123), postoperative 
visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores (P = 0.064), and postoperative 
complications (P = 0.431).
CONCLUSION: Using MF in RATS for mediastinal tumor is safe and effective, which 
can reduce the amount of bleeding, reduce the degree of inflammatory reaction, 
and conducive to the quick recovery of patients.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12957-023-03065-y

and young adults. Most states with recreational cannabis lack policies regarding 
social media-based marketing. Thus, we examined such policies among prominent 
platforms, particularly those popular among youth and young adults.
METHODS: In September-October 2022, 3 research team members extracted policies 
applying to the general community, advertising, and any specific content 
regarding drug-related content for 11 social media sites: Discord, Facebook, 
Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Tumblr, Twitch, Twitter, and 
YouTube. Using inductive thematic analysis, they then dual-coded restrictions on 
cannabis-related content (e.g., paid advertising, unpaid promotion, sales). 
Descriptive analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Ten (all except TikTok) referenced cannabis/marijuana, 7 (all except 
Discord, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube) distinguished different 
cannabis-derived products, and 5 (Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Tumblr, Twitter) 
noted jurisdictional differences in cannabis regulations/legality. All 
prohibited sales, 9 (all except Snapchat and Tumblr) prohibited paid 
advertising, and 4 (Discord, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok) prohibited unpaid 
promotion (e.g., user-generated content). All restricted underage access to 
cannabis-related content. However, policies varied and were ambiguous regarding 
how ""promotion"" was defined, whether/how jurisdictional differences in legality 
were addressed, how businesses may interact on social media, barriers 
implemented to inhibit the facilitation of sales, and enforcement protocols.
CONCLUSIONS: Social media policies regarding cannabis marketing are ambiguous 
and may facilitate cannabis marketing, promotion, sales, and underage exposure, 
thus compounding concerns regarding insufficient governmental regulations.

quality of life among women in reproductive age have been huge. However, sources 
of such inequalities were not studied well. Therefore, this study aimed to 
assess inequalities in health-related quality of life among women residing in 
urban and rural areas in four regions of Ethiopia.
METHODS: This study used data extracted from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and 
Health Survey; collected at national level from January 18, 2016, to June 27, 
2016. Stratified two stage cluster sampling method were used. The data collected 
from 2385 women in the age group 15-49 years who were living in four regions 
(Afar, Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambela, and Somali regions) of Ethiopia were used for 
this study. The outcome variable, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), was 
generated by Principal Component Analysis. Further, Multivariable Ordinary Least 
Square and Oaxaca decomposition threefold (interaction) were used in the 
analysis with a p-value less than 0.05 and 95% confidence interval to declare 
statistical significances.
RESULTS: Women education, region, religion, wealth index, and husband/partner 
education were identified as predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life. Women 
residing in rural areas had far lower health-related quality of life than those 
living in urban areas. The wealth index and educational level of women were the 
largest contributor of the inequality in health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: A substantial inequality in quality of life exist between women who 
reside in rural and urban areas in those four regions of Ethiopia. The 
socioeconomic factors more importantly wealth index and educational attainment 
explained the significant portion of the reported rural-urban disparities. 
Therefore, Policymakers and local administrators should pay more attention on 
interventions that promote education and narrowing gap in wealth in rural and 
urban settings.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12905-023-02465-2

effective communication between disciplines, however strategies to address the 
gap between information sharing and knowledge transfer are still under 
exploration. Communities of Practice (CoP) are informal networks of stakeholders 
with shared knowledge or endeavour and present an opportunity to address this 
gap beyond disciplinary boundaries. However, the evidence-base supporting their 
development, implementation and efficacy in health is not well described. This 
review explores the evidence underpinning the use of CoP in health research and 
translation.
METHODS: A scoping review was undertaken using Arksey and O'Malley's 
methodological framework. A comprehensive search of health databases and grey 
literature was performed using keywords and controlled vocabulary. Studies were 
not restricted by date or research method.
RESULTS: A total of 1355 potentially relevant articles were identified through 
the global search strategy. Following screening, six articles were retained for 
analysis. Included studies were published between 2002 and 2013 in the United 
Kingdom (n = 3), Canada (n = 2) and Italy (n = 1). Three papers reported primary 
research; one used a quantitative methodology, one a qualitative, and one a 
descriptive evaluation approach. The three remaining papers explored seminal and 
evolving theories of CoP in the context of knowledge transfer and translation to 
the health sector.
CONCLUSIONS: A paucity of evidence exists regarding the development and efficacy 
of CoP in health research and translation. Further empirical research is 
required to determine if communities of practice can enhance the translation of

proliferation. The tumor suppressor Merlin and large tumor suppressor kinase 1 
(LATS1) mediate activation of Hippo pathway, consequently inhibiting the primary 
effectors, Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with 
PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid 
present in the plasma membrane (PM), binds to and activates Merlin. 
Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase α (PIP5Kα) is an enzyme responsible 
for PIP2 production. However, the functional role of PIP5Kα in regulation of 
Merlin and LATS1 under Hippo signaling conditions remains unclear.
METHODS: PIP5Kα, Merlin, or LATS1 knockout or knockdown cells and transfected 
cells with them were used. LATS1, YAP, and TAZ activities were measured using 
biochemical methods and PIP2 levels were evaluated using cell imaging. Low/high 
cell density and serum starvation/stimulation conditions were tested. 
Colocalization of PIP5Kα and PIP2 with Merlin and LATS1, and their protein 
interactions were examined using transfection, confocal imaging, 
immunoprecipitation, western blotting, and/or pull-down experiments. Colony 
formation and adipocyte differentiation assays were performed.
RESULTS: We found that PIP5Kα induced LATS1 activation and YAP/TAZ inhibition in 
a kinase activity-dependent manner. Consistent with these findings, PIP5Kα 
suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced adipocyte differentiation of 
mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, PIP5Kα protein stability and PIP2 levels were 
elevated at high cell density compared with those at low cell density, and both 
PIP2 and YAP phosphorylation levels initially declined, then recovered upon 
serum stimulation. Under these conditions, YAP/TAZ activity was aberrantly 
regulated by PIP5Kα deficiency. Mechanistically, either Merlin deficiency or 
LATS1 deficiency abrogated PIP5Kα-mediated YAP/TAZ inactivation. Additionally, 
the catalytic domain of PIP5Kα directly interacted with the band 
4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin domain of Merlin, and this interaction reinforced 
interaction of Merlin with LATS1. In accordance with these findings, PIP5Kα and 
PIP2 colocalized with Merlin and LATS1 in the PM. In PIP5Kα-deficient cells, 
Merlin colocalization with PIP2 was reduced, and LATS1 solubility increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results support that PIP5Kα serves as an 
activator of the Hippo pathway through interaction and colocalization with 
Merlin, which promotes PIP2-dependent Merlin activation and induces local 
recruitment of LATS1 to the PIP2-rich PM and its activation, thereby negatively 
regulating YAP/TAZ activity. Video Abstract.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12964-023-01161-w

care, the society, and the wellbeing of the general practitioner. There has been 
research into the reasons for participation in continuous medical education, but 
little is known about the barriers to participation. To tailor continuous 
medical education targeting general practitioners who are currently deselecting 
education, systematic knowledge of the barriers is needed. Continuous medical 
education can in addition to professional growth stimulate job satisfaction, 
diminish burnout, and reinforce feelings of competence. Continuous medical 
education may have positive implications for patients and for healthcare 
expenditures. Despite renumeration and a comprehensive continuous education 
model some Danish general practitioners do not participate in continuous medical 
education.
METHODS: From a total of 3440 Danish general practitioners 243 did not apply for 
reimbursement for accredited continuous medical education in a two-year period. 
Ten general practitioners were selected for an interview regarding maximum 
variation in practice form, number of listed patients, seniority as a general 
practitioner, geography, gender, and age. All ten selected general practitioners 
accepted to be interviewed. The interviews were analysed using Systematic Text 
Condensation.
RESULTS: Each of the ten interviewed general practitioners mentioned several 
barriers for participating in continuous education. The barriers fell into three 
main categories: barriers related to the individual general practitioner 
barriers related to the clinic barriers related to the accredited continuous 
medical education offered CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 7% of the Danish general 
practitioners did not participate in accredited remunerated continuous medical 
education. A knowledge of the barriers for participating in accredited 
continuous medical education can be used to better target continuous medical 
education to the general practitioners.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12909-023-04432-9

registrations of active lobbyists; expenditure on lobbying; meetings; written 
comments and submissions made to government consultations; bills; and committee 
participation. A range of different data sources were used to analyse lobbying, 
including from governments, not-for-profits and commercial sources. All 15 
studies analysing lobbyist meetings were from high-income contexts. The studies 
analysed three key variables: the types of government actors targeted by 
lobbying; the policies of interest; and the lobbyists and/or their clients. The 
studies used a range of taxonomies to classify policy issues and the types of 
actors engaged in lobbying. All studies discussed challenges with accessing and 
analysing lobbying data.
CONCLUSIONS: There is enormous potential for public health research and advocacy 
concerned with commercial lobbying to learn from political science scholarship. 
This includes both conceptual frameworks and sources of empirical data. 
Moreover, the absence of good quality transparency internationally emphasises 
the importance of advocacy to support policy change to improve the quality of 
political transparency to make it easier to monitor commercial lobbying.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12961-023-01011-8

falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in South Asia and the Middle East. The spread 
of An. stephensi to countries within the Horn of Africa threatens progress in 
malaria control in this region as well as the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: The available malaria data and the timeline for the detection of An. 
stephensi was reviewed to analyse the role of An. stephensi in malaria 
transmission in Horn of Africa of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) in 
Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
RESULTS: Malaria incidence in Horn of Africa of EMR and Yemen, increased from 
41.6 in 2015 to 61.5 cases per 1000 in 2020. The four countries from this 
region, Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen had reported the detection of An. 
stephensi as of 2021. In Djibouti City, following its detection in 2012, the 
estimated incidence increased from 2.5 cases per 1000 in 2013 to 97.6 cases per 
1000 in 2020. However, its contribution to malaria transmission in other major 
cities and in other countries, is unclear because of other factors, quality of 
the urban malaria data, human mobility, uncertainty about the actual arrival 
time of An. stephensi and poor entomological surveillance.
CONCLUSIONS: While An. stephensi may explain a resurgence of malaria in 
Djibouti, further investigations are needed to understand its interpretation 
trends in urban malaria across the greater region. More investment for 
multisectoral approach and integrated surveillance and control should target all 
vectors particularly malaria and dengue vectors to guide interventions in urban 
areas.",© 2023. World Health Organization.,"DOI: 10.1186/s12936-023-04545-y

caregivers' skills. In 2020, the Veterans Health Administration Caregiver 
Support Program (CSP) nationally endorsed Caregivers FIRST, offering credit in 
leadership performance plans to encourage all VA medical centers (VAMCs) to 
implement locally. This study examines the association of organizational 
readiness with VAMC adoption of Caregivers FIRST.
METHODS: In a cohort observational study, we surveyed CSP managers about their 
facilities' readiness to implement using the Organizational Readiness for 
Implementing Change (ORIC) instrument and compared change commitment and change 
efficacy domains among VAMCs ""adopters"" defined as delivering Caregivers FIRST 
within 1 year of the national announcement to those that did not 
(""non-adopters""). Within ""adopters,"" we categorized time to adoption based on 
Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory including ""innovators,"" ""early adopters,"" 
""early majority,"" ""late adopters,"" and ""laggards."" Organizational readiness and 
site characteristics (facility complexity, staffing levels, volume of 
applications for caregiver assistance services) were compared between 
""adopters,"" ""non-adopters,"" and between time to adoption subcategories. Separate 
logistic regression models were used to assess whether ORIC and site 
characteristics were associated with early adoption among ""adopters.""
RESULTS: Fifty-one of 63 (81%) VAMCs with CSP manager survey respondents adopted 
Caregivers FIRST during the first year. ORIC change commitment and efficacy were 
similar for ""adopters"" and ""non-adopters."" However, sites that adopted earlier 
(innovators and early adopters) had higher ORIC change commitment and efficacy 
scores than the rest of the ""adopters."" Logistic regression results indicated 
that higher ORIC change commitment (odds ratio [OR] = 2.57; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.11-5.95) and ORIC change efficacy (OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 
1.12-6.03) scores were associated with increased odds that a VAMC was an early 
adopter (categorized as an ""innovator,"" ""early adopter"", or ""early majority""). 
Site-level characteristics were not associated with Caregivers FIRST early 
adoption.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first to prospectively assess 
organizational readiness and the timing of subsequent program adoption. Early 
adoption was associated with higher ORIC change commitment and change efficacy 
and not site-level characteristics. These findings yield insights into the role 
of organizational readiness to accelerate program adoption.

face challenges of limited integration into the health system, limited workforce 
capacity, mismatch of workforce to population need and poor quality of care. In 
recognition of these challenges, coupled with a gap in existing tools, provides 
a strong rationale for the development of the Eye care competency framework 
(ECCF).
METHODS: A mixed methods approach was utilised to develop and validate the ECCF. 
Content was developed by extracting relevant components of existing frameworks 
used both within and outside of eye care. A diverse technical working group 
provided feedback and guidance on the structure, design, and content to create a 
preliminary draft. Competencies and activities were validated using a 
modified-Delphi study, and the framework was then piloted at four sites to 
understand how the tool can be implemented in different settings.
RESULTS: The final version of the ECCF included eight outcomes, nine guiding 
principles, and content of each of the key elements, including the six domains, 
22 competencies, 21 activities, 193 behaviours and 234 tasks, and the knowledge 
and skills that underpin them. 95/112 participants from the six WHO regions 
completed the modified-Delphi study, yielding an average of 96% agreement across 
the competencies and activities in the ECCF. The pilot showcased the versatility 
and flexibility of the ECCF, where each of the four sites had a different 
experience in implementing the ECCF. All sites found that the ECCF enabled them 
to identify gaps within their current workforce documentation.
CONCLUSIONS: The ECCF was developed using a collaborative approach, reflecting 
the opinions of participants and stakeholders from all around the world. The 
comprehensive competencies and activities developed in the ECCF encompass the 
diverse roles of eye care workers, and thus encourage multi-disciplinary care 
and better integration into the health system. It is recommended that eye care 
workforce planners and developers use the ECCF, and adapt it to their context, 
to support workforce development and focus on the quality and scope of eye care 
service provision.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12960-023-00834-4

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Seed oil content is an important agronomic trait of Brassica napus 
(B. napus), and metabolites are considered as the bridge between genotype and 
phenotype for physical traits.
RESULTS: Using a widely targeted metabolomics analysis in a natural population 
of 388 B. napus inbred lines, we quantify 2172 metabolites in mature seeds by 
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, in which 131 marker metabolites are 
identified to be correlated with seed oil content. These metabolites are then 
selected for further metabolite genome-wide association study and metabolite 
transcriptome-wide association study. Combined with weighted correlation network 
analysis, we construct a triple relationship network, which includes 21,000 
edges and 4384 nodes among metabolites, metabolite quantitative trait loci, 
genes, and co-expression modules. We validate the function of BnaA03.TT4, 
BnaC02.TT4, and BnaC05.UK, three candidate genes predicted by multi-omics 
analysis, which show significant impacts on seed oil content through regulating 
flavonoid metabolism in B. napus.

Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), the overuse of 
prescription drugs to manage COPD, particularly inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), 
remains a persistent challenge. In this real-world study, we evaluated how 
patients with COPD were divided into ABCD groups based on the 2017 GOLD 
guidelines, determined the rate of adherence to the GOLD treatment 
recommendations, described the rate of ICS usage, and determined the rate of 
triple therapy (TT) prescription.
METHODS: The charts of 2291 patients diagnosed with COPD were retrospectively 
analyzed, of which 1438 matched the eligibility criteria.
RESULTS: The average patient age was 69.6 ± 10.9 years; 52% of patients were 
female. The average COPD assessment test (CAT) score was 18.3 ± 9.1. The ABCD 
breakdown was as follows: group A 19.5%, group B 64.1%, group C 1.8%, and group 
D 14.6%. All groups, except group D, showed discordance in COPD treatment 
relative to the proposed GOLD guidelines. Only 18.9% of group A and 26% of group 
B were treated in concordance with the guidelines. TT was primarily used in 
group D (63.3%) and overused in groups A (30.6%) and B (47.8%). ICS was overused 
in all groups, particularly in groups A (56.2%) and B (67.3%).
CONCLUSION: Studies from the last decade have consistently revealed a lack of 
conformity between what physicians prescribe and what GOLD guidelines recommend. 
The excessive usage of ICS, which continues despite all the associated adverse 
effects and the attributable costs, is concerning. The awareness of GOLD 
guidelines among primary care physicians (PCPs) and respiratory specialists 
needs to be improved.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12890-023-02503-7

deficit in older adults and may lead to quality-of-life deterioration. However, 
few studies have been performed in low/middle-income countries, particularly in 
Latin America. This study aimed to assess the audiological benefit, quality of 
life, and factors associated with functional gain in elderly hearing aid users 
in the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and UNIMEQ-ORL, two otology referral centers 
in Colombia.
DESIGN: Pre-post study that included hearing aid users at the otology consult of 
the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and UNIMEQ-ORL between June 2017 and December 
2020. Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) and Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid 
Benefit (APHAB) questionnaires were applied. Audiometric (0,5 kHz to 4 kHz) and 
speech audiometry results were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 75 participants (132 ears) were included. The mean age was 
70.73 years (SD: 12.66). The median hearing aid use in years was 0.71 (IQR: 
0.64-0.90). Mean change in speech audiometry was - 26.53dB (95%CI: -28.09, 
-24.97; p < 0.001), in functional gain was - 21.75dB (-23.81, -19.68; 
p < 0.001). The mean changes in the APHAB domains were Ease of Communication: 
-37.85 (95%CI: -43.01; -32.7), Background Noise: -3.51 (-6.06; -0.95), and 
Aversiveness of Sounds: -6.9 (-2.04; 11.77). The GBI assessment of quality of 
life showed improvement in 100% of the population after the use of hearing aids. 
The number of years of hearing aids use was associated with functional gain.
CONCLUSION: The number of years of hearing aids use may impact on the functional 
gain in these populations. A significant clinical benefit was found in terms of 
quality of life, communication, and reverberation related to the use of hearing 
aids. Access to hearing aids should be granted, and public health strategies are 
needed to grant the access to hearing rehabilitation in these populations.

immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) effectively reduce viral loads in 
patients. However, due to mutations, new therapy-resistant Env variants 
frequently emerge. The sites of mutations on Env that appear in each patient are 
considered random and unpredictable. Here we developed an algorithm to estimate 
for each patient the mutational state of each position based on the mutational 
state of adjacent positions on the three-dimensional structure of the protein.
METHODS: We developed a dynamic ensemble selection algorithm designated k-best 
classifiers. It identifies the best classifiers within the neighborhood of a new 
observation and applies them to predict the variability state of each 
observation. To evaluate the algorithm, we applied amino acid sequences of Envs 
from 300 HIV-1-infected individuals (at least six sequences per patient). For 
each patient, amino acid variability values at all Env positions were mapped 
onto the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Then, the variability state 
of each position was estimated by the variability at adjacent positions of the 
protein.
RESULTS: The proposed algorithm showed higher performance than the base learner 
and a panel of classification algorithms. The mutational state of positions in 
the high-mannose patch and CD4-binding site of Env, which are targeted by 
multiple therapeutics, was predicted well. Importantly, the algorithm 
outperformed other classification techniques for predicting the variability 
state at multi-position footprints of therapeutics on Env.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm applies a dynamic classifier-scoring 
approach that increases its performance relative to other classification 
methods. Better understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of variability 
across Env may lead to new treatment strategies that are tailored to the unique 
mutational patterns of each patient. More generally, we propose the algorithm as 
a new high-performance dynamic ensemble selection technique.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13015-023-00228-0

prevention. However, there is still limited evidence on the health benefits of 
peer support programs for lay peer leaders.
PURPOSE: To examine whether a peer support program designed for diabetes 
prevention resulted in greater improvements in health behaviors and outcomes for 
peer leaders as compared to other participants.
METHODS: 51 lay peer leaders and 437 participants from the Kerala Diabetes 
Prevention Program were included. Data were collected at baseline, 12 months, 
and 24 months. We compared behavioral, clinical, biochemical, and health-related 
quality of life parameters between peer leaders and their peers at the three 
time-points.
RESULTS: After 12 months, peer leaders showed significant improvements in 
leisure time physical activity (+ 17.7% vs. + 3.4%, P = 0.001) and 
health-related quality of life (0.0 vs. + 0.1, P = 0.004); and a significant 
reduction in alcohol use (-13.6% vs. -6.6%, P = 0.012) and 2-hour plasma glucose 
(-4.1 vs. + 9.9, P = 0.006), as compared to participants. After 24 months, 
relative to baseline, peer leaders had significant improvements in fruit and 
vegetable intake (+ 34.5% vs. + 26.5%, P = 0.017) and leisure time physical 
activity (+ 7.9% vs. -0.9%, P = 0.009); and a greater reduction in alcohol use 
(-13.6% vs. -4.9%, P = 0.008), and waist-to-hip ratio (-0.04 vs. -0.02, 
P = 0.014), as compared to participants. However, only the changes in fruit and 
vegetable intake and waist-to-hip ratio were maintained between 12 and 24 
months.
CONCLUSION: Being a peer leader in a diabetes prevention program was associated 
with greater health benefits during and after the intervention period. Further 
studies are needed to examine the long-term sustainability of these benefits.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-16049-0

canals. Overlooked root canals may cause endodontic failure. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the prevalence of root canals and the number of roots 
of premolars in a selected Turkish population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,570 teeth from 1,438 patients were 
evaluated. The cone-beam computed tomography scans of 1,055 maxillary and 1,515 
mandibular premolars were examined.
RESULTS: Type IV root canal morphology was observed most frequently in maxillary 
first premolars (77%), and the rates of single and double channel formations 
were very similar (51% and 49%, respectively). Of the second maxillary 
premolars, 57.4% had Type I morphology, and 89.9% of the teeth were 
single-rooted, while 68.6% had a single root canal. The most common formation 
was Type I (85%) among mandibular first premolars, and a single root was 
observed in 95.6% of these teeth. In addition, 87% of the mandibular first 
premolars had a single root canal. The second mandibular premolars mostly had 
Type I (95.4%) formation, and 99.3% of the teeth were single-rooted, while 96.9% 
had a single root canal.
CONCLUSION: According to our findings, 51% of maxillary first premolars had a 
single root, 79.4% had two root canals, and 77% had Type IV (77%) formation. 
Maxillary second premolars mostly had Type I formation. In addition, a single 
root and single root canal formation were most common. Mandibular first 
premolars generally had a single root and single root canal formation, but 13% 
had two root canals, and 6.4% had Type V formation. More than 95% of mandibular

The concern of increasing salinity concentration in freshwater bodies due to 
climate change may greatly impact the aquatic environment. Gills are one of the 
important osmoregulatory organs and have direct contact with external 
environment. Hence, the current study is conducted to understand the gill 
transcriptomic response of L. rohita under hypersalinity environment.
RESULTS: Comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs was performed in gills of L. rohita 
treated with 2, 4, 6 and 8ppt salinity concentrations. Networks of 
lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA revealed involvement of 20, 33, 52 and 61 differentially 
expressed lncRNAs, 11, 13, 26 and 21 differentially expressed miRNAs in 2, 4, 6 
and 8ppt groups between control and treatment respectively. These lncRNA-miRNA 
pairs were regulating 87, 214, 499 and 435 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE 
mRNAs) in 2, 4, 6 and 8ppt treatments respectively. Functional analysis of these 
genes showed enrichment in pathways related to ion transportation and osmolyte 
production to cope with induced osmotic pressure due to high salt concentration. 
Pathways related to signal transduction (MAPK, FOXO and phosphatidylinositol 
signaling), and environmental information processing were also upregulated under 
hypersalinity. Energy metabolism and innate immune response pathways also appear 
to be regulated. Protein turnover was high at 8ppt as evidenced by enrichment of 
the proteasome and aminoacyl tRNA synthesis pathways, along with other enriched 
KEGG terms such as apoptosis, cellular senescence and cell cycle.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, the RNA-seq analysis provided valuable insights into 
competitive endogenous (lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA) regulatory network of L. rohita under 
salinity stress. L. rohita is adapting to the salinity stress by means of 
upregulating protein turnover, osmolyte production and removing the damaged 
cells using apoptotic pathway and regulating the cell growth and hence diverting 
the essential energy for coping with salinity stress.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12864-023-09426-x

disease (AD) as some of the global persistent health challenges with no lasting 
solutions, despite of significant inputs of modern-day pharmaceutical firms. 
This study therefore, aimed to appraise the in vitro antioxidant potential, 
enzymes inhibitory activities, and as well carry out in silico study on 
bioactive compounds from polyphenolic-rich extract of Hibiscus cannabinus seed 
(PEHc).
METHODS: In vitro antioxidant assays were performed on PEHc using standard 
methods while the identification of phytoconstituents was carried out with high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For the in silico molecular docking 
using Schrodinger's Grid-based ligand docking with energetics software, seven 
target proteins were retrieved from the database ( https://www.rcsb.org/ ).
RESULTS: HPLC technique identified twelve chemical compounds in PEHc, while 
antioxidant quantification revealed higher total phenolic contents 
(243.5 ± 0.71 mg GAE/g) than total flavonoid contents (54.06 ± 0.09 mg QE/g) 
with a significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of ABTS (IC50 = 218.30 ± 0.87 µg/ml) 
and 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radicals (IC50 = 227.79 ± 0.74 µg/ml). 
In a similar manner, the extract demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) 
inhibitory activity against α-amylase (IC50 = 256.88 ± 6.15 µg/ml) and 
α-glucosidase (IC50 = 183.19 ± 0.23 µg/ml) as well as acetylcholinesterase 
(IC50 = 262.95 ± 1.47 µg/ml) and butyrylcholinesterase 
(IC50 = 189.97 ± 0.82 µg/ml), respectively. Furthermore, In silico study showed 
that hibiscetin (a lead) revealed a very strong binding affinity energies for 
DPP-4, (PDB ID: 1RWQ) and α-amylase (PDB ID: 1SMD), gamma-tocopherol ( for 
peptide-1 receptor; PDB ID: 3C59, AChE; PDB ID: 4EY7 and BChE; PDB ID: 7B04), 
cianidanol for α-glucosidase; PDB ID: 7KBJ and kaempferol for Poly [ADP-ribose] 
polymerase 1 (PARP-1); PDB ID: 6BHV, respectively. More so, ADMET scores 
revealed drug-like potentials of the lead compounds identified in PEHc.
CONCLUSION: As a result, the findings of this study point to potential drug-able 
compounds in PEHc that could be useful for the management of DM and AD.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12906-023-04023-7

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The sole presence of deep submucosal invasion is shown to be 
associated with a limited risk of lymph node metastasis. This justifies a local 
excision of suspected deep submucosal invasive colon carcinomas (T1 CCs) as a 
first step treatment strategy. Recently Colonoscopy-Assisted Laparoscopic Wedge 
Resection (CAL-WR) has been shown to be able to resect pT1 CRCs with a high R0 
resection rate, but the long term outcomes are lacking. The aim of this study is 
to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and long-term oncological outcomes of 
CAL-WR as primary treatment for patients with suspected superficial and also 
deeply-invasive T1 CCs.
METHODS: In this prospective multicenter clinical trial, patients with a 
macroscopic and/or histologically suspected T1 CCs will receive CAL-WR as 
primary treatment in order to prevent unnecessary major surgery for low-risk T1 
CCs. To make a CAL-WR technically feasible, the tumor may not include > 50% of 
the circumference and has to be localized at least 25 cm proximal from the anus. 
Also, there should be sufficient distance to the ileocecal valve to place a 
linear stapler. Before inclusion, all eligible patients will be assessed by an 
expert panel to confirm suspicion of T1 CC, estimate invasion depth and 
subsequent advise which local resection techniques are possible for removal of 
the lesion. The primary outcome of this study is the proportion of patients with 
pT1 CC that is curatively treated with CAL-WR only and in whom thus 
organ-preservation could be achieved. Secondary outcomes are 1) CAL-WR's 
technical success and R0 resection rate for T1 CC, 2) procedure-related 
morbidity and mortality, 3) 5-year overall and disease free survival, 4) 3-year 
metastasis free survival, 5) procedure-related costs and 6) impact on quality of 
life. A sample size of 143 patients was calculated.
DISCUSSION: CAL-WR is a full-thickness local resection technique that could also 
be effective in removing pT1 colon cancer. With the lack of current endoscopic 
local resection techniques for > 15 mm pT1 CCs with deep submucosal invasion, 
CAL-WR could fill the gap between endoscopy and major oncologic surgery. The 
present study is the first to provide insight in the long-term oncological 
outcomes of CAL-WR.

and/or delay the onset of these diseases through proper interventions. 
Therefore, it is a prerequisite to know the prevalence of prediabetes and 
prehypertension and the factors associated with these conditions but people from 
developing countries including Bangladesh often remain undiagnosed and unaware 
of these conditions. In this study we investigate the prevalence of prediabetes 
and prehypertension and their associated factors in Bangladesh using nationally 
representative data.
METHOD: We used nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and Health 
Survey (BDHS) 2017-18 survey data, which included a total sample of 14,704 
adults aged 18 years and more from whom blood pressure and fasting plasma 
glucose were collected. Chi-square test was used to examine the differences 
between sociodemographic and outcome variables. The univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with 
prediabetes and prehypertension.
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of prediabetes and prehypertension was 8.6% 
with 14% of the sampled population having from prediabetes and prehypertension 
separately. Among the prediabetic and prehypertensive participants, one-fourth 
of the participant were from the richest families and around one-third were 
overweight/obese, while more than fifty percent had normal Body Mass Index (BMI) 
and completed secondary and higher education. In the univariate analysis, the 
richest wealth status (UOR 3.3, 95% CI: 2.46 -4.35) and overweight/obesity (UOR 
3.2, 95% CI: 2.62-3.85) are the highest predictors for prediabetes and 
prehypertension. After adjusting the other variables, overweight/obesity remains 
the largest predictor for prediabetes and prehypertension (AOR:2.5, 95% 
CI:2.05-3.05). Further, people aged 31 and above and from the richest family had 
around 2 times and 1.8 times higher risk of being prediabetic and 
prehypertensive compared to the younger age people (18-30 years) and the poorest 
family (respectively).
CONCLUSION: The coexistence of prediabetes and prehypertension is an early sign 
of a greater burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the near future for 
Bangladesh. To reduce the higher burden of NCDs, our findings call for a 
multisectoral approach to identify the precondition of NCDs with particular 
attention to maintaining body weight.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-16090-z

populations. The interactions between phages and their hosts are complex and may 
vary in response to host physiology and environmental conditions. Here, we have 
selected the genomes of some representative Bacillus prophages and lysosomes 
from the NCBI database for evolutionary analysis. We explored their evolutionary 
relationships and analyzed the protein information encoded by hundreds of 
Bacillus phages.
RESULTS: We obtained the following conclusions: First, Bacillus phages carried 
some known functional gene fragments and a large number of unknown functional 
gene fragments, which might have an important impact on Bacillus populations, 
such as the formation of spores and biofilms and the transmission of virulence 
factors. Secondly, the Bacillus phage genome showed diversity, with a clear 
genome boundary between Bacillus prophages and Bacillus lytic phages. 
Furthermore, genetic mutations, sequence losses, duplications, and 
host-switching have occurred during the evolution of the Bacillus phage, 
resulting in low genome similarity between the Bacillus phages. Finally, the 
lysis module played an important influence on the process of Bacillus phage 
cross-species infestation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically described their protein function, 
diversity, and genome evolution, and the results of this study provide a basis 
for evolutionary diversity, horizontal gene transfer and co-evolution with the 
host in Bacillus phages.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12866-023-02907-9

oxidative stress levels; however, it is still unclear whether PCOS itself is 
causally related to oxidative stress (OS), whether OS can increase the 
occurrence of PCOS, and which characteristics of PCOS increase OS levels. 
Therefore, this study explored the causal relationship between PCOS, its 
characteristics, and OS.
METHODS: Two-sample bidirectional and two-sample Mendelian randomisation studies 
were performed based on publicly available statistics from genome-wide 
association studies. PCOS; its characteristics, such as testosterone, 
low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein; and 11 major OS markers 
(superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, 
catalase, uric acid, zinc, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, retinol, albumin, and 
total bilirubin), were studied. The main analytical method used was inverse 
variance weighting (IVW). Pleiotropy was evaluated using the Mendelian 
randomisation-Egger intercept. Q and P values were used to assess heterogeneity.
RESULTS: There was no causal relationship between PCOS and the OS indices (all 
P > 0.05). There was a causal relationship between the OS index, ascorbate 
level, and PCOS (IVW, odds ratio: 2.112, 95% confidence interval: 1.257-3.549, 
P = 0.005). In addition, there was a causal relationship between testosterone, 
low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, sex hormone-binding globulin, 
body mass index, triacylglycerol, age at menarche, and most OS indices according 
to the IVW method. The F statistics showed that there was no weak instrumental 
variable. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the leave-one-out method. 
No pleiotropy was observed. The results were robust, and the conclusions were 
reliable.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed for the first time that there was no causal 
relationship between PCOS and OS. However, there was a causal relationship 
between the OS index, ascorbate level, and PCOS. It revealed that PCOS itself 
could not increase OS, and the increase in OS in PCOS was related to other 
potential factors, such as testosterone, low-density lipoprotein, high-density 
lipoprotein, sex hormone-binding globulin, body mass index, triacylglycerol, and 
age at menarche.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12920-023-01581-0

patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) due to COVID-19, but the 
evidence is mostly from observational studies and low-quality randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), with conflicting results from published studies. A 
systematic review of published high-quality RCTs to resolve the controversy over 
the efficacy and safety of awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients 
with AHRF due to COVID-19.
METHODS: Candidate studies were identified through searches of PubMed, Web of 
Science, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus databases from December 1, 2019 to November 1, 
2022. Literature screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were 
independently conducted by two researchers.
RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 2657 patients were included. Meta-analysis of 
fixed effects models showed that awake prone positioning did not increase 
mortality(OR = 0.88, 95%CI [0.72, 1.08]), length of stay in ICU (WMD = 1.14, 
95%CI [-0.45, 2.72]), total length of stay (WMD = 0.11, 95%CI [-1.02, 1.23]), or 
incidence of adverse events (OR = 1.02, 95%CI [0.79, 1.31]) compared with usual 
care, but significantly reduced the intubation rate (OR = 0.72, 95%CI [0.60, 
0.86]). Similar results were found in a subgroup analysis of patients who 
received only high flow nasal cannula (Mortality: OR = 0.86, 95%CI [0.70, 1.05]; 
Intubation rate: OR = 0.69, 95%CI [0.58, 0.83]). All eight RCTs had high quality 
of evidence, which ensured the reliability of the meta-analysis results.
CONCLUSIONS: Awake prone positioning is safe and feasible in non-intubated 
patients with AHRF caused by COVID-19, and can significantly reduce the 
intubation rate. More studies are needed to explore standardized implementation 
strategies for the awake prone positioning.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Insects rely on chemosensory perception, mainly olfaction, for the 
location of mates, food sources, and oviposition sites. Plant-released volatile 
compounds guide herbivorous insects to search for and locate their host plants, 
further helping them to identify suitable positions for oviposition. The fall 
armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (S. frugiperda) was found to invade China in 2019 
and has since seriously threatened multiple crops, particularly maize and rice. 
However, the chemical and molecular mechanisms underlying oviposition preference 
in this pest are not fully understood. Here, the oviposition preference of S. 
frugiperda on maize and rice plants was investigated.
RESULTS: GC-EAD and GC-MS/MS techniques were used to identify the antennally 
active volatiles from maize and rice plants. The attraction and oviposition 
stimulation of identified components to female adults were tested in both 
laboratory and field settings. The odorant receptors (ORs) on female antennae 
were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their functions evaluated by RNAi. Ten 
and eleven compounds of maize and rice plants, respectively, were identified to 
possess electrophysiological activity from headspace volatiles. Among these 
compounds, (Z)-3-hexenyl-acetate specifically presented in maize volatiles was 
found to play a critical role in attracting females and stimulating oviposition 
compared to rice volatiles. Among the cloned ORs on the antennae of both sexes, 
SfruOR23 with highly female-biased expression mediated the responses of females 
to (Z)-3-hexenyl-acetate. Knockdown of SfruOR23 using RNAi markedly reduced the 
electrophysiological response of female antennae and oviposition preference to 
the compound.
CONCLUSIONS: (Z)-3-Hexenyl-acetate is a key volatile mediating the host and 
oviposition preference of S. frugiperda on maize. The olfactory receptor of 
(Z)-3-hexenyl-acetate was identified to be SfruOR23, which is mainly expressed 
in the antennae of S. frugiperda.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12915-023-01642-x

that nursing students should develop, and it plays a vital role in career 
development. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate factors related to 
problem-solving ability and the path relationships among those factors in the 
context of nursing students.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the factors that affect problem-solving 
ability, and to investigate path relationships of self-directed learning 
ability, critical thinking ability, learning engagement, and problem-solving 
ability among nursing students.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
SETTINGS: The Department of Nursing at a university located in Shanghai, China.
SAMPLE: A total of 540 nursing students with a three-year education program were 
enrolled in the current study.
METHODS: Data were collected by using a structured questionnaire, including 
general information, learning engagement, self-directed learning ability, 
critical thinking ability, and problem-solving ability of nursing students. 
Pearson's correlations were used to explore the relationships between learning 
engagement, self-directed learning ability, critical thinking ability, and 
problem-solving ability. The path relationships were analyzed by constructing a 
structural equation model using AMOS software.
RESULTS: Our results showed that learning engagement, self-directed learning 
ability, and critical thinking ability were positively associated with 
problem-solving ability. Furthermore, learning engagement did not influence 
problem-solving ability directly, but it affected problem-solving ability 
indirectly via self-directed learning ability and critical thinking ability 
among nursing students. Additionally, the total effects of self-directed 
learning (0.442) and critical thinking ability (0.581) were more prominent than 
learning engagement (0.361) on problem-solving ability.
CONCLUSIONS: To improve the problem-solving ability of nursing students, nursing 
educators should develop targeted strategies to enhance learning engagement, 
self-directed learning ability, and critical thinking ability.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12912-023-01280-2

physical activity and sedentary behavior have examined children or adolescents, 
employed cross-sectional or longitudinal designs that do not extend from 
childhood into adulthood, and utilized self- or parent-reported data on physical 
activity and sedentary behavior. This longitudinal study investigated whether 
socioemotional behavior in childhood and temperament in middle adulthood predict 
accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior in late 
adulthood.
METHODS: This study was based on the Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Personality 
and Social Development (JYLS). Socioemotional behavior (behavioral activity, 
well-controlled behavior, negative emotionality) was assessed at age 8 based on 
teacher ratings, whereas temperament (surgency, effortful control, negative 
affectivity, orienting sensitivity) was assessed at age 42 based on self-rating. 
Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed at 
age 61 using an accelerometer. Data (N = 142) were analyzed using linear 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: In women, behavioral activity at age 8 predicted higher levels of daily 
sedentary behavior at age 61. The association did not remain statistically 
significant after controlling for participant's occupational status. In 
addition, women's negative affectivity at age 42 predicted lower daily 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at age 61, particularly during leisure 
time. No statistically significant results were observed in men.
CONCLUSIONS: Although few weak associations of socioemotional behavior and 
temperament with physical activity and sedentary behavior were detected in 
women, they were observed over several decades, and thus, deserve attention in 
future studies. In addition to other factors contributing to physical activity 
and sedentary behavior, health professionals may be sensitive to individual 
characteristics, such as a tendency to experience more negative emotions, when 
doing health counseling or planning for health-promoting interventions targeting 
physical activity and sedentary behavior.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-16110-y

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Articular injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been 
applied to treat knee osteoarthritis (kOA), but its clinical outcomes are 
controversial. This study investigated whether an articular inflammatory 
microenvironment (AIM) impacts MSC-based therapy in a rat model of kOA.
METHODS: The biological change of MSCs and the functional change of MSCs on 
chondrocytes were evaluated under AIM. The key mediator and mechanism for the 
AIM impact on MSC therapy were explored via gain- and loss-of-function 
approaches.
RESULTS: The results showed that MSCs exerted potent anti-kOA effects in vivo 
and in vitro, but that this therapy become chondrodestructive if a chronic AIM 
was present. Mechanistically, the overexpression of MMP13 in the injected MSCs 
via a MAPKs-AP1 signaling axis was revealed as the underlying mechanism for the 
detriment outcome.

mortality. The Chinese Visceral Adiposity Index (CVAI) serves as an established 
metric for assessing visceral adiposity in the Chinese population, exhibiting 
prognostic capabilities. This investigation aimed to explore the association of 
CVAI and new-onset stroke among middle-aged and older Chinese populations.
METHODS: The study employed data from the 2011 and 2018 China Health and 
Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) to assess the association of CVAI and the 
incidence of new-onset stroke. Utilizing a directed acyclic graph (DAG), 10 
potential confounders were identified. Moreover, to explore the association 
between CVAI and new-onset stroke, three multifactor logistic regression models 
were constructed, accounting for the identified confounders and mitigating their 
influence on the findings.
RESULTS: The study comprised 7070 participants, among whom 417 (5.9%) 
experienced new-onset strokes. After controlling for confounding variables, 
regression analysis suggested that the new-onset stroke's highest risk was 
linked to the fourth quartile (Q4) of the CVAI, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.33 
and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.67-3.28. The decision tree analysis 
demonstrated a heightened probability of new-onset stroke among hypertensive 
individuals with a CVAI equal to or greater than 83, coupled with a C-reactive 
protein level no less than 1.1 mg/l. Age seemed to have a moderating influence 
on the CVAI and new-onset stroke association, exhibiting a more prominent 
interaction effect in participants under 60 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged and older Chinese populations, a linear relationship 
was discerned between CVAI and the probability of new-onset stroke. CVAI 
provides a predictive framework for stroke incidence in this demographic, laying 
the groundwork for more sophisticated risk prediction models that improve the 
precision and specificity of stroke risk evaluations.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12944-023-01843-x

living (ADL) disability and depressive symptoms in older people. However, 
discussions on the direction of this relationship are insufficient. The study's 
objective was to assess the reciprocal relationship between ADL disability and 
depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older Chinese people.
METHOD: Data was collected in four waves of a nationwide survey, the China 
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which was carried out in 
2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018. In total, this study included 4,124 participants 
aged ≥ 45 years at baseline. A summing score of the eleven items for basic 
activities of daily living (BADL) and instrumental activities of daily living 
(IADL) was calculated to indicate the degree of ADL disability. The 10-item 
Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) was adopted to 
measure depressive symptoms. The reciprocal relationship between ADL disability 
and depressive symptoms was tested by cross-lagged models.
RESULT: At baseline, 911 (22.1%) participants were classified as having 
difficulties with ADL, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 34.4% 
(1,418). Among middle-aged and older people in China, there was a significant 
reciprocal and longitudinal relationship between ADL disability and depressive 
symptoms. People who had difficulty with ADL faced a higher risk of depressive 
symptoms, and those who suffered from depressive symptoms were accompanied by an 
increase in ADL disability in the following years. The subgroup analysis on age 
also showed that ADL disability was reciprocally and longitudinally related to 
depressive symptoms. However, only women showed similar results in the subgroup 
analysis on gender.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that ADL disability is bi-directionally related to 
depressive symptoms in middle-aged and older Chinese people over time. The 
results suggest we should identify ADL disability and bad psychological 
conditions in time to prevent subsequent mutual damage among middle-aged and 
older Chinese people, a vulnerable group rising in the future.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-16100-0

involved in cytokine receptor-mediated intracellular signal transduction through 
the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. JAK3 was previously shown as differentially 
expressed in granulosa cells (GC) of bovine pre-ovulatory follicles suggesting 
that JAK3 could modulate GC function and activation/inhibition of downstream 
targets. We used JANEX-1, a JAK3 inhibitor, and FSH treatments and analyzed 
proliferation markers, steroidogenic enzymes and phosphorylation of target 
proteins including STAT3, CDKN1B/p27Kip1 and MAPK8IP3/JIP3. Cultured GC were 
treated with or without FSH in the presence or not of JANEX-1. Expression of 
steroidogenic enzyme CYP11A1, but not CYP19A1, was upregulated in GC treated 
with FSH and both were significantly decreased when JAK3 was inhibited. 
Proliferation markers CCND2 and PCNA were reduced in JANEX-1-treated GC and 
upregulated by FSH. Western blots analyses showed that JANEX-1 treatment reduced 
pSTAT3 amounts while JAK3 overexpression increased pSTAT3. Similarly, FSH 
treatment increased pSTAT3 even in JANEX-1-treated GC. UHPLC-MS/MS analyses 
revealed phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues within JAK3 as well as 
CDKN1B and MAPK8IP3 suggesting possible activation or inhibition post-FSH or 
JANEX-1 treatments. We show that FSH activates JAK3 in GC, which could 
phosphorylate target proteins and likely modulate other signaling pathways

Candida albicans, and Aspergillus flavus while the antioxidant activity was 
screened with the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging 
assay. The sun protection factor was determined using a Shimadzu Ultra 
Violet-visible (UV-VIS) double beam spectrophotometer between 290 to 320 nm.
RESULTS: Eleven compounds; quercetin (1), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (2), rutin 
(3, 12), myo-inositol (4), asperulosidic acid (5), hexadecanoic acid (6), 
β-sitosterol (7), stigmasterol (8), campesterol (9), ursolic acid (10), and 
β-sitosterol glucoside (11) were identified in the S. princeae extracts. 
Compound 2 had good antifungal activity against C. albicans (zone of inhibition, 
23.0 ± 0.1 mm). Compound 10 showed antibacterial and antifungal activity against 
S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, and A. flavus. Compound 2 had a good 
percentage radical scavenging effect (IC50 = 64.81 µg/ml) and a good sun 
protection factor (SPF = 26.83).
CONCLUSION: This study reports the first-time isolation and identification of 
compounds 1 to 11 from S. princeae, which contribute to its antimicrobial, 
antioxidant, and sun protection potential.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12906-023-04026-4

Coccinellidae), native to Asia, has been introduced to other major continents 
where it has caused serious negative impacts on local biodiversity. Though 
notable advances to understand its invasion success have been made during the 
past decade, especially with then newer molecular tools, the conclusions reached 
remain to be confirmed with more advanced genomic analyses and especially using 
more samples from larger geographical regions across the native range. 
Furthermore, although H. axyridis is one of the best studied invasive insect 
species with respect to life history traits (often comparing invasive and native 
populations), the traits responsible for its colonization success in non-native 
areas warrant more research.
RESULTS: Our analyses of genome-wide nuclear population structure indicated that 
an eastern Chinese population could be the source of all non-native populations 
and revealed several putatively adaptive candidate genomic loci involved in body 
color variation, visual perception, and hemolymph synthesis. Our estimates of 
evolutionary history indicate (1) asymmetric migration with varying population 
sizes across its native and non-native range, (2) a recent admixture between 
eastern Chinese and American populations in Europe, (3) signatures of a large 
progressive, historical bottleneck in the common ancestors of both populations 
and smaller effective sizes of the non-native population, and (4) the southwest 
origin and subsequent dispersal routes within its native range in China. In 
addition, we found that while two mitochondrial haplotypes-Hap1 and Hap2 were 
dominant in the native range, Hap1 was the only dominant haplotype in the 
non-native range. Our laboratory observations in both China and USA found 
statistical yet slight differences between Hap1 and Hap2 in some of life history 
traits.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study on H. axyridis provides new insights into its invasion 
processes into other major continents from its native Asian range, reconstructs 
a geographic range evolution across its native region China, and tentatively 
suggests that its invasiveness may differ between mitochondrial haplotypes.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12915-023-01638-7

immunophenotypic characteristics and differential diagnosis of primary breast 
carcinomas with signet ring cell differentiation, as well as differences in the 
traits of signet ring-like cell mucin.
METHODS: A total of five cases of primary breast cancer diagnosed with signet 
ring cell differentiation and treated at The First People's Hospital of Jingmen 
from January 2016 to December 2021 were collected. HE, immunohistochemical 
staining, and AB-PAS staining were used for the analysis.
RESULTS: Although we strictly selected all the primary breast cancer cases with 
signet ring cell differentiation, there were differences in the arrangement of 
the cells and the grading of nuclei. Our immunohistochemical results showed that 
the ER was consistently strongly positive, and the PR expression was not 
consistent, while all the cases of HER2 were negative. CK7 was negative in one 
case, and CK20 and CK5/6 were not expressed in all the cases. The mucin MUC1 was 
positive and showed two patterns. MUC2 was strongly positive in all the cases. 
All the cases were negative for CDX2, SATB2, PAX8, TTF-1, and Napsin A, while 
the positive expression of COX2, Villin, and WT-1 was not constant. One case 
expressed neuroendocrine markers. The expression level of Ki67 was between 10 
and 30%. AB (pH 2.5)-PAS staining revealed that the intracellular mucus 
contained more cells with neutral mucus, while the extracellular mucus was 
mainly acidic.
CONCLUSION: We found that histological morphology, cell morphology, and nuclear 
grading differentiate among different cases. The immunohistochemical 
characteristics of primary breast cancers diagnosed with signet ring cell 
differentiation are helpful for identification. The differences in the 
expression patterns of mucins may be related to unfavorable clinicopathological 
factors, but their usefulness as a prognostic marker remains to be further 
understood. The heterogeneity of cell mucus, the differentiation of tumor cells, 
and the phenotypic changes of tumors also need further study.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12957-023-03074-x

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Gonorrhea and chlamydia are the most common sexually transmitted 
diseases (STDs) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. Previous studies 
have shown pay-it-forward (PIF) interventions to be associated with a 
substantial increase in gonorrhea and chlamydia test uptake compared to 
standard-of-care. We propose a 'pay-it-forward' gonorrhea and chlamydia testing 
randomized controlled trial (PIONEER). The trial would evaluate the 
effectiveness of two pay-it-forward strategies in promoting testing uptake 
compared to the standard of care (in which men pay for their tests 
out-of-pocket) among MSM and male STD patients in China.
METHODS: PIONEER will be a three-armed, pragmatic cluster randomized controlled 
trial (RCT), conducted across 12 clinics (six MSM-led and six public STD 
clinics) to compare the effectiveness of three implementation strategies. Each 
facility will be randomized to a standard pay-it-forward intervention of 
gonorrhea/ chlamydia testing with minimal encouragement for testing, a 
community-engaged pay-it-forward arm, or a control arm where men pay for their 
tests out-of-pockets. The primary outcome will be dual gonorrhea/chlamydia test 
uptake. Secondary outcomes will include syphilis testing, amount donated in 
pay-it-forward, number of positive gonorrhea and chlamydia tests, and measures 
of antimicrobial resistance. A sequential transformative mixed methods design 
will be used to evaluate the implementation process in type 2 
effectiveness-implementation hybrid design. Data sources will include survey on 
acceptability, and feelings and attitudes towards the interventions among 
participants; testing and treatment uptake data from clinic records, WeChat 
records, and qualitative data to gain insights into men's perceptions and 
attitudes towards the pay-it-forward, mechanisms driving uptake, and donating 
behaviors. Implementers and organizers will be interviewed about fidelity and 
adherence to protocol, sustainability of pay-it-forward intervention, and 
barriers and facilitators of implementing the intervention.
DISCUSSION: PIONEER will substantially increase gonorrhea/chlamydia testing 
among MSM in China, providing an innovative and new financial mechanism to 
sustain STD screening among sexual minorities in low- and middle-income 
countries. This study will answer compelling scientific questions about how best 
to implement pay-it-forward and the individual and organizational 
characteristics that moderate it.

(HPV) vaccine uptake has been on effective strategies that physicians use to 
promote vaccination. However, in large, predominately rural states like Montana, 
nurses and medical assistants play critical roles in immunization services 
delivery, and their viewpoints are imperative in designing strategies to 
increase vaccination rates. We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive study to 
determine nurses' perceptions, experiences, and practices regarding human 
papillomavirus vaccination in a rural and medically underserved region of the 
United States.
METHODS: We designed, pilot-tested, and disseminated an online survey instrument 
to nurses and medical assistants working in clinics participating in the 
Vaccines for Children program in Montana. The online surveys were administered 
from November 2020 to March 2021. Survey questions focused on clinic vaccination 
practices, respondents' perceptions of the HPV vaccine, perceived barriers to 
vaccine uptake, and general opinions on potential strategies to improve HPV 
vaccination rates.
RESULTS: We analyzed data from 227 respondents. Overall, 90% of nurses strongly 
agreed or agreed that the HPV vaccine is important and had confidence in the 
vaccine's safety. More nurses reported experiencing greater parental vaccine 
refusal or delay for male patients regardless of age. About 53.7% of nurses 
reported that their clinics had reminder/recall systems to encourage parents to 
bring their children for vaccination. Nurses identified misinformation from 
social media, infrequent wellness visits, and vaccine safety concerns as 
barriers to HPV vaccine uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: Study findings identified several promising initiatives to 
accelerate vaccination in primarily rural states like Montana, including 
promoting widespread adoption of reminder/recall systems, training nurses in 
evidence-based techniques to provide strong vaccine recommendations, and 
leveraging social media to disseminate consistent messages about the HPV vaccine 
recommendations for both sexes and its role in cancer prevention.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12912-023-01379-6

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The global burden of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has shown an 
upsurge in recent years due to the higher load of immunocompromised patients 
suffering from various diseases. The role of early and accurate diagnosis in the 
aggressive containment of the fungal infection at the initial stages becomes 
crucial thus, preventing the development of a life-threatening situation. With 
the changing demands of clinical mycology, the field of fungal diagnostics has 
evolved and come a long way from traditional methods of microscopy and culturing 
to more advanced non-culture-based tools. With the advent of more powerful 
approaches such as novel PCR assays, T2 Candida, microfluidic chip technology, 
next generation sequencing, new generation biosensors, nanotechnology-based 
tools, artificial intelligence-based models, the face of fungal diagnostics is 
constantly changing for the better. All these advances have been reviewed here 
giving the latest update to our readers in the most orderly flow.
MAIN TEXT: A detailed literature survey was conducted by the team followed by 
data collection, pertinent data extraction, in-depth analysis, and composing the 
various sub-sections and the final review. The review is unique in its kind as 
it discusses the advances in molecular methods; advances in serology-based 
methods; advances in biosensor technology; and advances in machine 
learning-based models, all under one roof. To the best of our knowledge, there 
has been no review covering all of these fields (especially biosensor technology 
and machine learning using artificial intelligence) with relevance to invasive 
fungal infections.
CONCLUSION: The review will undoubtedly assist in updating the scientific 
community's understanding of the most recent advancements that are on the 
horizon and that may be implemented as adjuncts to the traditional diagnostic 
algorithms.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12929-023-00926-2

risk. However, both reason for non-employment and the duration affects the 
relationship. These factors are investigated to a lesser extent. About one third 
of the Norwegian working age population are not currently employed. Due to the 
share size of this population even a small increase in suicide risk is of 
importance, and hence increased knowledge about this group is needed.
METHODS: We used discrete time event history analysis to examine the 
relationship between suicide risk and non-employment due to either unemployment 
or health-problems, and the duration of these non-employment periods. We analyze 
data from the Norwegian population registry from 2004 to 2014, which includes 
all Norwegian residents in the ages 19-58 born between 1952 and 1989. In total 
the data consists of 1 063 052 men and 1 024 238 women, and 2 039 suicides.
RESULTS: The suicide risk among the non-employed men and women is significantly 
higher than that of the employed. For the unemployed men, the suicide risk is 
significantly higher than the employed within the first 18 months. For the 
unemployed women we only find a significant association with suicide risk among 
those unemployed for six to twelve months. The suicide risk is especially 
increased among those with temporary health-related benefits. In the second year 
of health-related non-employment men have eightfold and women over twelvefold 
the OR for suicide, compared to the employed.
CONCLUSION: There is an association between non-employment and suicide risk. 
Compared to the employed both unemployed men and men and women with 
health-related non-employment have elevated suicide risk, and the duration of 
non-employment may be the driving force. Considering the large share of the 
working age population that are not employed, non-employment status should be 
considered in suicide risk assessment by health care professionals and welfare 
providers.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-16084-x

experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) have been found to be both 
clinically and cost effective. Following the publication of a new EIP model of 
care (MoC) in Ireland, the aim of this research is to describe how people 
participated in and responded to the MoC including service users, family 
members, HSE clinical staff and HSE management.
METHODS: Qualitative design using the UK Medical Research Council's process 
evaluation framework. Purposive sampling techniques were used. A total of N = 40 
key informant semi-structured interviews were completed which included clinical 
staff (N = 22), health service managers and administrators (N = 9), service 
users (N = 8) and a family member (N = 1). Thematic analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Unique features of the EIP service (e.g., speed of referral/assessment, 
multidisciplinary approach, a range of evidence-based interventions and 
assertive MDT follow up) and enthusiasm for EIP were identified as two key 
factors that facilitated implementation. In contrast, obstacles to staff 
recruitment and budget challenges emerged as two primary barriers to 
implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this research provide real world insights into 
the complexity of implementing an innovative service within an existing health 
system. Clear and committed financial and human resource processes which allow 
new innovations to thrive and be protected during their initiation and early 
implementation phase are paramount. These elements should be considered in the

OBJECTIVES: To perform effectiveness and economic analyses using data from a 
retrospective study of patients who underwent XLIF surgery using tricalcium 
phosphate combined with iliac bone graft (TCP + IBG) or BMP-2 in Thailand.
METHODS: Data were collected from retrospective review of the medical charts and 
the spine registry of Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The patients were 
divided into two groups (TCP + IBG group and BMP-2 group). Demographic, 
perioperative data, radiographic, clinical results, and quality of life related 
to health were collected and analyzed at 2-year follow-up. All economic data 
were collected during the perioperative period and presented as total charge, 
bone graft, implant/instrumentation, operative service, surgical supply, 
transfusion, medication, anesthesia, laboratory, and physical therapy.
RESULTS: Twenty-five TCP + IBG and 30 BMP-2 patients with spondylolisthesis and 
spinal stenosis as primary diagnosis were included. There were no significant 
differences in all demographic parameters (gender, age, underlying disease, 
diagnosis, and level of spine) between these two groups. During the 
perioperative period, the TCP + IBG group had more mean blood loss and more 
postoperative complications compared to the BMP-2 group. At 2 years of 
follow-up, there were no significant differences between the radiographic and 
clinical outcomes of the TCP + IBG and BMP-2 groups. The fusion rate for 
TCP + IBG and BMP-2 at 2 years of follow-up was 80% and 96.7%, respectively, and 
no statistically significant differences were observed. All clinical outcomes 
(Utility, Oswestry Disability Index, and EuroQol Visual Analog Scale) at 2-year 
follow-up improved significantly compared to preoperative outcomes, but there 
were no significant differences between the TCP + IBG and BMP-2 groups, either 
at preoperatively or at 2-year follow-up. The total charge of TCP + IBG was 
statistically significantly lower than that of BMP-2. Furthermore, the charges 
of TCP + IBG and BMP-2 during the perioperative period in Thailand were up to 
three times less than those in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: Using TCP + IBG as a standalone bone substitution for XLIF surgery 
with additional posterior instrumentation resulted in significantly lower direct 
medical charge compared to those using BMP-2 in the perioperative period. 
However, we could not detect a difference in the long-term radiographic and 
clinical outcomes of patients with TCP + IBG and BMP-2. These suggest that 
TCP + IBG may be a valuable alterative bone graft, especially in low- and 
middle-income countries.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12891-023-06590-9

opportunities for modeling large, complex modern data generated in medicine. 
Unfortunately, when it comes to understanding why machine learning models are 
predictive, applied research continues to rely on 'out of bag' (OOB) variable 
importance metrics (VIMPs) that are known to have considerable shortcomings 
within the statistics community. After explaining the limitations of OOB VIMPs - 
including bias towards correlated features and limited interpretability - we 
describe a modern approach called 'knockoff VIMPs' and explain its advantages.
METHODS: We first evaluate current VIMP practices through an in-depth literature 
review of 50 recent random forest manuscripts. Next, we recommend organized and 
interpretable strategies for analysis with knockoff VIMPs, including computing 
them for groups of features and considering multiple model performance metrics. 
To demonstrate methods, we develop a random forest to predict 5-year incident 
stroke in the Sleep Heart Health Study and compare results based on OOB and 
knockoff VIMPs.
RESULTS: Nearly all papers in the literature review contained substantial 
limitations in their use of VIMPs. In our demonstration, using OOB VIMPs for 
individual variables suggested two highly correlated lung function variables 
(forced expiratory volume, forced vital capacity) as the best predictors of 
incident stroke, followed by age and height. Using an organized analytic 
approach that considered knockoff VIMPs of both groups of features and 
individual features, the largest contributions to model sensitivity were 
medications (especially cardiovascular) and measured medical risk factors, while 
the largest contributions to model specificity were age, diastolic blood 
pressure, self-reported medical risk factors, polysomnography features, and 
pack-years of smoking. Thus, we reach very different conclusions about stroke 
risk factors using OOB VIMPs versus knockoff VIMPs.
CONCLUSIONS: The near-ubiquitous reliance on OOB VIMPs may provide misleading 
results for researchers who use such methods to guide their research. Given the 
rapid pace of scientific inquiry using machine learning, it is essential to 
bring modern knockoff VIMPs that are interpretable and unbiased into widespread 
applied practice to steer researchers using random forest machine learning 
toward more meaningful results.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12874-023-01965-x

non-invasive vascular access assessment method by clinicians from multiple 
disciplines worldwide, prior and during vascular access cannulations. While 
POCUS is a relatively new method to establish a vascular access in patients with 
complex vascular conditions, it is also essential to train and educate 
individuals who are novices in the techniques of cannulation so that they become 
proficient in performing this task subsequently on patients safely and 
successfully. A simulated environment may be a helpful tool to help healthcare 
providers establish skills in using POCUS safely and may also help them to 
successfully establish vascular access in patients. With this project, we sought 
to determine if participants of a simulated POCUS workshop for vascular access 
can use this technique successfully in their individual clinical environment 
after their attendance of a half-day workshop.
METHODS: A mixed-methods longitudinal study design was chosen to evaluate a 
point-of-care ultrasound workshop for peripheral intravenous cannula insertion. 
The workshops used simulation models for cannulation in combination with 
multiple ultrasound devices from various manufacturers to expose participants to 
a broader variety of POCUS devices as they may also vary in different clinical 
areas. Participants self-assessed their cannulation skills using questionnaires 
on a 10-point rating scale prior to and directly after the workshop.
RESULTS: A total of 85 Individuals participated in eleven half-day workshops 
through 2021 and 2022. Workshop participants claimed that attending the workshop 
had significantly enhanced their clinical skill of using ultrasound for the 
purpose of cannulating a venous vessel. The level of confidence in using this 
technique had increased in all participants directly after conclusion of the 
workshop.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, clinicians are increasingly using POCUS to establish 
vascular access in patients, and it is necessary that they receive sufficient 
and adequately structured and formal training to successfully apply this 
technique in their clinical practice. Offering a workshop which uses simulation 
models in combination with various POCUS devices to demonstrate this technique 
in a hands-on approach has proven to be useful to establish this newly learned 
skill in clinicians.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12909-023-04428-5

better outcomes. The more information patients have about their illness, the 
less likely they are to be readmitted to the hospital. Such knowledge includes 
the cause, symptoms, probable duration, and expected evolution of the clinical 
picture. In Portugal, a tool for testing patient knowledge is an unmet need. 
Therefore, this study aimed to adapt and test the Chronic Heart Failure 
Knowledge Questionnaire (KQCHF) for the Portuguese context.
METHODS: This work includes three cross-sectional studies. In Study 1, subjects 
were divided between before and after receiving information about HF. In Study 
2, participants answered the questionnaire before and after reading the 
brochure. In Study 3, KQCHF was applied to patients with HF. Studies 1 and 2 
were carried out in the general population. Study 3 was carried out with HF 
outpatients. Convenience sampling was applied to participants in the three 
studies.
RESULTS: In Study 1 (n = 45), those who received information had better scores 
(9.2 ± 1.9) than those who did not (6.0 ± 2.3). In Study 2 (n = 21), the scores 
were higher after reading the brochure (10.4 ± 1.7 vs. 6.5 ± 2.9). In Study 3 
(n = 169), women had better scores than men (9.1 ± 2.1 vs. 8.3 ± 2.2, overall: 
8.5 ± 2.2), and knowledge was correlated with education (r = .340, p < .001) and 
age (r = -.170, p = .030).
CONCLUSION: The Portuguese adaptation of KQCHF captured relevant knowledge about 
HF and has shown promising results for clinical and research purposes. The 
questionnaire can be useful in assessing HF patients' knowledge of their disease 
and as a basis for the implementation of general and personalised educational 
strategies to improve HF knowledge and, therefore, promote health literacy and 
self-care.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12872-023-03325-5

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer (OV) has a high mortality rate all over the world, and 
extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays a key role in carcinogenesis. We 
wish to study more about the molecular structure of eccDNA in the UACC-1598-4 
cell line and how its genes are associated with ovarian cancer prognosis.
METHODS: We sequenced and annotated the eccDNA by Circle_seq of the OV cell line 
UACC-1598-4. To acquire the amplified genes of OV on eccDNA, the annotated 
eccDNA genes were intersected with the overexpression genes of OV in TCGA. 
Univariate Cox regression was used to find the genes on eccDNA that were linked 
to OV prognosis. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and 
cox regression models were used to create the OV prognostic model, as well as 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve and nomogram of the 
prediction model. By applying the median value of the risk score, the samples 
were separated into high-risk and low-risk groups, and the differences in immune 
infiltration between the two groups were examined using ssGSEA.
RESULTS: EccDNA in UACC-1598-4 has a length of 0-2000 bp, and some of them 
include the whole genes or gene fragments. These eccDNA originated from various 
parts of chromosomes, especially enriched in repeatmasker, introns, and coding 
regions. They were annotated with 2188 genes by Circle_seq. Notably, the TCGA 
database revealed that a total of 198 of these eccDNA genes were overexpressed 
in OV (p < 0.05). They were mostly enriched in pathways associated with cell 
adhesion, ECM receptors, and actin cytoskeleton. Univariate Cox analysis showed 
13 genes associated with OV prognosis. LASSO and Cox regression analysis were 
used to create a risk model based on remained 9 genes. In both the training 
(TCGA database) and validation (International Cancer Genome Consortium, ICGC) 
cohorts, a 9-gene signature could successfully discriminate high-risk 
individuals (all p < 0.01). Immune infiltration differed significantly between 
the high-risk and low-risk groups. The model's area under the ROC curve was 
0.67, and a nomograph was created to assist clinician.
CONCLUSION: EccDNA is found in UACC-1598-4, and part of its genes linked to OV 
prognosis. Patients with OV may be efficiently evaluated using a prognostic 
model based on eccDNA genes, including SLC7A1, NTN1, ADORA1, PADI2, SULT2B1,

self-report pain, therefore the availability of valid and reliable means of 
assessing pain is critical.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-review sought to identify evidence that could guide the 
selection of appropriate tools in this vulnerable population.
METHODS: We searched Scopus, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, MIDRIS, EMCare and Google 
Scholar for eligible systematic reviews. Eligible reviews documented 
psychometric properties of available observational tools used to assess pain in 
infants.
RESULTS: A total of 516 reviews were identified of which 11 met our inclusion 
criteria. We identified 36 pain assessment tools (evaluated in 11 reviews) of 
which seven were reported in at least three reviews. The level of evidence 
reported on the psychometric properties of pain assessment tools varied widely 
ranging from low to good reliability and validity, whilst there are limited data

injury. Vitamin E is a potential strategy for anal sphincter muscle repair via 
its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and protective properties 
against myocyte loss. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the water-soluble form of 
vitamin E efficacy in repairing anal sphincter muscle defects in rabbits.
METHODS: Twenty-one male rabbits were equally assigned to the intact (without 
any intervention), control (sphincterotomy), and Trolox (sphincterotomy + Trolox 
administration) groups. Ninety days after sphincterotomy, the resting and 
squeeze pressures were evaluated by manometry, and the number of motor units in 
the sphincterotomy site was calculated by electromyography. Also, the amount of 
muscle and collagen in the injury site was investigated by Mallory's trichrome 
staining.
RESULTS: Ninety days after the intervention, the resting and squeeze pressures 
in the intact and Trolox groups were significantly higher than in the control 
group (P = 0.001). Moreover, the total collagen percentage of the sphincterotomy 
site was significantly lower in the Trolox group than in the control group 
(P = 0.002), and the total muscle percentage was significantly higher in the 
Trolox group compared to the control group (P = 0.001). Also, the motor unit 
number was higher in the Trolox group than in the control group (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Trolox administration in the rabbit sphincterotomy model can 
decrease the amount of collagen and increase muscle, leading to improved anal 
sphincter electromyography and manometry results. Therefore, Trolox is a 
potential treatment strategy for FI.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12876-023-02842-z

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Complexity and heterogeneity of the tumor niche are closely 
associated with the failure of therapeutic protocols. Unfortunately, most data 
have been obtained from conventional 2D culture systems which are not completely 
comparable to in vivo microenvironments. Reconstructed 3D cultures composed of 
multiple cells are valid cell-based tumor models to recapitulate in vivo-like 
interaction between the cancer cells and stromal cells and the oncostatic 
properties of therapeutics. Here, we aimed to assess the tumoricidal properties 
of melatonin on close-to-real colon cancer tumoroids in in vitro conditions.
METHODS: Using the hanging drop method, colon cancer tumoroids composed of three 
cell lines, including adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, fibroblasts (HFFF2), and 
endothelial cells (HUVECs) at a ratio of 2: 1: 1, respectively were developed 
using 2.5% methylcellulose. Tumoroids were exposed to different concentrations 
of melatonin, from 0.005 to 0.8 mM and 4 to 10 mM, for 48 h. The survival rate 
was measured by MTT and LDH leakage assays. Protein levels of endocan and VEGF 
were assessed using western blotting. Using histological examination (H & E) 
staining, the integrity of cells within the tumoroid parenchyma was monitored.
RESULTS: Despite the reduction of viability rate in lower doses, the structure 
of tumoroids remained unchanged. In contrast, treatment of tumoroids with higher 
doses of melatonin, 4 and 10 mM, led to disaggregation of cells and reduction of 
tumoroid diameter compared to the non-treated control tumoroids (p < 0.05). By 
increasing melatonin concentration from 4 to 10 mM, the number of necrotic cells 
increased. Data showed the significant suppression of endocan in 
melatonin-treated tumoroids related to the non-treated controls (p < 0.05). 
According to our data, melatonin in higher doses did not alter protein levels of 
VEGF (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin can exert its tumoricidal properties on colon cancer 
tumoroids via the reduction of tumor cell viability and inhibition of the 
specific pro-angiogenesis factor.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12935-023-02951-5

structure offset with the natural log of the number of births in each county and 
year.
RESULTS: County-level incidence of eHDP had a non-statistically significant 
increase of almost 3% (AAPC: 2.84, 95% CI: -4.26, 10.46), while maternal smoking 
decreased by almost 6% over the study period (AAPC:-5.8%, 95%CI: -7.5, -4.1), 
Risk factors for eHDP such as pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 30 and proportion of births to 
women ≥ 35 years of age increased by 2.3% and 3.4% respectively (BMI AAPC:2.3, 
95% CI: 0.94, 3.7; ≥ 35 years AAPC:3.4, 95% CI: 0.66, 6.3). After adjusting for 
race, county-level proportions of college attainment, and maternal smoking 
throughout pregnancy, counties with the highest proportion of births to women 
with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 reported an eHDP incidence 20% higher than counties with a 
lower proportion of births to mothers with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and a 20% increase 
in eHDP incidence (aRR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.44). We also observed that 
counties with the highest proportion vs. the lowest of mothers ≥ 35 years old 
(> 6.1%) had a 26% higher incidence of eHDP (RR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.04, 1.50) 
compared to counties with the lowest incidence (< 2.5%). We further identified 
two county-level clusters of elevated eHDP rates. We also observed that counties 
with the highest vs. lowest proportion of mothers ≥ 34 years old (> 6.1% 
vs. < 2.5%) had a 26% increase in the incidence of eHDP (RR = 1.26, 95% CI: 
1.04, 1.50). We further identified two county-level clusters of elevated 
incidence of eHDP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two county-level clusters of eHDP, 
county-level covariates associated with eHDP, and that while increasing, the 
average rate of increase for eHDP was not statistically significant. This study 
also identified the reduction in maternal smoking over the study period and the 
concerning increase in rates of elevated pre-pregnancy BMI among mothers. 
Further work to explore the population-level trends in this understudied 
pregnancy complication is needed to identify community factors that may 
contribute to disease and inform prevention strategies.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12884-023-05699-y

colorectal polyps. However, the longevity and complexity of the procedure makes 
it less desirable to screen for colorectal polyps in the general population. 
Therefore, it is essential to identify other independent risk factors. In this 
study, we explored the link between Hp infection, atrophic gastritis, and 
colorectal polyps to identify a new potential risk factors of colorectal polyps.
METHODS: In this study, atrophic gastritis and intestinal polyps were diagnosed 
by endoscopy and pathology. All the 792 patients in this retrospective study 
were divided into sub-groups based on the presence of colorectal polyps. The 
correlation between polyps and atrophic gastritis was analyzed using the 
chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve was used to compare the predictive value for colorectal polyps 
between Hp infection and atrophic gastritis. Binary logistic regression was 
utilized to identify independent risk factors for colorectal polyps.
RESULTS: Patients with colorectal polyps were primarily male with advanced age, 
and the number of patients with colorectal polyps had a higher association with 
smoking, alcohol drinking, and Hp infection than the control group. A positive 
correlation between the number of colorectal polyps and the severity of atrophic 
gastritis was observed. ROC analysis showed that atrophic gastritis was a better 
risk factors for colorectal polyps. Multivariate analysis identified atrophic 
gastritis as an independent risk factor for colorectal polyps (OR 2.294; 95% CI 
1.597-3.296).
CONCLUSIONS: Atrophic gastritis confirmed could be an independent risk factors 
for colorectal polyps.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12876-023-02764-w

recognition receptors act as the first sentry of plant defense. But little of 
WAK/WAKL family is known in Rosaceae.
RESULTS: In this study, 131 WAK/WAKL genes from apple, peach and strawberry were 
identified using a bioinformatics approach. Together with 68 RcWAK/RcWAKL in 
rose, we performed a comparative analysis of 199 WAK/WAKL in four Rosaceae 
crops. The phylogenetic analysis divided all the WAK/WAKL into five clades. 
Among them, the cis-elements of Clade II and Clade V promoters were enriched in 
jasmonic acid (JA) signaling and abiotic stress, respectively. And this can also 
be verified by the rose transcriptome responding to different hormone 
treatments. WAK/WAKL families have experienced a considerable proportion of 
purifying selection during evolution, but still 26 amino acid sites evolved 
under positive selection, which focused on extracellular conserved domains. 
WAK/WAKL genes presented collinearity relationship within and between crops, 
throughout four crops we mined four orthologous groups (OGs). The WAK/WAKL genes 
in OG1 and OG4 were speculated to involve in plant-Botrytis cinerea interaction, 
which were validated in rose via VIGS as well as strawberry by qRT-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: These results not only provide genetic resources and valuable 
information for the evolutionary relationship of WAK/WAKL gene family, but also 
offer a reference for future in-depth studies of Rosaceae WAK/WAKL genes.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12864-023-09371-9

45-day-old boy with feeding problem and cyanosis while feeding, and the second 
was a three-month-old girl with cough and choking after feeding from the first 
day of birth. In both cases, two separate TEFs were detected during diagnostic 
evaluation by flexible bronchoscopy. Both were repaired simultaneously through a 
cervical incision. The first patient deteriorated 13 days after the surgery,

Hereby we present a 20-year epidemiological data of haematological cancers in 
Sarawak from a population-based cancer registry.
METHODS: Haematological cancer cases with ICD-10 coded C81-C96 and ICD-O coded 
/3 diagnosed from 1996 to 2015 were retrieved from Sarawak Cancer Registry. 
Adult was defined as those 15 years and above. Incidence rate (IR) was 
calculated based on yearly Sarawak citizen population stratified to age, gender, 
and ethnic groups. Age-standardised IR (ASR) was calculated using Segi World 
Standard Population.
RESULTS: A total of 3,947 cases were retrieved and analysed. ASR was 10 and male 
predominance (IR ratio 1.32, 95%CI 1.24,1.41). Haematological cancers generally 
had a U-shaped distribution with lowest IR at age 10-14 years and exponential 
increment from age 40 years onwards, except acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 
with highest IR in paediatric 2.8 versus adult 0.5. There was a significant 
difference in ethnic and specific categories of haematological cancers, of 
which, in general, Bidayuh (IR ratio 1.13, 95%CI 1.00, 1.27) and Melanau (IR 
ratio 0.54, 95%CI 0.45, 0.65) had the highest and lowest ethnic-specific IR, 
respectively, in comparison to Malay. The ASR (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute 
myeloid leukaemia, ALL, chronic myeloid leukaemia, and plasma cell neoplasm) 
showed a decreasing trend over the 20 years, -2.09 in general, while Hodgkin 
lymphoma showed an increasing trend of + 2.80. There was crude rate difference 
between the 11 administrative divisions of Sarawak.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: The suicide rate in Korea was the highest among the member countries 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) for 2013-2016 
and 2018-2020. In korea, suicide was the leading cause of death among 
individuals aged 10-39, and the second leading cause of death for aged 40-59. 
Thus, this study aimed to examine the Werther effect of the suicides of three 
Korean idol singers (Jonghyun: December 18, 2017, Sulli: October 14, 2019, and 
Hara Gu: November 24, 2019).
METHODS: The study conducted Poisson regression and used the cause-of-death 
statistics microdata from 2016 to 2020 provided by Statistics Korea. The case 
periods ranged from the day of the suicide of each celebrity to 10 weeks after. 
The control periods were all weeks from 2016 to 2020, excluding the case 
periods.
RESULTS: The suicide rates in Korea significantly increased by 1.21, 1.30, and 
1.28 times after the deaths of Jonghyun, Sulli, and Hara Gu, respectively. The 
Werther effect was more evident in women than men. Suicide rate among 
individuals aged 10-29 years was greater than those for other age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the rate of copycat suicides increased 
after three celebrity singers in Korea died by suicide. Nevertheless, the rate 
of suicide after the suicide of the three celebrity singers was lower than those

for people with severe mental illness (SMI), there are still limitations to 
their implementation and replicability in a consensual way, particularly in 
Latin American countries. The REINTEGRA program aims to be a standardized model 
of comprehensive rehabilitation focused on psychosocial and cognitive 
improvement through a set of interventions on different areas of people's 
functionality, with the goal of reintegrating people with SMI into the labour 
market. In this paper we summarize the protocol for its subsequent 
implementation in a mental health institution in Mexico.
METHOD: The protocol is based on a quasi-experimental, prospective longitudinal 
study, with a pragmatic or naturalistic control group. It will be carried out in 
three phases. Phase 1 consists of a series of interventions focused on 
psychosocial improvement; Phase 2 focuses on cognitive and behavioral 
improvement treatments; and Phase 3 targets psychosocial recovery through 
rehabilitation and reintegration into the labour market. The overall procedure 
will be monitored with standarized evaluations at different stages of the 
program.
DISCUSSION: This study presents a model of integral rehabilitation of people 
with SMI. At the moment, one of the obstacles to overcome is the organization 
and procedural control of the different actors needed for its implementation 
(nurses, psychologists, doctors, companies, institutions, etc.). REINTEGRA will 
be the first comprehensive rehabilitation model that includes systematized 
procedures for job reinsertion for people with SMI in Mexico, which aims to be a 
standardized tool of easy adaptation and the replicability for other mental 
health centers and institutions.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12888-023-04835-4

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel in combination with ramucirumab is the standard of care 
second-line therapy in gastro-esophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA). As the number of 
taxane pretreated patients in the perioperative or first-line setting is 
increasing, it is unknown whether these patients benefit from re-applying a 
taxane in using the combination of paclitaxel and ramucirumab. Furthermore, the 
rates of neurotoxicity with first-line FOLFOX or FLOT range from 30%-70%, making 
second-line taxane-containing therapy less suitable to a meaningful portion of 
patients. This patient group is likely to benefit from a taxane-free second-line 
chemotherapy regimen, such as FOLFIRI and ramucirumab (FOLFIRI-Ram). Therefore, 
the RAMIRIS phase III trial evaluates the effects of the regimen of FOLFIRI-Ram 
in the second-line treatment after a taxane-based chemotherapy in patients with 
advanced GEA.
METHODS: The RAMIRIS trial is a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase II/III 
study comparing treatment of FOLFIRI-Ram (arm A) with paclitaxel and ramucirumab 
(arm B). The Phase II is already closed with 111 enrolled patients. In the phase 
III, 318 taxane-pretreated patients with advanced GEA will be recruited and 
randomized 1:1 to FOLFIRI (5-FU 2400 mg/m2 over 46 h i.v., irinotecan 180 mg/m2 
i.v.; 5-FU 400 mg/m2 bolus; leucovorin 400 mg/m2 i.v.; on day 1 and 15, q28) 
with ramucirumab 8 mg/kg every two weeks (Arm A) or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (days 1, 
8, 15, q28) with ramucirumab 8 mg/kg every two weeks (Arm B). The primary 
endpoints are overall survival (OS) and objective overall response rate (ORR). 
Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate 
and safety and quality of life as assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire.
DISCUSSION: The already completed RAMIRIS phase II demonstrated feasibility and 
efficacy of FOLFIRI-Ram. Especially docetaxel-pretreated patients seemed to 
markedly benefit from FOLFIRI-Ram, with favorable response- and PFS rates and 
lower toxicity. This offers a rationale for the phase III trial. If the RAMIRIS 
III trial transfers and confirms the results, they will affect the current 
treatment guidelines, recommending the combination therapy of FOLFIRI-Ram for 
taxane-pretreated patients with advanced GEA.

treatment has recently become popular, prospectively evaluated evidence is 
limited. We started a multidisciplinary-collaborated cancer support team (MCST) 
to facilitate cooperation across multidisciplinary medical staff in our hospital 
and established clinical evidence of supportive care. This study aimed to 
prospectively evaluate the clinical activity and effect of MCST in patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer receiving chemotherapy.
METHODS: This is a single-center, single-arm, observational study. Patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer scheduled to receive chemotherapy are enrolled and 
supported by the MCST. The primary endpoints are the number of interventions by 
medical staff and the number of patients who showed improvement in side effects. 
The secondary endpoints are the severity of side effects, medical expenses, 
number of consultations, the acceptance rate of prescription recommendations, 
adjuvant chemotherapy completion rates, dose intensity, and time required for 
co-medical intervention. In addition, medical staff and attending physicians 
evaluate all adverse events.
DISCUSSION: This study is expected to contribute to establishing new 
cancer-supportive care teams for patients with gastrointestinal cancer receiving 
chemotherapy and those with cancer receiving chemotherapy.

not available.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a male MM patient under salvage therapy 
including proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib following chemotherapy and autologous 
stem cell transplantation. The patient then developed acute kidney injury with 
clinical and laboratory signs of TMA. Hemodialysis became necessary and 
treatment with plasma exchange was initiated followed by therapy with C5 
complement inhibitor eculizumab which led to amelioration of kidney function and 
hemolysis parameters.

rural tourism (PRT). From this perspective, this paper empirically analyses how 
the health and safety dimensions influence the happiness of hotel managers and 
rural tourists in the post-Covid 19 era.
METHODS: A theory-based structural equation model will be carried out of 
activation of norms, that measure variables: sanitary, socioeconomic, and 
safety. Precisely, we will measure how those three attributes affect the 
managers-guests' health in rural areas and their search for happiness at the 
rural destination. Based on the above, a field of study has been 215 rural 
tourist accommodations in the Extremadura region (Spain) and a sample population 
of 443 guests. Data were organised through the SEM-PLS path modelling.
RESULTS: The results achieved statistically show the need to undertake a new 
model of healthier and safer tourism consumption that values the tourist 
resources of rural areas, especially nearby and sustainable destinations, based 
on the guiding principles of safety, health, and happiness.
CONCLUSIONS: The first conclusion is that promoting tourist destinations under 
safe and healthy conditions has become a priority objective in the tourism 
industry. The second conclusion that follows from the first is that the 
variables safety and health and the pursuit of happiness are essential factors 
in promoting tourist destinations for rural hotel managers and rural tourists. 
The third conclusion related to the first two is that the opportunity that this 
study provides to develop strategies of an innovative, sustainable, and creative 
nature based on the relationships of the new trinomial of health, safety and 
happiness, from the perspective of happiness management.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-15849-8

treatment options usually include combination regimens of folinic acid, 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX or mFOLFIRINOX) 
or gemcitabine based regimens such as in combination with albumin-bound 
paclitaxel (GEM + nab-PTX). After progression, multiple regimens including 
NALIRI + 5-FU and folinic acid, FOLFIRINOX, 5-FU-based oxaliplatin doublets 
(OFF, FOLFOX, or XELOX), or 5-FU-based monotherapy (FL, capecitabine, or S-1) 
are considered appropriate by major guidelines. This network meta-analysis (NMA) 
aimed to compare the efficacy of different treatment strategies tested as 
second-line regimens for patients with mPDAC after first-line gemcitabine-based 
systemic treatment.
METHODS: Randomized phase II and III clinical trials (RCTs) were included if 
they were published or presented in English. Trials of interest compared two 
active systemic treatments as second-line regimens until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. We performed a Bayesian NMA with published hazard ratios 
(HRs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the comparative 
effectiveness of different second-line therapies for mPDAC. The main outcomes of 
interest were overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS), 
secondary endpoints were grade 3-4 toxicities. We calculated the relative 
ranking of agents for each outcome as their surface under the cumulative ranking 
(SUCRA). A higher SUCRA score meant a higher ranking for efficacy outcomes.
RESULTS: A NMA of 9 treatments was performed for OS (n = 2521 patients 
enrolled). Compared with 5-FU + folinic acid both irinotecan or 
NALIRI + fluoropyrimidines had a trend to better OS (HR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.21-2.75 
and HR = 0.74, 95%CI 0.31-1.85). Fluoropyrimidines + folinic acid + oxaliplatin 
were no better than the combination without oxaliplatin. The analysis of 
treatment ranking showed that the combination of NALIRI + 5-FU + folinic acid 
was most likely to yield the highest OS results (SUCRA = 0.7). Furthermore, the 
NMA results indicated that with the highest SUCRA score (SUCRA = 0.91), 
NALIRI + 5-FU + folinic acid may be the optimal choice for improved PFS amongst 
all regimens studied.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the NMA results, NALIRI + 5-FU, and folinic acid may 
represent the best second-line treatment for improved survival outcomes in 
mPDAC. Further evidence from prospective trials is needed to determine the best 
treatment option for this group of patients.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12876-023-02853-w

receiving quality antenatal care (ANC), intrapartum care, and postnatal care 
(PNC) services by women in Ethiopia. The quality of care a woman receives during 
ANC, intrapartum care, and PNC services affects the health of the woman and her 
child and her likelihood of seeking care in the future.
METHODS: Data from the nationally representative Ethiopia Mini Demographic and 
Health Survey 2019 were analysed for 5,527 mothers who gave birth within five 
years preceding the survey. We defined quality ANC as having: blood pressure 
measurement, urine and blood tests, informed of danger signs, iron 
supplementation, and nutritional counselling during ANC services; quality 
intrapartum care as having: a health facility birth, skilled birth assistance, 
and a newborn put to the breast within one hour of birth during intrapartum care 
services; and quality PNC as having: PNC within two days; cord examination; 
temperature measurement, and counselling on danger signs and breastfeeding of 
the newborn; and healthcare provider's observation of breastfeeding during PNC 
services. We used multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analyses 
specifying three-level models: a woman/household, a cluster, and an 
administrative region to determine predictors of each care quality. The analyses 
employed sampling weights and were adjusted for sampling design.
RESULTS: Thirty-six percent (n = 1,048), 43% (n = 1,485), and 21% (n = 374) 
women received quality ANC, intrapartum care and PNC services, respectively. 
Private healthcare facilities provided higher-quality ANC and PNC but 
poor-quality intrapartum care, compared to public health facilities. Having four 
or more ANC visits, commencing ANC during the first trimester, and higher 
women's education levels and household wealth indices were positive predictors 
of quality ANC use. Government health posts were less likely to provide quality 
ANC. Wealthier, urban-residing women with education and four or more ANC 
contacts were more likely to receive quality intrapartum care. Women who 
received quality ANC and skilled birth assistance were more likely to receive 
quality PNC. Teenage mothers were more likely to receive quality intrapartum 
care, but were less likely to receive quality PNC than mothers aged 20-49.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend standardizing the contents of ANC provided in all 
healthcare facilities; and promoting early and four or more ANC contacts, 
effectiveness, sensitivity and vigilance of care provided to teenage mothers, 
and women's education and economic empowerment.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-15938-8

interest in mammals is frequently limited to autosomes, with the X chromosome 
excluded because of its hemizygosity in males. This study aimed to assess the 
importance of the X chromosome in the genetic determinism of 11 complex traits 
related to milk production, milk composition, mastitis resistance, fertility, 
and stature in 236,496 cows from three major French dairy breeds (Holstein, 
Montbéliarde, and Normande) and three breeds of regional importance (Abondance, 
Tarentaise, and Vosgienne).
RESULTS: Estimates of the proportions of heritability due to autosomes and X 
chromosome (h²X) were consistent among breeds. On average over the 11 traits, 
h²X=0.008 and the X chromosome explained ~ 3.5% of total genetic variance. GWAS 
was performed within-breed at the sequence level (~ 200,000 genetic variants) 
and then combined in a meta-analysis. QTL were identified for most breeds and 
traits analyzed, with the exception of Tarentaise and Vosgienne and two 
fertility traits. Overall, 3, 74, 59, and 71 QTL were identified in Abondance, 
Montbéliarde, Normande, and Holstein, respectively, and most were associated 
with the most-heritable traits (milk traits and stature). The meta-analyses, 
which assessed a total of 157 QTL for the different traits, highlighted new QTL 
and refined the positions of some QTL found in the within-breed analyses. 
Altogether, our analyses identified a number of functional candidate genes, with 
the most notable being GPC3, MBNL3, HS6ST2, and DMD for dairy traits; TMEM164, 
ACSL4, ENOX2, HTR2C, AMOT, and IRAK1 for udder health; MAMLD1 and COL4A6 for 
fertility; and NRK, ESX1, GPR50, GPC3, and GPC4 for stature.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of the X chromosome in the 
genetic determinism of complex traits in dairy cattle and highlights new 
functional candidate genes and variants for these traits. These results could 
potentially be extended to other species as many X-linked genes are shared among 
mammals.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12864-023-09438-7

adolescents and have adverse effects on physical and mental health. However, 
little is known about the relationship between NSSI and alexithymia, or the 
underlying mechanisms that could explain this relationship. This study aimed to 
elucidate the current status of NSSI in adolescent depression, and analyze the 
relationship between alexithymia, loneliness, resilience, and adolescent 
depression with NSSI, so as to provide a theoretical basis for psychotherapeutic 
interventions.
METHOD: The study sample involved inpatients and outpatients from 12 hospitals 
across China and adolescents with depression who met the DSM-5 diagnostic 
criteria for depression episode. The following scales were used: The Functional 
Assessment of Self-Mutilation, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale, 
and Connor Davidson Resilience Scale.
RESULTS: The detection rate of NSSI in adolescents with depression from 
2021.01.01-2022.01.01 was 76.06% (1782/2343). Spearman's correlation analysis 
revealed a significant correlation between alexithymia, loneliness, resilience 
and NSSI in depressed adolescents, and the results of the non-parametric test 
showed that the differences between the two groups for each factor were 
statistically significant. Binary logistic regression results showed that 
alexithymia (B = 0.023, p = 0.003, OR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.008-1.038) and 
depression (B = 0.045, p < 0.001, OR = 1.046, 95% CI: 1.026-1.066) are risk 
factors for NSSI, resilience (B = - 0.052, p < 0.001, OR = 0.949, 95% CI: 
0.935 - 0.964) is a protective factor for NSSI. Alexithymia directly predicted 
NSSI and also indirectly influenced NSSI through the mediated effect of 
resilience. Loneliness moderates the first half of the path of this mediated 
model.
CONCLUSION: The present study confirms a moderated mediation effect: Alexithymia 
can have an impact on NSSI behaviors in depressed adolescents through the 
mediating role of resilience. Loneliness, as a moderating variable, moderated 
the first half of the pathway of the mediating model. We discuss perspectives 
for future research and interventions based on the findings of the study.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12888-023-04938-y

obesity to lose weight is often a key objective but a complex and difficult 
challenge. Our aim in this study was to explore parents' (and guardians') 
perspectives on the challenges they have faced in assisting their 
children/adolescents with severe obesity to lead a healthy lifestyle.
METHODS: Thirteen parents/guardians were interviewed from a pool of families who 
had been referred but did not engage between 2016 and 2018 (N = 103), with the 
Perth Children's Hospital Healthy Weight Service, a clinical obesity program for 
children/adolescents (parent age M = 43.2 years, children age M = 10.3 years). 
Using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, we identified 3 broad 
themes.
RESULTS: Parental weight-related factors reflected parents' own lifelong obesity 
narrative and its effect on their own and their families' ability to live a 
healthy lifestyle. Perceived inevitability of obesity in their child reflected 
parents' feelings that the obesity weight status of their children/adolescent 
was a persistent and overwhelming problem that felt 'out of control'. Lastly, 
parents reported challenges getting medical help stemming from co-morbid medical 
diagnosis in their child/adolescent, and difficulties with medical

pragmatic language development in n = 77 Italian preschool children 
(49-84 months) with and without neurodevelopmental disorders. The sample 
included 62 children without psychiatric history (n = 34 females, n = 27 males) 
and n = 15 children with psychiatric history (2 females, n = 13 males). Eight 
cases (n = 6 males, n = 2 females, 59-75 months) were matched for age and 
gender. The neurodevelopmental disorder group used the Targeted Observation of 
Pragmatics in Children's Conversations (TOPICC) tool. Pragmatic language skills 
were assessed with the Pragmatic Language Abilities (APL), Children's 
Communication Checklist-Version 2 (CCC-2), and TOPICC scales. Results showed no 
significant relationship between gender and pragmatic language development 
subscales, except for a marginally significant relationship with figurative 
metaphor scores. Age was positively correlated with verbal metaphor, metaphor, 
implied meaning, and overall pragmatic language skills, but not with figurative 
metaphor or situations scores. Paired samples t-tests and Wilcoxon tests 
compared matched groups, revealing significant differences between children with 
and without neurodevelopmental disorders on the TOPICC, APL, and CCC-2 tools. 
The findings highlight the importance of early identification and intervention 
for children with pragmatic language impairment (PLI) and the need for further 
research with larger samples.","DOI: 10.1080/21622965.2023.2224483

been associated with an increased risk of lip cancer, the occupational risk 
profile of lip cancer and its change over time remain poorly known. This study 
aims to evaluate the incidence of lip cancer across different occupations in the 
Nordic countries.
METHODS: The Nordic Occupational Cancer Study (NOCCA) covers 14.9 million people 
and includes 45 years of cancer incidence data, from 1961 to 2005, linked to 
occupational categories for all the five Nordic populations. Standardized 
incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to 
quantify the risk of lip cancer across occupational categories relative to the 
entire national populations.
RESULTS: There were a total of 14,477 male and 3008 female lip cancer patients 
identified during follow up. The highest SIRs were observed among male fishermen 
(SIR 2.26, 95% CI: 2.04-2.50), gardeners (SIR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.48-1.72), and 
farmers (SIR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.55-1.66). A significantly reduced risk of lip 
cancer (SIR < 0.50) was observed among male physicians, teachers, religious 
workers, artistic workers, journalists, administrators, printers, waiters, and 
hairdressers. Among women, no occupations were associated with an increased risk 
of lip cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of lip cancer varies widely between outdoor and 
indoor occupations. Occupations involving outdoor activity and exposure to 
sunlight show the most elevated SIRs.","Plain Language Summary: Certain outdoor occupations, such as agriculture and 
fishery, have been associated with an increased risk of lip cancer. However, the 
occupational risk profile of lip cancer and its change over time remain poorly 
known. This study highlights the excess risk of lip cancer among men with 
outdoor occupations and further corroborates previous studies. Efforts to 
counsel outdoor workers on the risk and prevention of lip cancer are needed to 
reduce the societal burden of the disease.","DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2023.2224053

hemorrhage (aSAH), invisible symptoms might be easily overlooked during 
consultations in the outpatient clinic. We hypothesize that the Questionnaire 
for the Screening of Symptoms in aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SOS-SAH), a 
disease-specific patient-reported outcome measure, might aid in screening for 
symptoms after aSAH. The objective of this explorative study is to evaluate the 
perceived impact of using the SOS-SAH in daily clinical practice for patients 
after aSAH, as well as to explore potential barriers to further implementation.
METHODS: This multi-method study consists of a quantitative and a qualitative 
component. To evaluate differences in quality of care, a patient experience 
survey was sent to patients receiving usual care and to patients who received 
the SOS-SAH. A multiple linear regression model was applied, with the 
intervention group and case mix adjusters as independent variables. We described 
differences in the number of symptoms discussed between patients receiving usual 
care and those receiving care post-implementation. Following implementation, 16 
patients and 6 healthcare professionals were interviewed about their perceptions 
concerning the impact of and barriers to using the SOS-SAH. A thematic analysis 
was performed to identify the main themes.
RESULTS: The survey did not reveal any differences between the usual-care group 
and the post-implementation group on the scales of the patient experience 
survey. After implementation of the SOS-SAH, the number of symptoms discussed 
during consultation did not increase. The interviews suggest that the SOS-SAH 
may improve the preparation of patients by providing them with greater insight 
into their complaints and by raising issues for the consultation. It could also 
enhance the structure and efficiency of consultation, in addition to improving 
communication about issues that matter to patients. All patients and healthcare 
professionals recommended continuing the use of the SOS-SAH in daily practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Although no quantitative improvements were found in patient 
experience and symptoms discussed during consultation, implementation of the 
SOS-SAH could aid in screening for symptoms in patients after aSAH, and it might 
have a positive influence on patient preparation, while helping to structure 
consultations between patients and healthcare professionals.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12883-023-03280-w

readmitted to the hospital is higher if they have a higher medication regimen 
complexity index (MRCI) compared to those with a lower MRCI. The objective of 
this study was to investigate whether there is a correlation between the MRCI 
score and the frequency of hospital readmissions (30-day, 90-day, and 1-year) 
among elderly patients with HF.
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, MRCI scores were 
calculated using a well-established tool. Patients were categorized into high 
(≥ 15) or low (< 15) MRCI score groups. The primary outcome examined the 
association between MRCI scores and 30-day hospital readmission rates. Secondary 
outcomes included the relationships between MRCI scores and 90-day readmission, 
one-year readmission, and mortality rates. Multivariate logistic regression was 
employed to assess the 30- and 90-day readmission rates, while Kaplan-Meier 
analysis was utilized to plot mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were included. The mean MRCI score for all 
patients was 33.43. 90% of patients had a high score. There was no link between 
a high MCRI score and a high 30-day readmission rate (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.99-1.05; 
p < 0.13). A high MCRI score was associated with an initial significant increase 
in the 90-day readmission rate (odd ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07; p < 0.022), 
but not after adjusting for independent factors (odd ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 
0.95-1.03; p < 0.487). There was no significant difference between high and low 
MRCI scores in their one-year readmission rate.
CONCLUSION: The study's results indicate that there is no correlation between a 
higher MRCI score and the rates of hospital readmission or mortality among 
elderly patients with HF. Therefore, it can be concluded that the medication 
regimen complexity index does not appear to be a significant predictor of 
hospital readmission or mortality in this population.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12877-023-04062-2

eating habits are among the important steps to promoting eating behavior. The 
current study aims to assess the nutrition knowledge (NK) among a convenient 
sample in four different countries, determine the association between different 
demographic factors and NK, and investigate the need for future interventions on 
nutrition in the four selected countries.
METHODS: A cross-sectional multi-national survey study among a convenient sample 
of 8,191 subjects from Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan who undertook 
surveys between January 2019 and January 2020. A pre-tested interview 
questionnaire was utilized for data collection from study participants. It 
included three sections: i) Sociodemographic characteristics:. ii). Section two 
included twenty-one questions related to NK.. iii). Section three included one 
question about NK sources.
RESULTS: About three-quarters showed inadequate nutrition knowledge (73.1%). 
Youth (15-24 yrs.) were more dependent on social media, with 87% using it as a 
primary source of NK, while adults (≥ 25 yrs.) demonstrated that 43% of them 
used social media. In contrast, TV was more prominent among them, with 
participants' characteristics such as living with parents, body mass index, and 
country of residence showing no association with NK. However, female sex, 
education, and reading nutrition articles are significantly correlated with 
adequate knowledge (p < 0.001). Significant predictors of satisfactory knowledge 
were age, sex, education, living with parents, and reading nutrition articles.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed low levels of NK indicating an urgent need to 
implement educational programs to promote nutrition knowledge. As NK is a 
modifiable determinant of diet intake and can positively impact the need for 
developing strategies in counselling and raising awareness among the general 
population to improve their health status.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12889-023-15791-9

carbapenemase-producing organism (CPO) intestinal carriers is essential for 
infection prevention and control. Molecular diagnostic methods can produce 
results in as little as 1 h, but require special instrumentation and are 
expensive. Therefore, it is urgent to find an alternative method. The broth 
enrichment-multiplex lateral flow immunochromatographic assay was recently 
reported, but using it to directly detect CPO intestinal carriers in rectal 
swabs still requires the evaluation of many samples. The aim of this study was 
to compare the performance of these two methods, and to explore the control 
measures of CPO infection.
METHODS: Through CPO selective culture, PCR and DNA sequencing, 100 rectal swabs 
confirmed to be CPO-positive and 100 rectal swabs with negative results were 
collected continuously. After eluting the rectal swabs with saline, three 
aliquots were used: one for counting, one for detection by Xpert Carba-R, and 
one for culture in broth for 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 4 h, followed by NG-Test 
CARBA 5 assessment. The sensitivity and specificity of the NG-Test CARBA 5 
method after different incubation times were calculated. The limit of detection 
(LoD) of this assay after 4 h broth incubation was estimated by examining the 
bacterial suspensions and simulated faecal suspensions prepared with CPOs 
producing different types of carbapenemases.
RESULTS: Xpert Carba-R demonstrated a combined sensitivity of 99.0% and 
specificity of 98.0%. The sensitivity and specificity were higher than 90.0% for 
the different enzyme types. The specificities of five common carbapenemases 
detected by the broth enrichment NG-Test CARBA 5 combined method after different 
incubation times were 100%. The sensitivities increased with increasing 
incubation time. At 4 h, the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), 
New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), imipenemase (IMP), Verona 
integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM), and oxacillinase (OXA) -48 
detection sensitivities were 93.0%, 96.3%, 100%, 100% and 85.7%, respectively. 
The LoDs were between 102 and 104 CFU/mL for all five enzymes after 4 h of 
incubation.

lateral flow immunochromatographic assay can be used as a new method for 
screening CPOs in rectal swabs.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12879-023-08244-6

care. Medication adherence is recognized as the most effective measure for 
managing and preventing multimorbidity. Studies have shown that medication 
literacy has a positive effect on medication adherence in patients with 
multimorbidity. However, limited knowledge exists regarding the underlying 
mechanisms of this relationship in older adults with multimorbidity. Therefore, 
the aim of this study was to investigate the mediating role of self-efficacy in 
the association between medication literacy and medication adherence in this 
population.
METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional design and convenience sampling 
method to survey older patients with multimorbidity in six communities in 
Zhengzhou, China, from July 12, 2021, to December 15, 2021. Participants were 
assessed using a demographic questionnaire, the Chinese Version of the 
Medication Literacy Scale (C-MLS), the Self-Efficacy for Appropriate Medication 
Use Scale (SEAMS), and the Chinese Version of the Morisky Medication Adherence 
Scale-8 (C-MMAS-8). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, 
one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation analysis, and mediation 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 350 elderly patients met the inclusion criteria, and 328 
valid questionnaires were collected. The mean age of the participants was 
74.90 ± 7.37 years, with a slightly higher proportion of males (55.8%) than 
females (44.2%). The mean score for medication adherence was 4.85 ± 1.57, 
indicating poor medication adherence among the participants. Medication 
adherence scores varied significantly among participants of different ages, 
education levels, employment statuses and kinds of medication (p < 0.01). Scores 
for medication literacy and self-efficacy showed a significant positive 
correlation with medication adherence scores (all p < 0.001). The standardized 
coefficient for the total effect and direct effect of medication literacy on 
medication adherence was 0.268 (95% CI: 0.201, 0.335) and 0.187 (95% CI: 0.123, 
0.252), respectively. After introducing self-efficacy into the model, the 
standardized coefficient for the indirect effect was 0.081 (95% CI: 0.049, 
0.120), indicating that self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship 
between medication literacy and medication adherence, accounting for 30.22% of 
the total effect.
CONCLUSION: This study might suggest that medication literacy indirectly 
affected medication adherence in older people with multimorbidity through 
self-efficacy. Health care providers should be aware of the importance of 
improving medication literacy and implement strategies aimed at increasing 
self-efficacy to achieve the goal of improving medication adherence in older 
adults with multimorbidity.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12877-023-04072-0

antibacterial resistance (ABR) is individuals' use of antibiotics (ABs) to treat 
illness. To better understand motivations and context for antibiotic use we use 
the concept of a patient treatment-seeking pathway: a treatment journey 
encompassing where patients go when they are unwell, what motivates their 
choices, and how they obtain antibiotics. This paper investigates patterns and 
determinants of patient treatment-seeking pathways, and how they intersect with 
AB use in East Africa, a region where ABR-attributable deaths are exceptionally 
high.
METHODS: The Holistic Approach to Unravelling Antibacterial Resistance (HATUA) 
Consortium collected quantitative data from 6,827 adult outpatients presenting 
with urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda 
between February 2019- September 2020, and conducted qualitative in-depth 
patient interviews with a subset (n = 116). We described patterns of 
treatment-seeking visually using Sankey plots and explored explanations and 
motivations using mixed-methods. Using Bayesian hierarchical regression 
modelling, we investigated the associations between socio-demographic, economic, 
healthcare, and attitudinal factors and three factors related to ABR: 
self-treatment as a first step, having a multi-step treatment pathway, and 
consuming ABs.
RESULTS: Although most patients (86%) sought help from medical facilities in the 
first instance, many (56%) described multi-step, repetitive treatment-seeking 
pathways, which further increased the likelihood of consuming ABs. Higher 
socio-economic status patients were more likely to consume ABs and have 
multi-step pathways. Reasons for choosing providers (e.g., cost, location, time) 
were conditioned by wider structural factors such as hybrid healthcare systems 
and AB availability.
CONCLUSION: There is likely to be a reinforcing cycle between complex, 
repetitive treatment pathways, AB consumption and ABR. A focus on individual 
antibiotic use as the key intervention point in this cycle ignores the 
contextual challenges patients face when treatment seeking, which include 
inadequate access to diagnostics, perceived inefficient public healthcare and 
ease of purchasing antibiotics without prescription. Pluralistic healthcare 
landscapes may promote more complex treatment seeking and therefore 
inappropriate AB use. We recommend further attention to healthcare system 
factors, focussing on medical facilities (e.g., accessible diagnostics, 
patient-doctor interactions, information flows), and community AB access points 
(e.g., drug sellers).",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12879-023-08392-9

body size, are unclear because waist and hip circumferences are correlated 
strongly positively with body mass index (BMI).
METHODS: We evaluated body shape with the allometric ""a body shape index"" (ABSI) 
and hip index (HI), which compare waist and hip circumferences, correspondingly, 
among individuals with the same weight and height. We examined associations of 
ABSI, HI, and BMI (per one standard deviation increment) with breast cancer 
overall, and according to menopausal status at baseline, age at diagnosis, and 
oestrogen and progesterone receptor status (ER+/-PR+/-) in multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards models using data from the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 14.0 years, 9011 incident breast cancers 
were diagnosed among 218,276 women. Although there was little evidence for 
association of ABSI with breast cancer overall (hazard ratio HR = 0.984; 95% 
confidence interval: 0.961-1.007), we found borderline inverse associations for 
post-menopausal women (HR = 0.971; 0.942-1.000; n = 5268 cases) and breast 
cancers diagnosed at age ≥ 55 years (HR = 0.976; 0.951-1.002; n = 7043) and 
clear inverse associations for ER + PR- subtypes (HR = 0.894; 0.822-0.971; 
n = 726) and ER-PR- subtypes (HR = 0.906; 0.835-0.983 n = 759). There were no 
material associations with HI. BMI was associated strongly positively with 
breast cancer overall (HR = 1.074; 1.049-1.098), for post-menopausal women 
(HR = 1.117; 1.085-1.150), for cancers diagnosed at age ≥ 55 years (HR = 1.104; 
1.076-1.132), and for ER + PR + subtypes (HR = 1.122; 1.080-1.165; n = 3101), 
but not for PR- subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: In the EPIC cohort, abdominal obesity evaluated with ABSI was not 
associated with breast cancer risk overall but was associated inversely with the 
risk of post-menopausal PR- breast cancer. Our findings require validation in 
other cohorts and with a larger number of PR- breast cancer cases.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12885-023-11056-1

minimally invasive therapy for thyroid nodules (TNs). Understanding the 
determinants of RFA efficacy can improve treatment and prognosis. This study 
aims to investigate the relationship between ultrasound parameters of benign TNs 
and the efficacy of RFA.
METHODS: A pretest-posttest interventional study was conducted in 2021 on 250 
randomly sampled patients with benign TNs, receiving RFA. For this purpose, the 
volume reduction (VR) and the VR ratio (VRR) of the nodules were measured at the 
1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up periods after the RFA completion. The 
technical success rate (TSR) of this procedure was then categorized into four 
states, including low (VRR < 25%), moderate (VRR = 25-49%), high (VRR = 50-74%), 
and very high (VRR ≥ 75). Ordered logistic regression (OLR) was further utilized 
to investigate the effect of the ultrasound parameters of TNs on the TSR. The 
analyses were notably performed using Stata 14.2.
RESULTS: The VRR at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up periods were 38.7%, 
53.6%, 59.3%, and 59.9%, respectively. The mean VR was also statistically 
significant at all follow-ups (p < 0.001). At the 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up 
periods, the VR of over 50% was observed in 28.2%, 52.1%, and 65.2% of the 
nodules, respectively. The odds ratios (ORs) of the RFA success were found to be 
4.3 times higher for the nodules in the left lobe compared to the right lobe 
(OR: 4.31, p = 0.002), 6.3 times greater for isoechoic nodules compared to 
hyperechoic nodules (OR: 6.39, p < 0.001), 6.2 times higher for hyper-vascular 
nodules compared to hypo-vascular nodules (OR: 6.25, p = 0.005), and 2.3 times 
greater for mixed nodules compared to solid ones (OR: 2.37, p = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: The ultrasound parameters of TNs had a statistically significant 
effect on the efficacy of RFA. Small-sized, isoechoic, and hyper-vascular 
nodules, as well as those with mixed tissue, were observed to respond better to 
RFA, leading to a better prognosis in terms of VR after treatment.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s12880-023-01044-z

biliary cholangitis (PBC) and PBC-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Methods: 179 patients with PBC were selected from prospective cohorts of 
autoimmune liver diseases at the time of first diagnosis of PBC in Department of 
Hepatology, the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, from January 2016 
to January 2018, all patients with PBC received UDCA therapy, primary endpoint 
was event of HCC, the follow-up period was censored at the date of HCC. The 
relationship between level of ATX and clinical features in patients with PBC and 
its potential value in predicting disease progression and PBC-related HCC were 
analyzed. Results: The ATX level in the peripheral blood of patients with PBC 
was significantly higher than that of alcoholic liver cirrhosis(ALC) (t = 3.278, 
P = 0.001) and healthy controls(HC) (t = 6.594, P < 0.001), however, when 
comparing PBC to non-PBC related HCC, no significant difference was found 
between the groups(t=-0.240, P = 0.811). Consistent with peripheral blood 
levels, histochemical staining indicated that ATX in the liver of patients with 
PBC was significantly higher than that of HC (Z=-3.633, P < 0.001) and ALC 
(Z=-3.283, P < 0.001), and the expression of ATX in PBC with advanced 
histological stage was significantly higher than PBC with early stage (Z=-2.018, 
P = 0.034). The baseline ATX level in PBC patients without developing to HCC 
during follow-up had significant difference to patients with developing to HCC 
(228.451 ± 124.093 ng/ml vs 301.583 ± 100.512 ng/ml, t = 2.339, P = 0.021). The 
result in multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that ATX were 
independent predictors of PBC related HCC(OR 1.245, 95%CI 1.097-1.413). The 
optimal critical value of peripheral blood ATX level at baseline for predicting 
HCC was 235.254 ng/ml, with the cut-off value of 0.714 in AUC of the ROC (95% CI 
was 0.597~ 0.857), sensitivity and specificity were 84.6% and 59.0%, 
respectively. Conclusion: ATX level was significantly higher in PBC patients 
over controls, and it's concentration was correlated with UDCA efficacy and 
fibrosis stage. ATX has potential values in predicting disease progression and

stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients have been explored, racial disparities in 
quality of life (QoL) during the re-adjustment phase after transplant are yet to 
be investigated in pediatric patients. The objective of this study was to 
examine the role of patient race in QoL at least 2 years after pediatric HSCT.
PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients under 21 years 
of age at diagnosis who received an allogeneic transplant at our institution 
between January 2007 and December 2017. Patient QoL was assessed using the 
Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory Generic Score Scales (PedsQL TM 4.0) at 
least 2 years post transplant. Patient demographic, treatment, and transplant 
outcome data were obtained for subsequent analysis, where patient race was 
categorized as either Black, White, Hispanic, or Native American.
RESULTS: Data were collected on 86 pediatric patients who underwent HSCT. Forty 
patients (46.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 29 (33.7%) Hispanic, 10 (11.6%) Black, 
and seven (8.1%) Native American. Where preliminary analyses indicated a 
difference in QoL by patient race, there were no significant differences in 
physical, emotional, social, and school functioning by patient race after 
adjusting for transplant characteristics (age at transplant, sex, diagnosis, 
donor type, and conditioning regimen) and determinants of socioeconomic status 
(insurance type, estimated household income).

assess metals and metalloid exposure and estimate internal dose, as they 
integrate multiple sources and routes of exposure. Researchers are increasingly 
using multi-metal panels and innovative statistical methods to understand how 
exposure to real-world metal mixtures affects human health. Metals have both 
common and unique sources and routes of exposure, as well as biotransformation 
and elimination pathways. The development of multi-element analytical technology 
allows researchers to examine a broad spectrum of metals in their studies; 
however, their interpretation is complex as they can reflect different windows 
of exposure and several biomarkers have critical limitations. This review 
elaborates on more than 500 scientific publications to discuss major sources of 
exposure, biotransformation and elimination, and biomarkers of exposure and 
internal dose for 12 metals/metalloids, including 8 non-essential elements 
(arsenic, barium, cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel, tin, uranium) and 4 essential 
elements (manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc) commonly used in 
multi-element analyses.
RECENT FINDINGS: We conclude that not all metal biomarkers are adequate measures 
of exposure and that understanding the metabolic biotransformation and 
elimination of metals is key to metal biomarker interpretation. For example, 
whole blood is a good biomarker of exposure to arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, 
and tin, but it is not a good indicator for barium, nickel, and uranium. For 
some essential metals, the interpretation of whole blood biomarkers is unclear. 
Urine is the most commonly used biomarker of exposure across metals but it 
should not be used to assess lead exposure. Essential metals such as zinc and 
manganese are tightly regulated by homeostatic processes; thus, elevated levels 
in urine may reflect body loss and metabolic processes rather than excess 
exposure. Total urinary arsenic may reflect exposure to both organic and 
inorganic arsenic, thus, arsenic speciation and adjustment for arsebonetaine are 
needed in populations with dietary seafood consumption. Hair and nails primarily 
reflect exposure to organic mercury, except in populations exposed to high 
levels of inorganic mercury such as in occupational and environmental settings. 
When selecting biomarkers, it is also critical to consider the exposure window 
of interest. Most populations are chronically exposed to metals in the 
low-to-moderate range, yet many biomarkers reflect recent exposures. Toenails 
are emerging biomarkers in this regard. They are reliable biomarkers of 
long-term exposure for arsenic, mercury, manganese, and selenium. However, more 
research is needed to understand the role of nails as a biomarker of exposure to 
other metals. Similarly, teeth are increasingly used to assess lifelong 
exposures to several essential and non-essential metals such as lead, including 
during the prenatal window. As metals epidemiology moves towards embracing a 
multi-metal/mixtures approach and expanding metal panels to include less 
commonly studied metals, it is important for researchers to have a strong 
knowledge base about the metal biomarkers included in their research. This 
review aims to aid metals researchers in their analysis planning, facilitate 
sound analytical decision-making, as well as appropriate understanding and 
interpretation of results.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland

this knowledge gap by examining how ascribed, consensus-based status appearance,

were a stronger predictor of trust than consensus-based status judgments. This

(#)Contributed equally","Exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA), an important loss channel in optoelectronic 
devices and photosynthetic complexes, has conventionally been assumed to be an 
incoherent, diffusion-limited process. Here we challenge this assumption by 
experimentally demonstrating the ability to control EEA in molecular aggregates 
using the quantum phase relationships of excitons. We employed time-resolved 
photoluminescence microscopy to independently determine exciton diffusion 
constants and annihilation rates in two substituted perylene diimide aggregates 
featuring contrasting excitonic phase envelopes. Low-temperature EEA rates were 
found to differ by more than two orders of magnitude for the two compounds, 
despite comparable diffusion constants. Simulated rates based on a microscopic 
theory, in excellent agreement with experiments, rationalize this EEA behaviour 
based on quantum interference arising from the presence or absence of spatial 
phase oscillations of delocalized excitons. These results offer an approach for 
designing molecular materials using quantum interference where low annihilation 
can coexist with high exciton concentrations and mobilities.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41557-023-01233-x

fibril formation. The mechanisms of conversion of monomeric protein into 
condensate droplets and of the latter into fibrils remain elusive. Here, using 
mass photometry, we demonstrate that the Parkinson's disease-related protein, 
α-synuclein, can form dynamic nanoscale clusters at physiologically relevant, 
sub-saturated concentrations. Nanoclusters nucleate in bulk solution and promote 
amyloid fibril formation of the dilute-phase monomers upon ageing. Their 
formation is instantaneous, even under conditions where macroscopic assemblies 
appear only after several days. The slow growth of the nanoclusters can be 
attributed to a kinetic barrier, probably due to an interfacial penalty from the 
charged C terminus of α-synuclein. Our findings reveal that α-synuclein phase 
separation occurs at much wider ranges of solution conditions than reported so 
far. Importantly, we establish mass photometry as a promising methodology to 
detect and quantify nanoscale precursors of phase separation. We also 
demonstrate its general applicability by probing the existence of nanoclusters 
of a non-amyloidogenic protein, Ddx4n1.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41557-023-01244-8

soft tissues in the early 1960s, owing to its nonionizing, real-time, and 
cost-effective properties. Studies have provided convincing preliminary evidence 
for the use of ultrasound (US) in implant dentistry.
PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of ultrasonography (US) for measuring the 
buccal thickness of periodontal and peri-implant tissues. The secondary 
objective was to evaluate the reliability of US measurements compared to classic 
techniques, such as CBCT and directly measurements.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic literature search was conducted by three 
independent reviewers through February 2023. The inclusion criteria were 
articles investigating at least five patients/cadavers with US measurements in 
periodontal or peri-implant buccal tissues. Compliance with methodological 
reporting standards and risk of bias was assessed using EULAR and QUADAS-C 
tools, respectively. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, using 
Bland-Altman analysis. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.
RESULTS: The final selection included 12 studies examining 458 patients and 13 
cadavers, with a total of 226 implants, 1958 teeth and 60 edentulous sites. The 
body of evidence was assessed as partially compliant with methodological 
reporting standards for US studies and had an unclear to high risk of bias. 
Meta-analysis of five comparative studies showed no evidence of clinically 
significant bias between US and direct measurements (very low certainty), and 
between US and CBCT (very low certainty) for soft-tissue thickness. Likewise, 
for bone thickness, there is no evidence of clinically significant bias between 
US and CBCT (low certainty).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the CBCT and direct measurements, ultrasonography might 
be a reliable approach for monitoring on periodontal and peri-implant phenotype. 
However, there is uncertainty about estimates of the actual effect, so further 
standardized and larger sample size of clinical research is needed.",© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,"DOI: 10.1111/cid.13231

trajectories until 6 months postpartum on infants' socioemotional development 
(SED) at age 12 months, and (b) the mediating role of maternal self-efficacy 
(MSE), and the additional effect of postpartum anxiety at age 12 months.
METHODS: We used data from POST-UP trial (n = 1843). PPD was assessed using the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 1, 3, and 6 months. Infants' SED 
was assessed at 12 months using the Ages and Stages 
Questionnaire-Social-Emotional (ASQ-SE). Structural equations were applied to 
estimate the effect of PPD trajectories on infants' SED and mediation by MSE. 
The additional effects of postpartum anxiety were assessed with conditional 
regression.
RESULTS: Higher levels of PPD over time were associated with a lower SED 
(coefficient for log-EPDS 3.5, 95% confidence interval 2.8; 4.2, e.g., an 
increase in the EPDS score from 9 to 13 worsens the ASQ-SE by 1.3 points). About 
half of this relationship was mediated by MSE. Postpartum anxiety had an 
independent adverse effect on SED.
CONCLUSIONS: PPD and postpartum anxiety have a negative impact on infants' SED. 
MSE as a mediator may be a potential target for preventive interventions to 
alleviate the negative effects of maternal psychopathology on infants' SED.
IMPACT: The trajectories of postpartum depression (PPD) from 1 month to 6 months 
were negatively related to infants' socioemotional development (SED) at age 12 
months, underlining the importance of repeated assessment of PPD. Maternal 
self-efficacy (MSE) mediated the association between PPD and SED, implying MSE 
could be a potential target for preventive interventions. An additional 
independent negative effect of postpartum anxiety was identified, implying the 
assessment of postpartum anxiety also has a surplus value to identify mothers at 
risk.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric

(#)Contributed equally","IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a progressive form of kidney disease defined by 
glomerular deposition of IgA. Here we performed a genome-wide association study 
of 10,146 kidney-biopsy-diagnosed IgAN cases and 28,751 controls across 17 
international cohorts. We defined 30 genome-wide significant risk loci 
explaining 11% of disease risk. A total of 16 loci were new, including 
TNFSF4/TNFSF18, REL, CD28, PF4V1, LY86, LYN, ANXA3, TNFSF8/TNFSF15, REEP3, 
ZMIZ1, OVOL1/RELA, ETS1, IGH, IRF8, TNFRSF13B and FCAR. The risk loci were 
enriched in gene orthologs causing abnormal IgA levels when genetically 
manipulated in mice. We also observed a positive genetic correlation between 
IgAN and serum IgA levels. High polygenic score for IgAN was associated with 
earlier onset of kidney failure. In a comprehensive functional annotation 
analysis of candidate causal genes, we observed convergence of biological 
candidates on a common set of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine 
ligand-receptor pairs, prioritizing potential new drug targets.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","DOI: 10.1038/s41588-023-01422-x

effects on hippocampal traits across ancestries, although ancestry-specific 
associations exist. Cross-ancestry analysis improves the fine-mapping precision 
and the prediction performance of polygenic scores in under-represented

inhibitors (TKIs), especially in the absence of kinase domain mutations in 
BCR-ABL1, is poorly understood. Through deep molecular profiling, we uncovered 
three transcriptomic subtypes of BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukemia, each 
representing a maturation arrest at a stage of B-cell progenitor 
differentiation. An earlier arrest was associated with lineage promiscuity, 
treatment refractoriness and poor patient outcomes. A later arrest was 
associated with lineage fidelity, durable leukemia remissions and improved 
patient outcomes. Each maturation arrest was marked by specific genomic events 
that control different transition points in B-cell development. Interestingly, 
these events were absent in BCR-ABL1+ preleukemic stem cells isolated from 
patients regardless of subtype, which supports that transcriptomic phenotypes 
are determined downstream of the leukemia-initialing event. Overall, our data 
indicate that treatment response and TKI efficacy are unexpected outcomes of the 
differentiation stage at which this leukemia transforms.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41588-023-01429-4

Here, we describe a macrophage population present during lactation in mice. By

lactation-induced CD11c+CX3CR1+Dectin-1+ macrophage population (liMac) that was 
distinct from the two resident F4/80hi and F4/80lo macrophage subsets present 
pregestationally. LiMacs were predominantly monocyte-derived and expanded by 
proliferation in situ concomitant with nursing. LiMacs developed independently 
of IL-34, but required CSF-1 signaling and were partly microbiota-dependent. 
Locally, they resided adjacent to the basal cells of the alveoli and 
extravasated into the milk. We found several macrophage subsets in human milk 
that resembled liMacs. Collectively, these findings reveal the emergence of 
unique macrophages in the mammary gland and milk during lactation.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41590-023-01530-0

trained on large-scale bi-parametric MRI data, in detecting clinically 
significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in external multi-center data from men of 
diverse demographics; to investigate the advantages of transfer learning.
METHODS: We used two samples: (i) Publicly available multi-center and 
multi-vendor Prostate Imaging: Cancer AI (PI-CAI) training data, consisting of 
1500 bi-parametric MRI scans, along with its unseen validation and testing 
samples; (ii) In-house multi-center testing and transfer learning data, 
comprising 1036 and 200 bi-parametric MRI scans. We trained a self-adapting 3D 
nnU-Net model using probabilistic prostate masks on the PI-CAI data and 
evaluated its performance on the hidden validation and testing samples and the 
in-house data with and without transfer learning. We used the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate patient-level 
performance in detecting csPCa.
RESULTS: The PI-CAI training data had 425 scans with csPCa, while the in-house 
testing and fine-tuning data had 288 and 50 scans with csPCa, respectively. The 
nnU-Net model achieved an AUROC of 0.888 and 0.889 on the hidden validation and 
testing data. The model performed with an AUROC of 0.886 on the in-house testing 
data, with a slight decrease in performance to 0.870 using transfer learning.
CONCLUSIONS: The state-of-the-art deep learning method using prostate masks 
trained on large-scale bi-parametric MRI data provides high performance in 
detecting csPCa in internal and external testing data with different 
characteristics, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of deep 
learning within and across datasets.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: A self-adapting deep network, utilizing prostate 
masks and trained on large-scale bi-parametric MRI data, is effective in 
accurately detecting clinically significant prostate cancer across diverse 
datasets, highlighting the potential of deep learning methods for improving 
prostate cancer detection in clinical practice.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1186/s13244-023-01439-0

prevalence of hypertension. We aimed to investigate the longitudinal association 
between dietary patterns and hypertension in Chinese adults over 28 years of 
follow-up. We used data collected in the China Health and Nutrition Survey from 
1991 to 2018. Adults aged 18 years and above (n = 15,929) were included in the 
analysis, for whom questionnaires and anthropometric data were collected during 
at least two waves. Factor analysis was conducted to derive food patterns based 
on 18 foods or food groups. We constructed three-level mixed-effect linear 
regression models to estimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) in relation to quartiles of dietary pattern score and performed 
three-level mixed-effect logistic regression models to assess the risk of 
hypertension. Participants in the top quartile of the modern pattern had a 
decrease in SBP (β = - 0.51; 95% CI -0.86, -0.16; P < 0.01) when adjusted for 
all potential confounders, whereas participants in the top quartile of the meat

Participants in the highest quartile of the meat pattern were more likely to 
have hypertension (OR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.03, 1.24; P < 0.01). Adherence to the

inversely associated with SBP, whereas the meat pattern was positively

2,205,199 individuals were included. Here we show that, in the general 
population, both social isolation and loneliness were significantly associated 
with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (pooled effect size for social 
isolation, 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26 to 1.39; P < 0.001; pooled 
effect size for loneliness, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.20; P < 0.001) and cancer 
mortality (pooled effect size for social isolation, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.28; 
P < 0.001; pooled effect size for loneliness, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.17; 
P = 0.030). Social isolation also increased the risk of CVD mortality (1.34; 95% 
CI, 1.25 to 1.44; P < 0.001). There was an increased risk of all-cause mortality 
in socially isolated individuals with CVD (1.28; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.48; 
P = 0.001) or breast cancer (1.51; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.70; P < 0.001), and 
individuals with breast cancer had a higher cancer-specific mortality owing to 
social isolation (1.33; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.75; P = 0.038). Greater focus on 
social isolation and loneliness may help improve people's well-being and 
mortality risk.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41562-023-01617-6

released from the liver. FGF21 acts on FGF21 receptors (FGFRs) and β-Klotho, 
which is a transmembrane co-receptor. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
inflammatory disorders stimulate the release of FGF21 to overcome insulin 
resistance (IR). FGF21 improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. 
Metformin which is used in the management of T2DM may increase FGF21 expression. 
Accordingly, the objective of this review was to clarify the metformin effect on 
FGF21 in T2DM. FGF21 level and expression of FGF2Rs are dysregulated in T2DM due 
to the development of FGF21 resistance. Metformin stimulates the hepatic 
expression of FGF21/FGF2Rs by different signaling pathways. Besides, metformin 
improves the expression of β-Klotho which improves FGF21 sensitivity. In 
conclusion, metformin advances FGF21 signaling and decreases FGF21 resistance in 
T2DM, and this might be an innovative mechanism for metformin in the enhancement 
of glucose homeostasis and metabolic disorders in T2DM patients.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland

associated with liver cirrhosis. However, plasma AVP remains elevated despite 
progressive hypoosmolality. This study investigated changes to inhibitory 
control of supraoptic nucleus (SON) AVP neurons during liver cirrhosis. 
Experiments were conducted with adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Bile duct 
ligation was used as a model of chronic liver cirrhosis. An adeno-associated 
virus containing a construct with an AVP promoter and either green fluorescent 
protein (GFP) or a ratiometric chloride indicator, ClopHensorN, was bilaterally 
injected into the SON of rats. After 2 weeks, rats received either BDL or sham 
surgery, and liver cirrhosis was allowed to develop for 4 weeks. In vitro, loose 
patch recordings of action potentials were obtained from GFP-labeled and 
unlabeled SON neurons in response to a brief focal application of the GABAA 
agonist muscimol (100 μM). Changes to intracellular chloride ([Cl]i) following 
muscimol application were determined by changes to the fluorescence ratio of 
ClopHensorN. The contribution of cation chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 
to changes in intracellular chloride was investigated using their respective 
antagonists, bumetanide (BU, 10 μM) and VU0240551 (10 μM). Plasma osmolality and 
hematocrit were measured as a marker of dilutional hyponatremia. The results 
showed reduced or absent GABAA -mediated inhibition in a greater proportion of 
AVP neurons from BDL rats as compared to sham rats (100% inhibition in sham vs. 
47% in BDL, p = .001). Muscimol application was associated with increased [Cl]i 
in most cells from BDL as compared to cells from sham rats (χ2  = 30.24, 
p < .001). NKCC1 contributed to the impaired inhibition observed in BDL rats 
(p < .001 BDL - BU vs. BDL + BU). The results show that impaired inhibition of 
SON AVP neurons and increased intracellular chloride contribute to the sustained 
dilutional hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis.","© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Neuroendocrinology published by John Wiley & Sons

(#)Contributed equally","Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is defined by a degeneration of the 
anterior horn cells resulting in muscle weakness predominantly in the proximal 
lower limbs. While most patients carry a biallelic deletion in the SMN1 gene 
(localized in chromosome 5q), little is known regarding patients without 
SMN1-mutation, and a genetic diagnosis is not always possible. Here, we report a 
cohort of 24 French patients with non-5q proximal SMA from five neuromuscular 
centers who all, except two, had next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel, 
followed by whole exome sequencing (WES) if gene panel showed a negative result. 
The two remaining patients benefited directly from WES or whole genome 
sequencing (WGS). A total of ten patients with causative variants were 
identified, nine of whom were index cases (9/23 families = 39%). Eight variants 
were identified by gene panel: five variants in DYNC1H1, and three in BICD2. 
Compound heterozygous causative variants in ASAH1 were identified directly by 
WES, and one variant in DYNC1H1 was identified directly by WGS. No causative 
variant was found using WES in patients with a previous panel with negative 
results (14 cases). We thus recommend using primarily NGS panels in patients 
with non-5q-SMA and using WES, especially when several members of the same 
family are affected and/or when trio analyses are possible, or WGS as

the skin and the nervous system. The condition is completely penetrant with 
extreme clinical variability, resulting in unpredictable manifestations in 
affected offspring, complicating reproductive decision-making. One of the 
reproductive options to prevent the birth of affected offspring is 
preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). We performed a retrospective review of 
the medical files of all couples (n = 140) referred to the Dutch PGT expert 
center with the indication NF1 between January 1997 and January 2020. Of the 
couples considering PGT, 43 opted out and 15 were not eligible because of 
failure to identify the underlying genetic defect or unmet criteria for in vitro 
fertilization (IVF) treatment. The remaining 82 couples proceeded with PGT. 
Fertility assessment prior to IVF treatment showed a higher percentage of male 
infertility in males affected with NF1 compared to the partners of affected 
females. Cardiac evaluations in women with NF1 showed no contraindications for 
IVF treatment or pregnancy. For 67 couples, 143 PGT cycles were performed. 
Complications of IVF treatment were not more prevalent in affected females 
compared to partners of affected males. The transfer of 174 (out of 295) 
unaffected embryos led to 42 ongoing pregnancies with a pregnancy rate of 24.1% 
per embryo transfer. There are no documented cases of misdiagnosis following PGT 
in this cohort. With these results, we aim to provide an overview of PGT for NF1 
with regard to success rate and safety, to optimize reproductive counseling and

(CBD) are available on the commercial market. One of the most common products, 
CBD oil, is administered to self-treat a variety of conditions. These oils are 
available as CBD isolate, broad-spectrum [all terpenes and minor cannabinoids 
except Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)], or full-spectrum (all terpenes and minor 
cannabinoids with THC < 0.3% dried weight) products. A systematic 
pharmacokinetic study was performed to determine whether there are differences 
in the pharmacokinetic parameters and systemic exposure of CBD after oral dosing 
as an isolate, broad-spectrum, or full-spectrum product.
METHODS: Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were treated with a single, 
equivalent oral dose of CBD delivered as isolate, broad-spectrum, or 
full-spectrum product. An additional study using an in-house preparation of CBD 
isolate plus 0.2% THC was performed. A permeability assay was also conducted to 
investigate whether the presence of THC alters the intestinal permeability of 
CBD.
RESULTS: There was an increase in the oral bioavailability of CBD (12% and 21% 
in male and female rats, respectively) when administered as a full-spectrum 
product compared with the isolate and broad-spectrum products. There was no 
difference in the bioavailability of CBD between the commercially available 
full-spectrum formulation (3.1% CBD; containing 0.2% THC plus terpenes and other 
minor cannabinoids) versus the in-house preparation of CBD full-spectrum (CBD 
isolate 3.2% plus 0.2% THC isolate). In vitro permeability assays demonstrated 
that the presence of THC increases permeability of CBD while also decreasing 
efflux through the gut wall.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 0.2% THC increased the oral bioavailability of CBD 
in male and female rats, indicating that full-spectrum products may produce 
increased effectiveness of CBD due to a greater exposure available systemically.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland

gradients that captured distinct dimensions of cingulate hierarchical 
organization. The principal gradient exhibited a radiating organization with 
transitions from the middle toward both anterior and posterior parts of the 
cingulate cortex and was related to canonical functional networks and 
corresponding behavioral domains. The second gradient showed an 
anterior-posterior axis across the cingulate cortex and had prominent geometric 
distance dependence. The third gradient displayed a marked differentiation of 
subgenual and caudal middle with other parts of the cingulate cortex and was

addition, few studies have investigated reward anticipation in healthy humans

outcomes following liver surgery. The impact of enhanced recovery programmes on 
medium- and long-term outcomes is incompletely understood. This study aimed to 
assess the impact of an enhanced recovery programme on long-term survival in 
patients undergoing surgery for colorectal liver metastases.
METHODS: At a tertiary hepatobiliary centre, we analysed short-, medium- and 
long-term outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing liver resection for 
colorectal liver metastases. A five-year retrospective review was carried out 
comparing the enhanced recovery programme to standard care.
RESULTS: A total of 172 patients were included in the analysis: 87 on standard 
care and 85 on an enhanced recovery programme. Open surgery was performed in 122 
patients: 74 (85.1%) and 48 (56.5%) patients in the standard care and enhanced 
recovery programme, respectively (p < 0.001). There was a significant reduction 
in the median (IQR) length of hospital stay in the enhanced recovery programme 
compared with standard care (7 (5) days vs. 8 (3) days, p = 0.0009). There was 
no significant difference in survival between standard care and the Enhanced 
Recovery Programme at one (p = 0.818), three (p = 0.203), and five years 
(p = 0.247).
CONCLUSION: An enhanced recovery programme was associated with a reduced length 
of hospital stay. There was no effect on the one-, three- and five-year 
survival.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00423-023-02968-4

the immune component of the tumor microenvironment also substantially impacts 
tumor behavior and complicates treatment response, particularly to 
immunotherapies. Although the standard method for characterizing tumor immune 
profile is through performing integrated genomic analysis on tissue biopsies, 
the dynamic change in the immune composition of the tumor microenvironment makes 
this approach not feasible, especially for brain tumors. Radiomics is a rapidly 
growing field that uses advanced imaging techniques and computational algorithms 
to extract numerous quantitative features from medical images. Recent advances 
in machine learning methods are facilitating biological validation of radiomic 
signatures and allowing them to ""mine"" for a variety of significant correlates, 
including genetic, immunologic, and histologic data. Radiomics has the potential 
to be used as a non-invasive approach to predict the presence and density of 
immune cells within the microenvironment, as well as to assess the expression of 
immune-related genes and pathways. This information can be essential for patient 
stratification, informing treatment decisions and predicting patients' response 
to immunotherapies. This is particularly important for tumors with difficult 
surgical access such as gliomas. In this review, we provide an overview of the

necessary for the polymerase to engage in RNA synthesis initiation and to 
transition into an elongation mode. Competition studies reveal that the MRK-1 
binding pocket is distinct from that of a capping inhibitor with an overlapping 
resistance profile, suggesting that the polymerase conformation bound by MRK-1 
may be distinct from that involved in mRNA capping. These findings should 
facilitate optimization of dual RSV and HMPV replication inhibitors and provide 
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their polymerase activities.","© 2023. Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA and its affiliates.","DOI: 10.1038/s42003-023-04990-0

increase with population aging, the combined effect of frailty and FoF on 
incident disability is not yet well understood.
AIMS: The purpose of this study is to examine whether frailty combined with FoF 
increased the risk of incident disability in older adults. Our secondary purpose 
was to clarify the synergistic effect of frailty and FoF on incident disability.
METHODS: This is a prospective study. Participants were 9372 older adults (mean 
age 73.5 years). Frailty status was assessed using the Japanese Cardiovascular 
Health Study index, and FoF was measured using two closed questions. Incident 
disability was prospectively monitored by their long-term care insurance 
records.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period (mean duration 23.4 months), 487 (5.2%) 
participants developed disability. The proportion of incident disability 
linearly increased according to FoF level regardless of baseline frailty status. 
Frail participants with FoF had a higher risk of incident disability than those 
with frailty only or neither (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.63, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.95-3.54). Frailty in combination with excessive FoF further 
increased the risk of incident disability (adjusted HR 4.30, 95% CI 2.56-7.23) 
although no synergistic effect was observed (relative excessive risk due to 
interaction 1.69, 95% CI - 0.55, 3.93).
CONCLUSION: The overlapping status of frailty and FoF, especially excessive FoF, 
increases the risk of incident disability in older adults.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland

associated with prostate cancer (PCa) progression in high-risk PCa patients 
treated primarily with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and extended 
pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) in a tertiary referral center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a period ranging from January 2013 to October 2020, 
RARP and ePLND were performed on 180 high-risk patients at Azienda Ospedaliera 
Universitaria Integrata of Verona (Italy). PCa progression was defined as 
biochemical recurrence/persistence and/or local recurrence and/or distant 
metastases. Statistical methods evaluated study endpoints, including Cox's 
proportional hazards, Kaplan-Meyer survival curves, and binomial logistic 
regression models.
RESULTS: The median age of included patients was 66.5 [62-71] years. Disease 
progression occurred in 55 patients (30.6%), who were more likely to have 
advanced age, palpable tumors, and unfavorable pathologic features, including 
high tumor grade, stage, and pelvic lymph node invasion (PLNI). On multivariate 
analysis, PCa progression was predicted by advanced age (≥ 70 years) 
(HR = 2.183; 95% CI = 1.089-4377, p = 0.028), palpable tumors (HR = 3.113; 95% 
CI = 1.499-6.465), p = 0.002), and PLNI (HR = 2.945; 95% CI = 1.441-6.018, 
p = 0.003), which were associated with clinical standard factors defining 
high-risk PCa. Age had a negative prognostic impact on elderly patients, who 
were less likely to have palpable tumors but more likely to have high-grade 
tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: High-risk PCa progression was independently predicted by advanced 
age, palpable tumors, and PLNI, which is associated with standard clinical 
prognostic factors. Consequently, with increasing age, the prognosis is worse in 
elderly patients, who represent an unfavorable age group that needs extensive 
counseling for appropriate and personalized management decisions.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s40520-023-02466-z

METHODS: We evaluated serum zonulin levels in patients with late-onset AD 
(LOAD), vascular dementia (VAD), MIXED (AD + VAD) dementia, amnestic MCI, and in 
healthy controls.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, serum zonulin increased in LOAD, MIXED

tibial bone structural and functional properties in male C57BL/6J mice. Mice 
were randomized into one of two experimental groups: VML-injured mice that were 
injured at age 12 weeks and aged to 20 weeks (8-weeks post-injury, VML) and 
20-week old age-matched uninjured mice (Uninjured-20). Tibial bone strength, 
mid-diaphysis cortical geometry, intrinsic material properties, and metaphyseal 
trabecular bone structure were assessed by three-point bending and 
micro-computed tomography (µCT). The plantar flexor muscle group (gastrocnemius, 
soleus, plantaris) was analyzed for its functional capacities, i.e., 
peak-isometric torque and peak-isokinetic power. VML-injured limbs had 25% less 
peak-isometric torque and 31% less peak-isokinetic power compared to those of 
Uninjured-20 mice (p<0.001). Ultimate load, but not stiffness, was significantly 
less (10%) in tibias of VML-injured limbs compared to those from Uninjured-20 
(p=0.014). µCT analyses showed cortical bone thickness was 6% less in tibias of 
VML-injured limbs compared to Uninjured-20 (p=0.001). Importantly, tibial bone 
cross-section moment of inertia, the primary determinant of bone ultimate load, 
was 16% smaller in bones of VML-injured limbs compared to bones from 
Uninjured-20 (p=0.046). Metaphyseal trabecular bone structure was also altered 
up to 23% in tibias of VML-injured limbs (p<0.010). These changes in tibial bone 
structure and function after a VML injury occur during a natural maturation 
phase between the age of 12 and 20 weeks, as evidenced by Uninjured-20 mice 
having greater tibial bone size and strength compared to uninjured aged 12-week

has been widely observed in crystalline solids under mechanical loading. 
However, the goal of manipulating dislocation motion via a non-mechanical field 
alone remains elusive. Here we present real-time observations of dislocation 
motion controlled solely by using an external electric field in 
single-crystalline zinc sulfide-the dislocations can move back and forth 
depending on the direction of the electric field. We reveal the 
non-stoichiometric nature of dislocation cores and determine their charge 
characteristics. Both negatively and positively charged dislocations are 
directly resolved, and their glide barriers decrease under an electric field, 
explaining the experimental observations. This study provides direct evidence of 
dislocation dynamics controlled by a non-mechanical stimulus and opens up the 
possibility of modulating dislocation-related properties.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41563-023-01572-7

(#)Contributed equally","Two-dimensional conjugated polymers (2DCPs), composed of multiple strands of 
linear conjugated polymers with extended in-plane π-conjugation, are emerging 
crystalline semiconducting polymers for organic (opto)electronics. They are 
represented by two-dimensional π-conjugated covalent organic frameworks, which 
typically suffer from poor π-conjugation and thus low charge carrier mobilities. 
Here we overcome this limitation by demonstrating two semiconducting 
phthalocyanine-based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)-ladder-type 2DCPs 
(2DCP-MPc, with M = Cu or Ni), which are constructed from 
octaaminophthalocyaninato metal(II) and naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride 
by polycondensation under solvothermal conditions. The 2DCP-MPcs exhibit optical 
bandgaps of ~1.3 eV with highly delocalized π-electrons. Density functional 
theory calculations unveil strongly dispersive energy bands with small 
electron-hole reduced effective masses of ~0.15m0 for the layer-stacked 
2DCP-MPcs. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals the band transport of Drude-type free 
carriers in 2DCP-MPcs with exceptionally high sum mobility of electrons and 
holes of ~970 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room temperature, surpassing that of the reported 
linear conjugated polymers and 2DCPs. This work highlights the critical role of 
effective conjugation in enhancing the charge transport properties of 2DCPs and 
the great potential of high-mobility 2DCPs for future (opto)electronics.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41563-023-01581-6

opportunity to search for atmospheres on small planets outside the Solar 
System1. Thanks to the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), 
possible atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are now 
detectable2,3. Recent JWST observations of the innermost planet TRAPPIST-1 b 
showed that it is most probably a bare rock without any CO2 in its atmosphere4. 
Here we report the detection of thermal emission from the dayside of 
TRAPPIST-1 c with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST at 15 µm. We 
measure a planet-to-star flux ratio of fp/f⁎ = 421 ± 94 parts per million (ppm), 
which corresponds to an inferred dayside brightness temperature of 380 ± 31 K. 
This high dayside temperature disfavours a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on the 
planet. The data rule out cloud-free O2/CO2 mixtures with surface pressures 
ranging from 10 bar (with 10 ppm CO2) to 0.1 bar (pure CO2). A Venus-analogue 
atmosphere with sulfuric acid clouds is also disfavoured at 2.6σ confidence. 
Thinner atmospheres or bare-rock surfaces are consistent with our measured 
planet-to-star flux ratio. The absence of a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on 
TRAPPIST-1 c suggests a relatively volatile-poor formation history, with less 
than [Formula: see text] Earth oceans of water. If all planets in the system 
formed in the same way, this would indicate a limited reservoir of volatiles for 
the potentially habitable planets in the system.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-06232-z

(#)Contributed equally","OBJECTIVE: A SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.5.2) epidemic began in China in December, 
2022 following stopping the zero COVID policy.
METHODS: We studied features of the epidemic in 1,121 persons with chronic 
myeloid leukaemia (CML).
RESULTS: 1103 (98%) were in chronic, 10 in accelerated and 8 in acute phases. 
834 (74%) became infected almost all of whom met criteria for COVID-19. The most 
common symptoms were fever (91%), cough (90%) and fatigue (82%). 42 infected 
persons were asymptomatic. Most people quarantined at home and self-medicated. 
22 were hospitalized for COVID-19. At admission 5 had mild, 14, moderate and 3, 
severe/critical disease according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. 5 
received respiratory assistance, 3 were admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) and 1 in accelerated phase died from COVID-19. Co-variates associated with 
a risk of COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects include age ≥ 65 years, 
higher education level and imatinib therapy.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, most SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5.2 infections in persons 
with CML resulted in COVID-19 most of which cases are mild with only 1 death.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,

adapted cattle in Brazil. This study aimed to compare the growth, slaughter, and 
carcass traits as well as meat quality of two local breeds (Curraleiro Pé-Duro 
and Pantaneiro) with the Nelore breed. Fifteen 30-month-old steers of each breed 
were weighted (Curraleiro Pé-Duro = 264.80 kg; Nelore = 346.80 kg; Pantaneiro = 
316.20 kg) and raised in a feedlot condition for 112 days, with measurements to 
assess growth and slaughter, visual and carcass and meat traits. Data were 
submitted to variance and multivariate analyses. Nelore and Curraleiro Pé-Duro 
had similar Gluteus medius depths. Pantaneiro and Curraleiro Pé-Duro were 
superior for leg compactness index (P < 0.05) and had higher eye muscle area 
than Nelore (P < 0.05). Although there was no difference in daily weight gain 
and slaughter weight between breeds, Curraleiro Pé-Duro had a lower initial 
weight (264.80 kg) when compared to Nelore (346.80 kg; P < 0.05). Nelore and 
Curraleiro Pé-Duro deposited more fat than Pantaneiro (P < 0.05), while 
Curraleiro Pé-Duro and Pantaneiro had more muscle than Nelore (P < 0.05), which 
also had more bone and a higher percentage of second-quality cuts (P < 0.05). 
Meat from Nelore also showed lower succulence than Pantaneiro (P < 0.05) and 
higher shear force than the other breeds (P < 0.05). Pantaneiro's meat had the 
most capacity to retain water (P < 0.05), lower shear force (P < 0.05), and was 
more succulent (P < 0.05) when compared to the other breeds. Multivariate 
analysis showed that Pantaneiro, Curraleiro Pé-Duro, and Nelore breeds can be 
considered distinct in growth, carcass, and meat traits, with the local breeds 
showing superior meat traits. The local breeds Curraleiro Pé-Duro and Pantaneiro 
presented characteristics similar or better to those of the Nelore, proving to 
be animals with great productive potential and generate high meat quality under 
feedlot conditions.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","DOI: 10.1007/s11250-023-03656-7

day-night light ratio. The light/dark cycle regulates animal learning, memory, 
and mood swings. A study was conducted to examine the effect of different 
quantity and quality of light at night on the daily clock, learning, memory, 
cognition, and expression of transcripts in key learning centers. Treatment was 
similar for experiments one to three. Rats were exposed for 30 days to 12 h 
light and 12 h dark with a night light of 2 lx (dLAN group), 250 lx (LL), or 
without night light (LD). In experiment one, after 28 days, blood samples were 
collected and 2 days later, animals were exposed to constant darkness. In 
experiment two, after 30 days of treatment, animals were subjected to various 
tests involving learning, memory, and cognition. In experiment three, after 
30 days of treatment, animals were sampled, and transcript levels of 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tyrosine kinase, Growth-Associated Protein 
43, Neurogranin, microRNA-132, cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein, Glycogen 
synthase kinase-3β, and Tumor necrosis factor α were measured in hippocampus, 
thalamus, and cortex tissues. In experiment four, animals were exposed to night 
light of 0.019 W/m2 but of either red (640 nm), green (540 nm), or blue (450 nm) 
wavelength for 30 days, and similar tests were performed as mentioned in 
experiment 2. While in experiment five, after 30 days of respective wavelength 
treatments, all animals were sampled for gene expression studies. Our results 
show that exposure to dLAN and LL affects the daily clock as reflected by 
altered melatonin secretion and locomotor activity, compromises the learning, 
memory, and cognitive ability, and alterations in the expression levels of 
transcripts in the hypothalamus, cortex, and thalamus. The effect is night light 
intensity dependent. Further, blue light at night has less drastic effects than 
green and red light. These results could be of the potential use of framing the 
policies for the use of light at night.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Photochemistry

across the industry have remained aspirational and elusive despite strong 
interest in adopting patient-centric approaches. One factor contributing to this 
inertia stems from a lack of standardized implementation of patient engagement 
activities, which varies widely from company to company, making it difficult to 
track and measure. Further, empirical evidence mapping the impact of patient 
engagement capabilities on clinical research outcomes has remained sparse. To 
address this gap, the Drug Information Association (DIA) and Tufts Center for 
the Study of Drug Development (Tufts CSDD) at the Tufts University School of 
Medicine developed and administered an assessment tool that companies can use to 
not only evaluate their organization's patient engagement capabilities and 
implementation preparedness but can also measure the impact of such activities 
on trial outcomes. Results showed that while most organizations are providing 
logistical support to increase patient engagement in the form of travel 
stipends, accommodation, and financial incentives, most are not implementing 
more involved forms of patient engagement such as gathering patient input 
through patient input panels or patient steering committees. This paper 
discusses the process for designing and administering this assessment tool, the 
results of the assessment, and future implications.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Drug Information

colorectal cancer (mCRC) to the liver treated with transarterial 
chemoembolization with HepaSphere™ Microspheres 30-60 μm loaded with irinotecan 
(ΙRI-HEP-TACE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study (NCT04866290), 100 adults with 
confirmed mCRC to the liver who were ineligible for resection were enrolled and 
followed up to 24 months or death. Study outcomes among Salvage (patients not 
tolerating more cycles of chemotherapy) and Non-salvage patients included 
overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (OR), 
objective response rate (ORR), best tumor response (BTR), adverse events (AEs), 
and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its active metabolite, 
7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38).
RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (range: 31-89). Median OS was 15.08 months 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.33-17.25). PFS was 8.52 months (95% CI: 
6.0-9.0; p < 0.001). ORR was 42.2% (95% CI: 31.57-53.50) and 35.9% (95% CI: 
25.57-47.62) based on modified RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. BTR was not significantly different between 
mRECIST and RECIST (p = 0.745). The Non-salvage group had a statistically 
significant difference in median OS relative to the Salvage group (15.3 vs. 
3 months; p < 0.001). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated no correlation of OS 
with plasma concentration of irinotecan and SN38 (all p > 0.05). Most AEs were 
Grade 2 (257/279), the most common AE was right upper abdominal pain (180/279). 
One major AE (tumor rupture) was reported.
CONCLUSION: IRI-HEP-TACE is an alternative treatment for patients with 
Non-salvage mCRC to the liver.","© 2023. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the

stochastic processes influence the selection of translocating molecule, 
translocation rate and translocation velocity. As a result, single-molecule 
translocations are challenging to control both spatially and temporally. Here we 
present a method using a glass nanopore mounted on a three-dimensional 
nanopositioner to spatially select molecules, deterministically tethered on a 
glass surface, for controlled translocations. By controlling the distance 
between the nanopore and glass surface, we can actively select the region of 
interest on the molecule and scan it a controlled number of times and at a 
controlled velocity. Decreasing the velocity and averaging thousands of 
consecutive readings of the same molecule increases the signal-to-noise ratio by 
two orders of magnitude compared with free translocations. We demonstrate the 
method's versatility by assessing DNA-protein complexes, DNA rulers and DNA 
gaps, achieving down to single-nucleotide gap detection.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41565-023-01412-4

technique that is free of secondary toxic byproducts, calls for the fabrication 
of a nature-friendly adsorbent with a robust capacity to decontaminate polluted 
water sources and be recycled. To this end, we report the fabrication of novel 
nanocomposite (KMCM) from microcline (KMC) and multiwall carbon nanotubes 
(MWCNTs). The adsorbents (KMC and KMCM) were characterized using XRD, BET, SEM, 
TGA and FTIR. The novel and low-cost nano sorbent were designed for the 
elimination of tartrazine (Tatz) from wastewater. The adsorption of Tatz onto 
KMC and KMCM was influenced by adsorbent dose, initial Tatz concentration, 
contact time and solution pH. Experimental data acquired from the equilibrium 
studies were well addressed by the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum uptake 
capacity of 37.96 mg g-1 and 67.17 mg g-1 were estimated for KMC and KMCM. The 
kinetics for the adsorption of Tatz onto KMC and KMCM was best expressed by 
pseudo-second-order and Elovich models. The thermodynamic parameters revealed 
that the uptake of Tatz onto KMC and KMCM was an endothermic (ΔH: 
KMC = 35.0 kJ mol-1 and KMCM = 42.91 kJ mol-1), entropy-driven (ΔS: 
KMC = 177.6 J K-1 mol-1 and KMCM = 214.2 J K-1 mol-1) and spontaneous process.

prospective patients. Evidence from social media posts by the UK and Dutch 
cosmetic clinics illustrates the precarious balance between professionalism and 
commercialism, and raises important questions for the regulation of these 
marketing communication efforts.
METHODS: A random selection of Instagram posts by Dutch and the UK clinics which 
offer (non-) invasive cosmetic procedures were selected for a qualitative 
content analysis. The corpus of data comprised 395 posts by six Dutch and four 
UK clinics, published between January 2018 and July 2019. The method of analysis 
was inspired by previous qualitative studies into the marketing of cosmetic 
procedures and can be described as a (discursive) thematic analysis.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The tension between the medical-professional and 
commercial nature of cosmetic procedures was evident in the Instagram posts by 
Dutch and UK clinics. Despite calls for 'ethical' marketing on social media, 
this study illustrates that marketing materials are not always in line with 
current advertising guidelines. Whereas advertising standards authorities have 
warned against the trivialization of cosmetic procedures, posts by clinics 
backgrounded the medical nature of procedures in favor of more commercial 
advertising appeals. Furthermore, the posts demonstrated little diversity in 
terms of models' gender, ethnicity and body type, which reinforces narrow 
contemporary beauty ideals.

surgery results, and many techniques are used for this purpose. Thus, the aim of 
the present study was to compare 3 breast volume techniques: Pessoa's single 
marking technique, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Crisalix 3D software®.
METHODS: Fourteen patients indicated for mammoplasty were selected. Three breast 
volume measurement techniques were compared: Pessoa's single marking technique, 
MRI and Crisalix 3D software®. The volumes were tabulated and analyzed using R 
software.
RESULTS: Average age was 30.93 ± 10.25 years. The breast volume was 1554.54 ± 
512.54 cm3, as measured by the MRI technique (considered the gold standard), 
1199.64 ± 403.13 cm3 using Crisalix 3D software® and 1518.04 ± 468.72 cm3 by 
Pessoa's single marking technique. Comparison between the Crisalix 3D software® 
and MRI techniques using the pairwise t test demonstrated a statistically 
significant difference (t = 4.3957, df = 27, p value = 0001543), but no 
significant difference between the single marking and MRI techniques (t = 
1.3841, df = 27, p value = 0.1777).
CONCLUSION: When compared to MRI, breast volume measurement using Pessoa's 
single marking technique showed no statistically significant difference between 
them. However, the Crisalix 3D® technique exhibited a difference in relation to 
MRI. Anthropometric measurements are useful in measuring breast volume because 
they are easy to obtain, practical and inexpensive, and should be part of a 
plastic surgeon's arsenal.

(#)Contributed equally","Anxiety and fear are dysfunctional behaviors commonly observed in domesticated 
dogs. Although dogs and humans share psychopathological similarities, little is 
known about how dysfunctional fear behaviors are represented in brain networks 
in dogs diagnosed with anxiety disorders. A combination of diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) and graph theory was used to investigate the underlying structural 
connections of dysfunctional anxiety in anxious dogs and compared with healthy 
dogs with normal behavior. The degree of anxiety was assessed using the Canine 
Behavioral Assessment & Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), a widely used, 
validated questionnaire for abnormal behaviors in dogs. Anxious dogs showed 
significantly decreased clustering coefficient ([Formula: see text]), decreased 
global efficiency ([Formula: see text]), and increased small-worldness (σ) when 
compared with healthy dogs. The nodal parameters that differed between the 
anxious dogs and healthy dogs were mainly located in the posterior part of the 
brain, including the occipital lobe, posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, 
mesencephalon, and cerebellum. Furthermore, the nodal degree ([Formula: see 
text]) of the left cerebellum was significantly negatively correlated with 
""excitability"" in the C-BARQ of anxious dogs. These findings could contribute to 
the understanding of a disrupted brain structural connectome underlying the

used for low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detection in space. However, 
exposure to energetic particles in the environment can lead to electrostatic 
charging of the TM, resulting in additional electrostatic and Lorentz forces 
that can impact GW detection sensitivity. To evaluate this effect, the 
high-energy proton data set of the Geostationary Operational Environmental 
Satellite (GOES) program was used to analyze TM charging due to Solar Proton 
Events (SPEs) in the 24th solar cycle. Using the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit, the 
TM charging process is simulated in a space environment for SPEs falling into 
three ranges of proton flux: (1) greater than 10 pfu and less than 100 pfu, (2) 
greater than 100 pfu and less than 1000 pfu, and (3) greater than 1000 pfu. It 
is found that SPEs charging can reach the threshold within 535 s to 18.6 h, 
considering a reasonable discharge threshold of LISA and Taiji. We demonstrate 
that while there is a somewhat linear correlation between the net charging rate 
of the TM and the integrated flux of [Formula: see text] 10 MeV SPEs, there are 
many cases in which the integrated flux is significantly different from the 
charging rate. Therefore, we investigate the difference between the integral 
flux and the charging rate of SPEs using the charging efficiency assessment 
method. Our results indicate that the energy spectrum structure of SPEs is the 
most important factor influencing the charging rate. Lastly, we evaluate the 
charging probability of SPEs in the 24th solar cycle and find that the frequency 
and charging risk of SPEs are highest in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th years, 
which can serve as a reference for future GW detection spacecraft.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-37005-3

driving type-2 inflammation during C. neoformans infection. Nevertheless, the 
impact of these cytokines in regulating host T helper cell response during C. 
neoformans infection is still unclear. We observed that C. neoformans infection 
promoted a predominant increase of T helper cells that co-expressed IL-25 and 
IL-33 receptors within the lung during the late infection phase. A comparative 
transcriptomic analysis of effector T helper cells co-treated with IL-25 and

expression. Without IL-25 receptor signaling, IL-33 treatment upregulated 
Th1-associated genes and genes associated with nucleotide metabolism. By

transmitted mainly through exposure to airborne respiratory droplets and 
aerosols carrying the virus.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the transport and dispersion of respiratory aerosols 
containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other viruses in a small office space using 
a diffusion-based computational modeling approach.
METHODS: A 3-D computational model was used to simulate the airflow inside the 
70.2 m3 ventilated office. A novel diffusion model accounting for turbulence 
dispersion and gravitational sedimentation was utilized to predict droplet 
concentration transport and deposition. The numerical model was validated and 
used to investigate the influences of partition height and different ventilation 
rates on the concentration of respiratory aerosols of various sizes (1, 10, 20, 
and 50 µm) emitted by continuous speaking.
RESULTS: An increase in the hourly air change rate (ACH) from 2.0 to 5.6 
decreased the 1 μm droplet concentration inside the office by a factor of 2.8 
and in the breathing zone of the receptor occupant by a factor of 3.2. The 
concentration at the receptor breathing zone is estimated by the area-weighted 
average of a 1 m diameter circular disk, with its centroid at the center of the 
receptor mannequin mouth. While all aerosols were dispersed by airflow 
turbulence, the gravitational sedimentation significantly influenced the 
transport of larger aerosols in the room. The 1 and 10 μm aerosols remained 
suspended in the air and dispersed throughout the room. In contrast, the larger 
20 and 50 μm aerosols deposited on the floor quickly due to the gravitational 
sedimentation. Increasing the partition between cubicles by 0.254 m (10"") has 
little effect on the smaller aerosols and overall exposure.
IMPACT: This paper provides an efficient computational model for analyzing the 
concentration of different respiratory droplets and aerosols in an indoor 
environment. Thus, the approach could be used for assessing the influence of the 
spatial concentration variations on exposure for which the fully mixed model 
cannot be used.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","DOI: 10.1038/s41370-023-00546-w

linked to lower vaccine-induced antibody concentrations in children, while data 
from adults remains limited and equivocal. Characteristics of PFAS exposure and 
age at vaccination may modify such effects.
OBJECTIVE: We used the mass administration of novel COVID-19 vaccines to test 
the hypothesis that prior exposure to environmentally-relevant concentrations of 
PFAS affect antibody response to vaccines in adolescents and adults.
METHODS: Between April and June 2021, 226 participants aged 12-90 years with a 
history of exposure to PFAS in drinking water and who received an mRNA COVID-19 
vaccine participated in our prospective cohort study. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and 
anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (IgG) were quantified before the first and second 
vaccine doses and again at two follow-ups in the following months (up to 103 
days post dose 1). Serum PFAS concentrations (n = 39 individual PFAS) were 
measured once for each participant during baseline, before their first 
vaccination. The association between PFAS exposure and immune response to 
vaccination was investigated using linear regression and generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) models with adjustment for covariates that affect antibody 
response. PFAS mixture effects were assessed using weighted quantile sum and 
Bayesian kernel machine regression methods.
RESULTS: The geometric mean (standard deviation) of perfluorooctane sulfonate 
and perfluorooctanoic acid serum concentrations in this population was 10.49 
(3.22) and 3.90 (4.90) µg/L, respectively. PFAS concentrations were not 
associated with peak anti-spike antibody response, the initial increase in 
anti-spike antibody response following vaccination, or the waning over time of 
the anti-spike antibody response. Neither individual PFAS concentrations nor 
their evaluation as a mixture was associated with antibody response to mRNA 
vaccination against COVID-19.
IMPACT STATEMENT: Given the importance of understanding vaccine response among 
populations exposed to environmental contaminants and the current gaps in 
understanding this relationship outside of early life/childhood vaccinations, 
our manuscript contributes meaningful data from an adolescent and adult 
population receiving a novel vaccination.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41370-023-00564-8

host against metabolic disorders. Because it is genetically intractable, the 
mechanisms underlying mucin metabolism, gut colonization and its impact on host 
physiology are not well understood. Here we developed and applied transposon 
mutagenesis to identify genes important for intestinal colonization and for the 
use of mucin. An analysis of transposon mutants indicated that de novo 
biosynthesis of amino acids was required for A. muciniphila growth on mucin 
medium and that many glycoside hydrolases are redundant. We observed that mucin 
degradation products accumulate in internal compartments within bacteria in a 
process that requires genes encoding pili and a periplasmic protein complex, 
which we term mucin utilization locus (MUL) genes. We determined that MUL genes 
were required for intestinal colonization in mice but only when competing with 
other microbes. In germ-free mice, MUL genes were required for A. muciniphila to 
repress genes important for cholesterol biosynthesis in the colon. Our genetic 
system for A. muciniphila provides an important tool with which to uncover 
molecular links between the metabolism of mucins, regulation of lipid 
homeostasis and potential probiotic activities.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41564-023-01407-w

oxidant/antioxidant responses against Saprolegnia parasitica (S. parasitica) 
infection in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Three groups of Nile tilapia 
were assigned as the control group (no zoospores exposure). The other two groups 
were challenged by Saprolegnia zoospores; one was used for sampling, and the 
other for mortality monitoring. The study lasted 3 weeks and was sampled at 
three point times at 1, 2, and 3 weeks. Results showed that S. parasitica 
zoospores were pathogenic to Nile tilapia, causing a cumulative mortality rate 
of 86.6%. Immunoglobulin M and C- reactive protein (IgM and CRP) levels showed a 
similar trend being significantly (P < 0.05, P < 0.001) higher in the infected 
group at weeks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, compared to the control group. Oxidant 
and antioxidant parameters in gills revealed that Malondialdehyde (MDA) level 
was significantly higher in the infected group compared to the control group. 
While catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase (CAT, GSH, and 
SOD) levels were significantly decreased in the infected group compared to the 
control group. Compared to the control, the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) gene 
was firmly upregulated in gill tissue at all-time points, particularly at day 14 
post-infection. Meanwhile, Interleukin 1-β (IL-1 β) gene was significantly 
upregulated only at days 7 and 14 post-infection compared to control. 
Histopathological examination revealed destructive and degenerative changes in 
both skin and gills of experimentally infected Nile tilapia. Our findings 
suggest that Nile tilapia-S. parasitica infection model was successful in better 
understanding of pathogenicity and host (fish)-pathogen (oomycete) interactions,

knowledge and understanding of MPs in snow remain sparse. This study 
investigates the abundance, composition, size (> 30 µm), and shape of MPs in 
snow specimens from various nature preservation areas and also from urban sites 
in Hokkaido. Various polymeric-type MPs with mostly fragmentary shapes were 
detected among the specimens. More than half of MPs were in the smallest size 
class (30-60 µm), implying the presence of more MPs below the limit (< 30 µm). 
Concentrations of MPs ranged from 1.5 × 102 to 4.2 × 103 particles/L. The 
results demonstrated that microplastic abundance generally decreases 
concomitantly with increasing remoteness of sampling sites. Observed features of 
MPs at different locations and their relation to geographical settings have 
indicated that the ubiquitously observed fine particles (mainly alkyd, 
ethylene-vinyl acetate, and polyethylene) are attributable to long-distance 
atmospheric transportation, whereas the rubber and larger particles especially

ruptures in near-surface regions on the Yangsan Fault, Korea, based on 
multi-scale structural observations. Paleoearthquake ruptures occur mostly along 
the boundary between the inherited fault core and damage zone 
(N10-20°E/> 75°SE). The ruptures propagated upward to the shallow subsurface 
along a < 3-cm-wide specific slip zone with dextral-slip sense, along which the 
deformation mechanism is characterized mainly by granular flow in near-surface 
region. The ruptures either reach the surface or are terminated in 
unconsolidated sediment below the surface. In the latter case, the rupture 
splays show westward bifurcation, and their geometry and kinematics show a 
change to NNW-strike with low-angle dip and dextral-reverse oblique-slip sense 
in the strata. We suggest that the upward termination of the contractional 
strike-slip ruptures is controlled by the inherited fault geometry that is 
unfavorable with respect to the stress field (ENE-WSW σHmax) at basement depths 
in terms of movement on the fault, and the lack of extension of the fault into 
shallow subsurface; a depth-dependent change in stress from σHmax > σv > σHmin 
to σHmax > σHmin > σv at depth of a ~ 200 m; and the physical properties of

ship. The performance of the fuel cell varies during operation, so a power 
allocation strategy considering fuel cell performance differences is proposed, 
which consists of two layers. In the first layer, the maximum power and maximum 
efficiency of each fuel cell system (FCS) are updated in real-time with an 
online parameter identification model, which is composed of the fuel cell 
semi-empirical model and adaptive Kalman filter. The second layer takes the 
state of charge of the battery energy storage system, the maximum power, and the 
maximum efficiency as inputs for power allocation. Compared with the equal 
allocation strategy and daisy chain strategy, the total hydrogen consumption 
reduces by 5.3% and 15.1% and the total output power of the FCS with poor 
performance reduces by 14.1% and 15.7%. The results show that the proposed 
method can improve the efficiency of the ship power system and reduce the 
operational burden of the FCS with poor performance.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-37076-2

sites of chronic inflammation and recognized as prognosticators in several 
cancers. We aimed to analyse the prognostic effect of TLSs in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) pulmonary metastases and primary tumours, with a comparison to the CD3+ 
and CD8+ cell density-based immune cell score (ICS). For TLS density and TLS 
maximum diameter analysis, 67 pulmonary metastases and 63 primary tumours were 
stained with haematoxylin and eosin. For ICS scoring and analysis, CD3 and CD8 
immunohistochemistry was performed. Excellent interobserver agreement was 
achieved in all TLS measurements. Of all patients, 36 patients had low TLS 
density (< 0.222 follicles/mm) and 31 patients had high TLS density (≥ 0.222 
follicles/mm) in the first resected pulmonary metastases. TLS density (adjusted 
HR 0.91, 0.48-1.73) or maximum diameter (adjusted HR 0.78, 0.40-1.51) did not 
have prognostic value in pulmonary metastases. In primary tumours, higher TLS 
density (adjusted HR 0.39, 0.18-0.87) and maximum diameter (adjusted HR 0.28, 
0.11-0.73) were associated with lower mortality. In the pulmonary metastases, 
ICS had superior prognostic value to TLSs; however, TLSs and ICS were 
significantly associated. In conclusion, TLSs in CRC pulmonary metastases had no

lead to a decrease in trust in them. However, it is possible, for robots to 
repair a human's trust in them after they have made mistakes through various 
trust repair strategies such as apologies, denials, and promises. Presently, the 
efficacy of these trust repairs in the human-robot interaction literature has 
been mixed. One reason for this might be that humans have different perceptions 
of a robot's mind. For example, some repairs may be more effective when humans 
believe that robots are capable of experiencing emotion. Likewise, other repairs 
might be more effective when humans believe robots possess intentionality. A key 
element that determines these beliefs is mind perception. Therefore 
understanding how mind perception impacts trust repair may be vital to 
understanding trust repair in human-robot interaction. To investigate this, we 
conducted a study involving 400 participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical 
Turk to determine whether mind perception influenced the effectiveness of three 
distinct repair strategies. The study employed an online platform where the 
robot and participant worked in a warehouse to pick and load 10 boxes. The robot 
made three mistakes over the course of the task and employed either a promise, 
denial, or apology after each mistake. Participants then rated their trust in 
the robot before and after it made the mistake. Results of this study indicated 
that overall, individual differences in mind perception are vital considerations 
when seeking to implement effective apologies and denials between humans and 
robots.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-37032-0

inflammation, and insulin resistance. The role of long noncoding RNA 
(lncRNA)-regulated pyroptosis in NAFLD development remains largely unknown. This 
study aimed to investigate whether NAFLD development is controlled by lncRNA 
growth-arrest specific transcript 5 (GAS5)/miR-28a-5p/membrane associated 
ring-CH-type finger 7 (MARCH7)-mediated pyroptosis using in vivo and in vitro 
models. First, GAS5 expression was decreased but miR-28a-5p expression was 
increased in the livers of NAFLD patients, high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and 
leptin-deficient obese (Ob/Ob) mice. Furthermore, GAS5 suppressed while 
miR-28a-5p promoted NAFLD development, and overexpression of miR-28a-5p reversed 
the GAS5 overexpression-induced attenuation of NAFLD. Mechanistically, GAS5 
served as a sponge of miR-28a-5p, and miR-28a-5p enhanced pyroptosis by 
targeting the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the E3 ligase MARCH7 during NAFLD 
development. MARCH7 interacted with the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) 
protein, resulting in proteasomal degradation of NLRP3 to inhibit pyroptosis. As 
expected, MARCH7 knockdown abolished the miR-28a-5p knockdown-induced inhibition 
of NAFLD development, and the ubiquitin E3 ligase-inactive mutant (W589A/I556A) 
of MARCH7 failed to inhibit NAFLD development. In conclusion, GAS5 protected 
against NAFLD development by binding to miR-28a-5p, miR-28a-5p promoted NAFLD 
development by targeting MARCH7, and MARCH7 ameliorated NAFLD by suppressing 
NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis. The GAS5/miR-28a-5p/MARCH7/NLRP3 axis plays an 
important role in NAFLD progression, and it might be a biomarker for NAFLD.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to ADMC Associazione

post original injury of 6 mm diameter) under treatment with observable 
microscopic benefits. We then expand upon these findings with minimal dose 
threshold estimation of 1 μg HoxA3 plasmid delivered topically at a weekly 
interval. Furthermore, we observed similarities in natural wound healing rates 
between aged non-diabetic mice and young diabetic mice, which provided 
motivation to test topical HoxA3 plasmid in aged non-diabetic mice. We observed 
that HoxA3 treatment achieved complete wound closure (0 mm diameter) at 2 weeks 
whereas untreated wounds were only 50% closed (3 mm wound diameter). We did not 
observe any gross adverse effects macroscopically or via histology in these

(#)Contributed equally","Dissecting and understanding the cancer ecosystem, especially that around the 
tumor margins, which have strong implications for tumor cell infiltration and 
invasion, are essential for exploring the mechanisms of tumor metastasis and 
developing effective new treatments. Using a novel tumor border scanning and 
digitization model enabled by nanoscale resolution-SpaTial Enhanced REsolution 
Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we identified a 500 µm-wide zone centered around 
the tumor border in patients with liver cancer, referred to as ""the invasive 
zone"". We detected strong immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming, and 
severely damaged hepatocytes in this zone. We also identified a subpopulation of 
damaged hepatocytes with increased expression of serum amyloid A1 and A2 
(referred to collectively as SAAs) located close to the border on the paratumor 
side. Overexpression of CXCL6 in adjacent malignant cells could induce 
activation of the JAK-STAT3 pathway in nearby hepatocytes, which subsequently 
caused SAAs' overexpression in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, overexpression 
and secretion of SAAs by hepatocytes in the invasive zone could lead to the 
recruitment of macrophages and M2 polarization, further promoting local 
immunosuppression, potentially resulting in tumor progression. Clinical 
association analysis in additional five independent cohorts of patients with 
primary and secondary liver cancer (n = 423) showed that patients with 
overexpression of SAAs in the invasive zone had a worse prognosis. Further in 
vivo experiments using mouse liver tumor models in situ confirmed that the 
knockdown of genes encoding SAAs in hepatocytes decreased macrophage 
accumulation around the tumor border and delayed tumor growth. The 
identification and characterization of a novel invasive zone in human cancer 
patients not only add an important layer of understanding regarding the 
mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis, but may also pave the way for 
developing novel therapeutic strategies for advanced liver cancer and other 
solid tumors.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41422-023-00831-1

and may aid discrimination from healthy ageing. However, it remains unclear 
which assessments to use. This study aimed to explore what methods have been 
used and to describe associations between upper limb function and cognitive 
impairment. A scoping review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL and Web of 
Science. A systematic search was undertaken, including synonyms for key concepts 
'upper limb', 'motor function' and 'cognitive impairment'. Selection criteria 
included tests of upper limb motor function and impaired cognition in adults. 
Analysis was by narrative synthesis. Sixty papers published between 1998 and 
2022, comprising 41,800 participants, were included. The most common assessment 
tasks were finger tapping, Purdue Pegboard Test and functional tasks such as 
writing. Protocols were diverse in terms of equipment used and recording 
duration. Most participants were recruited from clinical settings. Alzheimer's 
Disease was the most common cause of cognitive impairment. Results were mixed 
but, generally, slower speed, more errors, and greater variability in upper limb 
movement variables was associated with cognitive impairment. This review maps 
the upper limb motor function assessments used and summarises the available 
evidence on how these associate with cognitive impairment. It identifies 
research gaps and may help guide protocols for future research. There is

growing attention for its ability to modulate various aspects of normal and 
malignant cellular physiology. Recent research has revealed that PON2 is 
upregulated in tissues from patients with various types of solid tumors and 
hematologic cancers, likely due to its ability to suppress oxidative stress and 
evade apoptosis. However, the effects of PON2 on pulmonary oncogenesis are 
unknown. Here, we conducted studies to investigate how PON2 influences lung 
cancer cell proliferation in vitro and lung tumorigenesis in vivo using a 
variety of cellular and animal models. It was found that PON2 expression 
deficiency hampered the proliferation of cultured lung cancer cells with 
concomitant cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. In addition, the loss of 
endogenous PON2 expression impaired key aspects of oxidative metabolism in lung 
adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, we investigated how the interplay between PON2 
expression in lung tumors and host mice influences lung tumor initiation and 
progression. PON2 status in both transplanted tumor cells and mice failed to 
influence the development of subcutaneously grafted Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) 
tumors, orthotopically implanted LLC tumors, and oncogenic Kras-driven primary 
lung adenocarcinoma tumors. Importantly, the frequencies of tumor-infiltrating 
myeloid subsets that include myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and 
tumor-associated macrophages were not impacted by PON2 expression in LLC 
tumor-bearing mice. Overall, our studies indicate that PON2 plays a limited role 
in murine lung tumorigenesis.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-37146-5

historically been associated with blindness from overgrowth of blood vessels 
from the retina into the vitreous that lead to complex retinal detachments. Our 
understanding of ROP has evolved with the survival of extremely low-birthweight 
infants and includes not only overgrowth of blood vessels, but also insufficient 
developmental retinal vascular growth in early phases of the disease. Our 
current treatments of ROP have focused on methods to improve perinatal and 
prenatal care, reduce premature birth, and prevent early phases of ROP. 
Nonetheless, addressing vasoproliferation in treatment-warranted eyes remains 
the mainstay of management. Two main treatment strategies co-exist today: laser 
treatment, which has been the standard of care since the 1990s, and anti-VEGF

accurate operation of sensitive equipment particularly for nuclear 
installations. Assessment of PQ involves collecting and analysing data resources 
and then evaluating it with reference to PQ standards. There are many 
alternatives for PQ and it is difficult to make an appropriate selection among 
them in the existence of their multiple criteria which are usually conflicted. 
So this selection subject can be classified as a Multi Criteria Decision Making 
(MCDM) problem. To do so, a reliable and scientific method for studying and 
evaluating the overall system PQ is required. This study aims to assess 
performance of PQ for the electrical power system at a Nuclear Research Reactor 
(NRR) during a certain period using multiple measures for the most decisive PQ 
phenomena. It focuses on a number of the most important PQ phenomena namely 
frequency fluctuation (deviation), unbalances of current and voltage, current 
and voltage harmonic distortion, flicker and power factor. After combining all 
results into six samples (alternatives), the criteria weights are determined 
based on an objective method for weighting which is called CRITIC method. Then, 
the alternatives are ranked using compromise MCDM method-VIKOR method. The 
obtained results are analyzed and discussed to evaluate performance of NRR 
electrical system from the PQ view. It showed that the compromise solution that 
obtained by CRITIC-VIKOR can be a guide to facilitate the PQ evaluation of 
nuclear installation electrical system. Also, it can empower the operators with 
the benefits of benchmarking and monitoring a single index instead of several 
indices. Moreover, it is very useful for helping stakeholders to understand how 
the PQ performance changes under a certain operating condition of the facility. 
Finally, it is can be considered as a good model to weight each PQ phenomena and 
identify the time intervals for best and worst total PQ in NRR.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36692-2

(1)School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, 
WA, USA. robinw3@uw.edu.","For species with overlapping generations, the most widely used method to 
calculate effective population size (Ne) is Hill's, the key parameter for which 
is lifetime variance in offspring number ([Formula: see text]). Hill's model 
assumes a stable age structure and constant abundance, and sensitivity to those 
assumptions has been evaluated previously. Here I evaluate the robustness of 
Hill's model to extreme patterns of reproductive success, whose effects have not 
been previously examined: (1) very strong reproductive skew; (2) strong temporal 
autocorrelations in individual reproductive success; and (3) strong covariance 
of individual reproduction and survival. Genetic drift (loss of heterozygosity 
and increase in allele frequency variance) was simulated in age-structured 
populations using methods that generated no autocorrelations or covariances 
(Model NoCor); or created strong positive (Model Positive) or strong negative 
(Model Negative) temporal autocorrelations in reproduction and covariances 
between reproduction and survival. Compared to Model NoCor, the other models led 
to greatly elevated or reduced [Formula: see text], and hence greatly reduced or 
elevated Ne, respectively. A new index is introduced (ρα,α+), which is the 
correlation between (1) the number of offspring produced by each individual at 
the age at maturity (α), and (2) the total number of offspring produced during 
the rest of their lifetimes. Mean ρα,α+ was ≈0 under Model NoCor, strongly 
positive under Model Positive, and strongly negative under Model Negative. Even 
under the most extreme reproductive scenarios in Models Positive and Negative, 
when [Formula: see text] was calculated from the realized population pedigree 
and used to calculate Ne in Hill's model, the result accurately predicted the 
rate of genetic drift in simulated populations. These results held for scenarios 
where age-specific reproductive skew was random (variance ≈ mean) and highly 
overdispersed (variance up to 20 times the mean). Collectively, these results 
are good news for researchers as they demonstrate the robustness of Hill's model 
even in extreme reproductive scenarios.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.","DOI: 10.1038/s41437-023-00633-6

academia and industry. It is a major challenge for optimization algorithms to 
generate very accurate solutions in high-dimensional search spaces. However, 
traditional search tools are prone to dimensional catastrophes and local optima, 
thus failing to provide high-precision results. To solve these problems, a novel 
hermit crab optimization algorithm (the HCOA) is introduced in this paper. 
Inspired by the group behaviour of hermit crabs, the HCOA combines the optimal 
search and historical path search to balance the depth and breadth searches. In 
the experimental section of the paper, the HCOA competes with 5 well-known 
metaheuristic algorithms in the CEC2017 benchmark functions, which contain 29 
functions, with 23 of these ranking first. The state of work BPSO-CM is also 
chosen to compare with the HCOA, and the competition shows that the HCOA has a

observing visual representations of datasets. Colormap data visualizations 
(""colormaps"") show patterns in datasets by mapping variations in color to 
variations in magnitude. When people interpret colormaps, they have expectations 
about how colors map to magnitude, and they are better at interpreting 
visualizations that align with those expectations. For example, they infer that 
darker colors map to larger quantities (dark-is-more bias) and colors that are 
higher on vertically oriented legends map to larger quantities (high-is-more 
bias). In previous studies, the notion of quantity was straightforward because 
more of the concept represented (conceptual magnitude) corresponded to larger 
numeric values (numeric magnitude). However, conceptual and numeric magnitude 
can conflict, such as using rank order to quantify health-smaller numbers 
correspond to greater health. Under conflicts, are inferred mappings formed 
based on the numeric level, the conceptual level, or a combination of both? We 
addressed this question across five experiments, spanning data domains: alien 
animals, antibiotic discovery, and public health. Across experiments, the 
high-is-more bias operated at the conceptual level: colormaps were easier to 
interpret when larger conceptual magnitude was represented higher on the legend, 
regardless of numeric magnitude. The dark-is-more bias tended to operate at the 
conceptual level, but numeric magnitude could interfere, or even dominate, if 
conceptual magnitude was less salient. These results elucidate factors 
influencing meanings inferred from visual features and emphasize the need to 
consider data meaning, not just numbers, when designing visualizations aimed to

(#)Contributed equally","Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related 
death. The role of pyroptosis in LUAD remains unclear. Our study aimed to 
identify a prognostic signature of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) and explore 
the connection of PRGs with the tumour microenvironment in LUAD. Gene expression 
and clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. 
Consensus clustering was applied to classify LUAD patients. The least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator Cox and multivariate Cox regression models were 
used to generate a PRG-related prognostic signature. The correlations between 
PRGs and tumour-infiltrating immune cells or the tumour mutational burden were 
analysed by Spearman's correlation analysis. In this study, 44 PRGs 
significantly differed in expression between LUAD and normal tissues. Based on 
these genes, patients were clustered into three clusters with significantly 
different distributions of tumour-infiltrating immune cells and immune 
checkpoint regulators. A total of four PRGs (NLRP1, HMGB1, CYCS, and BAK1) were 
used to construct a prognostic model. Significant correlations were observed 
between these prognostic PRGs and immune cell infiltration or the tumour 
mutational burden. Predictive nomogram results showed that BAK1 could be an 
independent prognostic biomarker in LUAD. Additionally, the expression level of 
BAK1 was validated in two independent Gene Expression Omnibus cohorts. Our 
identified prognostic PRG signature may provide insight for future studies 
targeting pyroptosis and the tumour microenvironment in LUAD. Future studies are

saliency map for the PST stimuli and found that salient but task-irrelevant 
parts of pictures could evoke intrusion errors. In Experiment 2, we demonstrated 
that longer gazing time at target areas results in a higher probability of

significantly worsen their prognosis. Prospective studies validating intravenous 
thrombolysis (IVT) safety profile in patients with acute ischemic stroke and 
active cancer are still lacking. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate IVT's efficacy 
and safety profile in acute ischemic stroke patients with comorbid active 
cancer. We included in a meta-analysis all relevant published studies, including 
patients with acute ischemic stroke with or without active cancer and receiving 
IVT, according to recommendations for IVT treatment for acute ischemic stroke. 
The primary outcomes were: any intracerebral hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, 
and good functional outcome reported as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2 at the 
end of the scheduled follow-up period. We included 11 studies in the 
meta-analysis. IVT was not associated with a significant increase in the 
incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (OR 1.35; 95% CI 0.85-2.14; I2 76%), nor 
with a significant increase in death for any cause (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.91-1.75; 
I2 71%); furthermore, IVT did not influence mRS between cancer and non-active 
cancer stroke patients (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.35-1.49; I2 59%). IVT seems safe and 
effective in patients with ischemic stroke and concomitant cancer. Due to the 
low overall quality of the evidence, high-quality randomized controlled trials 
with adequate sample sizes are needed.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Medicina

reducing nitrate pollutants and a potential technology for low-temperature and 
low-pressure ammonia synthesis. However, the process is limited by multiple 
competing reactions and NO3- adsorption on cathode surfaces. Here, we report a 
Fe/Cu diatomic catalyst on holey nitrogen-doped graphene which exhibits high 
catalytic activities and selectivity for ammonia production. The catalyst 
enables a maximum ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 92.51% (-0.3 V(RHE)) and a high 
NH3 yield rate of 1.08 mmol h-1 mg-1 (at - 0.5 V(RHE)). Computational and 
theoretical analysis reveals that a relatively strong interaction between NO3- 
and Fe/Cu promotes the adsorption and discharge of NO3- anions. Nitrogen-oxygen 
bonds are also shown to be weakened due to the existence of hetero-atomic dual 
sites which lowers the overall reaction barriers. The dual-site and hetero-atom 
strategy in this work provides a flexible design for further catalyst

underrecognized survival predictor in multiple cardiovascular disease entities. 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic 
value of CHS in patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: The study included patients with available laboratory parameters of 
hepatic function who underwent TAVR from July 2013 until December 2019 at our 
center. CHS was defined as an elevation of at least two of three laboratory 
cholestasis parameters above the upper limit of normal (bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase). Study endpoints were three-year 
survival, technical and device failure (VARC 3), as well as New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional class at follow-up.
RESULTS: Among a total of 953 analyzed patients (47.6% females, median age 80.0 
[76.0-85.0] years) CHS was present in 212 patients (22.4%). In patients with vs. 
without CHS, rates of technical (6.1% vs. 8.4%, p = 0.29) and device failure 
(18.9% vs. 17.3%, p = 0.59) were comparable. NYHA functional class at baseline 
and follow-up was more severe in patients with CHS. Nevertheless, heart failure 
symptoms improved from baseline to follow-up irrespective of hepatic function. 
Three-year survival rates were significantly lower in patients with CHS (49.4 
vs. 65.4%, p < 0.001). The predictive value of CHS persisted after adjustment in 
a multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 1.58, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TAVR, CHS is prevalent in 22% of patients and 
is associated with increased postinterventional mortality. Thus, CHS should be 
included in the decision-making process within the TAVR heart team.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Parenteral anticoagulation is recommended for all patients 
presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during 
primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Whether upstream 
anticoagulation improves clinical outcomes is not well established. We conducted 
a systematic review and meta-analysis of contemporary evidence on parenteral 
anticoagulation timing for STEMI patients.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, 
CENTRAL, and Scopus) until December 2022. Studies were eligible if they (a) 
compared upstream anticoagulation with administration at the catheterization 
laboratory and (b) enrolled patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI. Efficacy 
outcomes included in-hospital or 30-day mortality, in-hospital cardiogenic shock 
(CS), and TIMI flow grade pre- and post-PPCI. Safety outcome was defined as 
in-hospital or 30-day major bleeding.
RESULTS: Overall, seven studies were included (all observational), with a total 
of 69,403 patients. Upstream anticoagulation was associated with a significant 
reduction in the incidence of in-hospital or 30-day all-cause mortality 
(OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45-0.81; p < 0.001) and in-hospital CS (OR 0.68; 95% CI 
0.58-0.81; p < 0.001) and with an increase in spontaneous reperfusion (pre-PPCI 
TIMI > 0: OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.35-1.57; p < 0.001). Pretreatment was not associated 
with an increase in major bleeding (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.70-1.48; p = 0.930).
CONCLUSIONS: Upstream anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower 
risk of 30-day all-cause mortality, incidence of in-hospital CS, and improved 
reperfusion of the infarct-related artery (IRA). These findings were not 
accompanied by an increased risk of major bleeding, suggesting an overall 
clinical benefit of early anticoagulation in STEMI. These results require 
confirmation in a dedicated randomized clinical trial.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","DOI: 10.1007/s00392-023-02235-y

(#)Contributed equally","Current knowledge regarding how the focus of our attention during face 
processing influences neural responses largely comes from neuroimaging studies 
reporting on regional brain activations. The present study was designed to add 
novel insights to this research by studying how attention can differentially 
impact the way cortical regions interact during emotional face processing. 
High-density electroencephalogram was recorded in a sample of fifty-two healthy 
participants during an emotional face processing task. The task required 
participants to either attend to the expressions (i.e., overt processing) or 
attend to a perceptual distractor, which rendered the expressions 
task-irrelevant (i.e., covert processing). Functional connectivity in the alpha 
band was estimated in source space and modeled using graph theory to quantify 
whole-brain integration and segregation. Results revealed that overt processing 
of facial expressions is linked to reduced cortical segregation and increased 
cortical integration, this latter specifically for negative expressions of fear 
and sadness. Furthermore, we observed increased communication efficiency during 
overt processing of negative expressions between the core and the extended face 
processing systems. Overall, these findings reveal that attention makes the 
interaction among the nodes involved in face processing more efficient, also 
uncovering a connectivity signature of the prioritized processing mechanism of 
negative expressions, that is an increased cross-communication within the nodes 
of the face processing network.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36860-4

prevalence is increasing worldwide. The causes are multifactorial but involve 
biological predisposition towards a specific body-weight set point and defended 
adipose tissue mass converging with an obesogenic environment. Comprehensive 
treatment of paediatric obesity includes lifestyle modification therapy, 
anti-obesity medications (AOMs) and/or metabolic surgery. Lifestyle modification 
therapy used alone produces fairly modest weight loss for most youth with 
obesity. The emergence of new AOMs has changed the landscape of paediatric 
weight management, improving the outlook for youth with obesity. This Review 
briefly highlights obesity development pathways in youth and the role that 
pharmacotherapy can play in counteracting these pathophysiological forces. Here, 
results from adolescent AOM clinical trials published since 2020 are reviewed, 
including the safety, efficacy and tolerability of the newest treatments 
(glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and phentermine-topiramate). The 
importance of a comprehensive and chronic care model, including both lifestyle 
modification and ongoing pharmacotherapy, will be discussed in the context of 
maximizing long-term health outcomes. Finally, insight will be provided into the

necessitate optimization of their use to improve both water use efficiency and 
crop productivity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of irrigation and 
nitrogen fertilization on potato yield, quality and water use efficiency. The 
research included different drip irrigation treatments (100%, 66%, and 33% of 
field capacity) and nitrogen levels: 0 (N0), 100 (N1), 200 (N2), 300 (N3), 400 
(N4) and 500 (N5) kg N ha-1. The results indicated that potato yield and growth 
were more sensitive to irrigation treatment than nitrogen levels. Full 
irrigation with 300 kg N ha-1 produced the highest total tuber yield, while low 
irrigation treatments resulted in significantly lower yields. In contrast, the 
66% field capacity irrigation treatment consistently had the highest water use 
efficiency in both years of the study. Furthermore, the study showed that the 
quality characteristics of the tubers were negatively impacted by full 
irrigation treatments compared to low irrigation. These findings suggest that 
with appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application, potatoes can be produced 
with acceptable yields while conserving water and minimizing nitrogen use. This 
research emphasizes the importance of optimizing inputs to improve water use

Kumaon Himalaya. The 1 Hz Lg Q (Q0) values are computed between different pairs 
of two stations and the observed values are later utilized to calculate the 
lateral variation in the Q0 values by following a back projection algorithm. 
This computation of Q0 values utilizes five regional distance earthquakes having 
moment magnitude (Mw) ≥ 4.0, which lie along the great circle path of the 
transect. Three of the five earthquakes occurred in the Tibetan plateau and the 
and the others occurred to the southwest on the Indian shield and are well

and March 2022. The estimate Qo values range from 63 ± 2 and 203 ± 25, with the 
lowest value in the Lesser Himalaya and the highest across part of the Indo 
Gangetic Plain and Siwalik Himalaya. The Q0 model has low values ∼200 along the 
profile in the Indo Gangetic Plain and the Siwalik Himalaya, and are correlated 
with 2-5 km thick sedimentary layers below the Himalaya and the adjoining 
Indo-Gangetic Plain. We observe two distinctly different Q0 values to the 
northeast in the Lesser Himalaya tectonic unit. The region lying between the 
South Almora Thrust (SAT) and the Berinag Thrust (BT) shows extremely low Q0 
values (∼60) but increases further north towards the Vaikrita Thrust (VT) to 
∼200. The possible explanation for observing such huge variation of the Q0 
values within a single tectonic unit may be the presence of fluid rich ramp 
structures, which introduces crustal heterogeneities and traps the aqueous

North and become ∼166 for station pairs in the Higher Himalaya and Tethys 
Himalaya tectonic units. The low Q0 values observed in this region may be 
correlated with low viscous partial melts in the form of Miocene leucogranite 
plutons, which resulted out of the Indo-Asian collision. The attenuation

ground motions of future earthquakes in the area and can contribute to seismic

of the air quality. Non-linear data-driven approaches based on deep neural 
networks have been increasingly used in such contexts showing significant 
improvements w.r.t. more conventional approaches like regression models and 
mechanistic approaches. While such deep learning models were deemed for a long 
time as black boxes, recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) allow to look 
through the model's decision-making process, providing insights into decisive 
input features responsible for the model's prediction. One XAI technique to 
explain the predictions of neural networks which was proven useful in various 
domains is Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). In this work, we extend the 
LRP technique to a sequence-to-sequence neural network model with GRU layers. 
The explanation heatmaps provided by LRP allow us to identify important 
meteorological and temporal features responsible for the accumulation of four 
major pollutants in the air ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: 
see text], [Formula: see text]), and our findings can be backed up with prior

Ocean, a new method was employed to perform proportional double seismic source 
excitation and synchronously receive signals from the sea surface and the 
seabed. The two seismic sources used for excitation were two sets of gun arrays 
with different energies and dominant frequencies, a G gun array and a Bolt gun 
array. The G gun array consisted of 3 G.II guns with a total capacity of 450 in3 
and a dominant frequency of 20-100 Hz. The Bolt gun array consisted of 4 Bolt 
1500LL air guns with a total capacity of 6000 in3 and a dominant frequency of 
10-40 Hz. The seismic receiving system comprised a 480-channel seismic streamer 
towed from the sea surface and 21 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS). During 
offshore operations, the integrated navigation system produced equidistant 
trigger signals at an interval of 50 m. The trigger signals were distributed to 
the G gun array and Bolt gun array at a ratio of 3:1 after passing through a 
pulse signal proportional distributor. The two sets of gun arrays fired 
alternatingly at a given ratio. The receiving equipment on the sea surface and 
seabed simultaneously received the seismic signals excited by the two sets of 
gun arrays. After targeted data processing, in addition to the seismic profile 
generated by the conventional G gun seismic source, the deep seismic profile 
generated by the Bolt gun seismic source and the survey profile of the 
active-source OBS were obtained simultaneously. The penetration depths of the

(#)Contributed equally","The interaction between the gastric epithelium and immune cells plays key roles 
in H. pylori-associated pathology. Here, we demonstrate a procolonization and 
proinflammatory role of tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like 1 (TINAGL1), a 
newly discovered matricellular protein, in H. pylori infection. Increased 
TINAGL1 production by gastric epithelial cells (GECs) in the infected gastric 
mucosa was synergistically induced by H. pylori and IL-1β via the ERK-SP1 
pathway in a cagA-dependent manner. Elevated human gastric TINAGL1 correlated 
with H. pylori colonization and the severity of gastritis, and mouse TINAGL1 
derived from non-bone marrow-derived cells promoted bacterial colonization and 
inflammation. Importantly, H. pylori colonization and inflammation were 
attenuated in Tinagl1-/- and Tinagl1ΔGEC mice and were increased in mice 
injected with mouse TINAGL1. Mechanistically, TINAGL1 suppressed CCL21 
expression and promoted CCL2 production in GECs by directly binding to integrin 
α5β1 to inhibit ERK and activate the NF-κB pathway, respectively, which not only 
led to decreased gastric influx of moDCs via CCL21-CCR7-dependent migration and, 
as a direct consequence, reduced the bacterial clearance capacity of the H. 
pylori-specific Th1 response, thereby promoting H. pylori colonization, but also 
resulted in increased gastric influx of Ly6Chigh monocytes via 
CCL2-CCR2-dependent migration. In turn, TINAGL1 induced the production of the 
proinflammatory protein S100A11 by Ly6Chigh monocytes, promoting H. 
pylori-associated gastritis. In summary, we identified a model in which TINAGL1 
collectively ensures H. pylori persistence and promotes gastritis.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to CSI and USTC.","DOI: 10.1038/s41423-023-01055-4

theory, which overestimates the expected noise based on the ionization 
coefficients reported for this alloy. Even the addition of 'dead space' effects 
cannot account for these discrepancies. The only way to explain the low excess 
noise observed is to conclude that the spatial probability distributions for 
impact ionization of electrons and holes in this material follows a 
Weibull-Fréchet distribution function even at relatively low electric-fields.

important role in the pathophysiology of retinal disease and aging is attributed 
to lipofuscin, a complex of fluorescent metabolites. Fundus autofluorescence 
(AF) imaging allows non-invasive mapping of lipofuscin and is a key technology 
to diagnose and monitor retinal disease. However, currently used 
short-wavelength (SW) excitation light has several limitations, including glare

opacities, limited visualization of the central retina, and potential retinal 
light toxicity. Here, we establish a novel imaging modality which uses red

high-quality, high-contrast fundus images and image interpretation may build on 
clinical experience due to similar appearance of pathology as on SW-AF images. 
Additionally, R-AF images may uncover disease features that previously remained 
undetected. The R-AF signal increases with higher abundance of lipofuscin and 
does not depend on photopigment bleaching or on the amount of macular pigment. 
Improved patient comfort, limited effect of cataract on image quality, and lack

receptors. Therefore, a comprehensive map of receptor organization across 
cortical regions is needed. In this study, we used in vitro receptor 
autoradiography to measure the density of 14 neurotransmitter receptor types in 
109 areas of macaque cortex. We integrated the receptor data with anatomical, 
genetic and functional connectivity data into a common cortical space. We 
uncovered a principal gradient of receptor expression per neuron. This aligns 
with the cortical hierarchy from sensory cortex to higher cognitive areas. A 
second gradient, driven by serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, peaks in the anterior 
cingulate, default mode and salience networks. We found a similar pattern of 
5-HT1A expression in the human brain. Thus, the macaque may be a promising 
translational model of serotonergic processing and disorders. The receptor 
gradients may enable rapid, reliable information processing in sensory cortical 
areas and slow, flexible integration in higher cognitive areas.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41593-023-01351-2

(#)Contributed equally","The role of different cell types and their interactions in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) is a complex and open question. Here, we pursued this question by 
assembling a high-resolution cellular map of the aging frontal cortex using 
single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 24 individuals with a range of 
clinicopathologic characteristics. We used this map to infer the neocortical 
cellular architecture of 638 individuals profiled by bulk RNA sequencing, 
providing the sample size necessary for identifying statistically robust 
associations. We uncovered diverse cell populations associated with AD, 
including a somatostatin inhibitory neuronal subtype and oligodendroglial 
states. We further identified a network of multicellular communities, each 
composed of coordinated subpopulations of neuronal, glial and endothelial cells, 
and we found that two of these communities are altered in AD. Finally, we used 
mediation analyses to prioritize cellular changes that might contribute to 
cognitive decline. Thus, our deconstruction of the aging neocortex provides a 
roadmap for evaluating the cellular microenvironments underlying AD and 
dementia.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","DOI: 10.1038/s41593-023-01356-x

underappreciated owing to poor understanding of its cells and circuits. It was 
assumed that the GPe consisted of a homogeneous neuron population primarily 
serving as a 'relay station' for information flowing through the indirect basal 
ganglia pathway. However, the advent of advanced tools in rodent models has 
sparked a resurgence in interest in the GPe. Here, we review recent data that 
have unveiled the cell and circuit complexity of the GPe. These discoveries have 
revealed that the GPe does not conform to traditional views of the basal 
ganglia. In particular, recent evidence confirms that the afferent and efferent 
connections of the GPe span both the direct and the indirect pathways. 
Furthermore, the GPe displays broad interconnectivity beyond the basal ganglia, 
consistent with its emerging multifaceted roles in both motor and non-motor 
functions. In summary, recent data prompt new proposals for computational rules 
of the basal ganglia.","© 2023. Springer Nature America, Inc.","DOI: 10.1038/s41593-023-01368-7

Clinically relevant placebo effects in nausea have been demonstrated, but it 
remains unclear whether stress has an impact on these effects. The aim of this 
experimental study was to investigate the interplay between acute stress and 
placebo effects in nausea. 80 healthy female volunteers susceptible to motion 
sickness were randomly assigned to either the Maastricht Acute Stress Test or a 
non-stress control condition, and to either placebo treatment or no treatment. 
Nausea was induced by a virtual vection drum and behavioral, psychophysiological 
as well as humoral parameters were repeatedly assessed. Manipulation checks 
confirmed increased cortisol levels and negative emotions in the stressed 
groups. In the non-stressed groups, the placebo intervention improved nausea, 
symptoms of motion sickness, and gastric myoelectrical activity (normo-to-tachy 
(NTT) ratio). In the stressed groups, the beneficial effects of the placebo 
intervention on nausea and motion sickness remained unchanged, whereas no 
improvement of the gastric NTT ratio was observed. Results suggest that placebo 
effects on symptoms of nausea and motion sickness are resistant to 
experimentally-induced stress. Stress most likely interfered with the validity 
of the gastric NTT ratio to measure nausea and thus the gastric placebo effect.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36296-w

future climate change scenarios across the globe and compare their coverage with 
the existing network of marine protected areas. By using species distribution

Regardless of the climate scenario, the potential hotspots of these projected

and the second leading cause of death due to cancer. Early diagnosis of this 
ailment is vital for preventing the tumours to spread and plan treatment to 
possibly eradicate the disease. However, population-wide screening is stunted by 
the requirement of medical professionals to analyse histological slides 
manually. Thus, an automated computer-aided detection (CAD) framework based on 
deep learning is proposed in this research that uses histological slide images 
for predictions. Ensemble learning is a popular strategy for fusing the salient 
properties of several models to make the final predictions. However, such 
frameworks are computationally costly since it requires the training of multiple 
base learners. Instead, in this study, we adopt a snapshot ensemble method, 
wherein, instead of the traditional method of fusing decision scores from the 
snapshots of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, we extract deep 
features from the penultimate layer of the CNN model. Since the deep features 
are extracted from the same CNN model but for different learning environments, 
there may be redundancy in the feature set. To alleviate this, the features are 
fed into Particle Swarm Optimization, a popular meta-heuristic, for 
dimensionality reduction of the feature space and better classification. Upon 
evaluation on a publicly available colorectal cancer histology dataset using a 
five-fold cross-validation scheme, the proposed method obtains a highest 
accuracy of 97.60% and F1-Score of 97.61%, outperforming existing 
state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset. Further, qualitative investigation 
of class activation maps provide visual explainability to medical practitioners, 
as well as justifies the use of the CAD framework in screening of colorectal 
histology. Our source codes are publicly accessible at:

with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: Using UK Biobank data, this study included 18,453 adults with T2D. 
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were determined by the chemiluminescent immunoassay 
method. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios 
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC outcomes.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 8.8 years, there were 284 incident CRC 
cases. Compared with adults with serum 25(OH)D concentrations <25.0 nmol/L, the 
adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for lower to higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations (25.0 to 
<50.0, 50.0 to <75.0, and ≥75.0 nmol/L) were 0.61 (0.46-0.82), 0.50 (0.34-0.74), 
and 0.53 (0.30-0.94), respectively (Ptrend = 0.001). The risk of CRC decreased 
by 19.0% for per 1-SD increment in serum 25(OH)D concentrations. A nonlinear 
association of serum 25(OH)D concentrations with CRC risk was observed using a 
restricted cubic spline analysis (P nonlinearity = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly and 
nonlinearly associated with a lower risk of CRC. These findings highlight the 
potential benefits of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in CRC prevention 
among adults with T2D.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DOI: 10.1038/s41416-023-02323-w

to significantly influence kerogen transformation but the effect of TOS content 
on the evolution of organic porosity has only rarely and indirectly been 
investigated. This study demonstrates that organic porosity is generated at 
lower thermal maturity in mudstones containing Type IIS kerogen relative to 
those with Type II kerogen. To our knowledge this phenomenon has not been 
previously demonstrated. The implications are relevant for the characterization 
of organic-rich mudstones as cap rocks, hydrocarbon reservoirs, and disposal 
reservoirs for CO2 or nuclear waste because pore systems control storage volumes 
and matrix fluid flow. Five thermally immature core samples were selected from 
three organic-rich mudstone units with low to high TOS content: the late 
Devonian Duvernay Formation (Canada), middle late Miocene Onnagawa Formation 
(Japan), and early Jurassic Gordondale member of the Fernie Formation (Canada). 
Hydrous pyrolysis was used to artificially mature splits of the immature samples 
to four maturity stages, upon which petrophysical and organic geochemical 
properties were measured and compared to baseline immature samples. Most 
porosity growth in Type IIS samples occurred below 0.70% VRoeqv, but in Type II

agar plate being held at the inferior orbital rim perpendicular to the face to 
capture airflow from breathing/speaking. Another blood agar plate placed 50 cm 
away from the subject served as an experimental control. A total of 224

(for both practitioners and patients) is the mainstay of reducing bacterial

main pillar of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was very 
effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths. Here, we discuss the 
possibility that mass vaccination might accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution in 
antibody-binding regions compared to natural infection at the population level. 
Using the evidence of strong genetic variation in antibody-binding regions and 
taking advantage of the similarity between the envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2 
and influenza, we assume that immune selection pressure acting on these regions 
of the two viruses is similar. We discuss the consequences of this assumption 
for SARS-CoV-2 evolution in light of mathematical models developed previously 
for influenza. We further outline the implications of this phenomenon, if our

suppress conventional T cells and are essential for immunological tolerance. 
FOXP3, the master transcription factor of Treg cells, controls the expression of 
multiples genes to guide Treg cell differentiation and function. However, only a 
small fraction (<10%) of Treg cell-associated genes are directly bound by FOXP3, 
and FOXP3 alone is insufficient to fully specify the Treg cell programme, 
indicating a role for other accessory transcription factors operating upstream, 
downstream and/or concurrently with FOXP3 to direct Treg cell specification and 
specialized functions. Indeed, the heterogeneity of Treg cells can be at least 
partially attributed to differential expression of transcription factors that 
fine-tune their trafficking, survival and functional properties, some of which 
are niche-specific. In this Review, we discuss the emerging roles of accessory 
transcription factors in controlling Treg cell identity. We specifically focus 
on members of the basic helix-loop-helix family (AHR), basic leucine zipper 
family (BACH2, NFIL3 and BATF), CUT homeobox family (SATB1), zinc-finger domain 
family (BLIMP1, Ikaros and BCL-11B) and interferon regulatory factor family 
(IRF4), as well as lineage-defining transcription factors (T-bet, GATA3, RORγt 
and BCL-6). Understanding the imprinting of Treg cell identity and specialized 
function will be key to unravelling basic mechanisms of autoimmunity and 
identifying novel targets for drug development.","© 2023. This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the

However, RLP30 and RE02 share little sequence similarity and respond to 
different parts of the native/folded protein. Moreover, some Brassicaceae other 
than Arabidopsis also respond to a linear SCP peptide instead of the folded 
protein, suggesting that SCP is an eminent immune target that led to the 
convergent evolution of distinct immune receptors in plants. Surprisingly, RLP30 
shows a second ligand specificity for a SCP-nonhomologous protein secreted by 
bacterial Pseudomonads. RLP30 expression in N. tabacum results in quantitatively 
lower susceptibility to bacterial, fungal and oomycete pathogens, thus

stress on transcriptomic and metabolic responses of berries from two wine grape 
varieties. Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling grapevines were subjected to one of 
four treatments during early fruit ripening: (1) drought stress only, (2) heat 
stress only, (3) simultaneous drought and heat stress, (4) no drought or heat 
stress (control). Berry metabolites, especially organic acids, were analyzed, 
and time-course transcriptome analysis was performed on samples before, during, 
and after the stress episode. Both alone and in conjunction with water stress, 
heat stress had a much more significant impact on berry organic acid content, 
pH, and titratable acidity than water stress. This observation contrasts with 
previous reports for leaves, which responded more strongly to water stress, 
indicating that grape berries display a distinct, organ-specific response to 
environmental stresses. Consistent with the metabolic changes, the global 
transcriptomic analysis revealed that heat stress had a more significant impact 
on gene expression in grape berries than water stress in both varieties. The 
differentially expressed genes were those associated with the tricarboxylic acid 
cycle and glyoxylate cycle, mitochondrial electron transport and alternative

activated carbon and functionalized rC/AC3.7 with EDTA reagent for methylene 
blue (MB) dye removal. The rC/AC3.7 was fabricated by electrospinning cellulose 
acetate (CA) with activated carbon (AC) solution followed by deacetylation. 
FT-IR spectroscopy was applied to prove the chemical structures. In contrast, 
BET, SEM, TGA and DSC analyses were applied to study the fiber diameter and 
structure morphology, the thermal properties and the surface properties of 
rC/AC3.7-EDTA. The CA was successfully deacetylated to give regenerated 
cellulose nanofiber/activated carbon, and then ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
dianhydride was used to functionalize the fabricated nanofiber composite. The 
rC/AC3.7-EDTA, rC/AC5.5-EDTA and rC/AC6.7-EDTA were tested for adsorption of MB 
dye with maximum removal percentages reaching 97.48, 90.44 and 94.17%, 
respectively. The best circumstances for batch absorption experiments of MB dye 
on rC/AC3.7-EDTA were pH 7, an adsorbent dose of 2 g/L, and a starting MB dye 
concentration of 20 mg/L for 180 min of contact time, with a maximum removal 
percentage of 99.14%. The best-fit isotherm models are Temkin and Hasely. The 
outcome of isotherm models illustrates the applicability of the Langmuir 
isotherm model (LIM). The maximal monolayer capacity Qm determined from the 
linear LIM is 60.61 for 0.5 g/L of rC/AC3.7-EDTA. However, based on the results 
from error function studies, the generalized isotherm model has the lowest 
accuracy. The data obtained by the kinetic models' studies exposed that the 
absorption system follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (PSOM) 
throughout the absorption period.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36994-5

by Desmophyllum pertusum and support a diverse community of associated fauna, 
despite hypoxic conditions. In this study, we use carbon and nitrogen stable 
isotope analyses (δ13C and δ15N) to decipher the trophic network of this 
relatively unknown CWC province. Although fresh phytodetritus is available to 
the reef, δ15N signatures indicate that CWCs (12.90 ± 1.00 ‰) sit two trophic 
levels above Suspended Particulate Organic Matter (SPOM) (4.23 ± 1.64 ‰) 
suggesting that CWCs are highly reliant on an intermediate food source, which 
may be zooplankton. Echinoderms and the polychaete Eunice norvegica occupy the 
same trophic guild, with high δ13C signatures (-14.00 ± 1.08 ‰) pointing to a 
predatory feeding behavior on CWCs and sponges, although detrital feeding on 13C 
enriched particles might also be important for this group. Sponges presented the 
highest δ15N values (20.20 ± 1.87 ‰), which could be due to the role of the 
sponge holobiont and bacterial food in driving intense nitrogen cycling 
processes in sponges' tissue, helping to cope with the hypoxic conditions of the 
reef. Our study provides first insights to understand trophic interactions of 
CWC reefs under low-oxygen conditions.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-37035-x

(#)Contributed equally","Carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical nitrogen reduction 
reaction (NRR) have received increasing attention due to their sustainable, 
efficient, and green advantages. However, at present, the research on carbon 
nanotubes (CNTs)-based NRR catalysts is very limited. In this paper, using 
FeN3@(n, 0) CNTs (n = 3 ~ 10) as the representative catalysts, we demonstrate 
that the CNT curvatures will affect the spin polarization of the catalytic 
active centers, the activation of the adsorbed N2 molecules and the Gibbs free 
energy barriers for the formation of the critical intermediates in the NRR 
processes, thus changing the catalytic performance of CNT-based catalysts. 
Zigzag (8, 0) CNT was taken as the optimal substrate, and twenty transition 
metal atoms (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, W, 
Re, Ir, and Pt) were embedded into (8, 0) CNT via N3 group to construct the NRR 
catalysts. Their electrocatalytic performance for NRR were examined using DFT 
calculations, and TcN3@(8, 0) CNT was screened out as the best candidate with a 
low onset potential of - 0.53 V via the distal mechanism, which is superior to 
the molecules- or graphene-support Tc catalysts. Further electronic properties 
analysis shows that the high NRR performance of TcN3@(8, 0) CNT originates from 
the strong d-2π* interaction between the N2 molecule and Tc atom. TcN3@(8, 0) 
CNT also exhibits higher selectivity for NRR than the competing hydrogen 
evolution reaction (HER) process. The present work not only provides a promising 
catalyst for NRR, but also open up opportunities for further exploring of 
low-dimensional carbon-based high efficiency electrochemical NRR catalysts.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36945-0

is evidence that the number of analyzed and affected lymph nodes have prognosis 
value. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are significant 
differences in staging criteria in patients who underwent prostatectomy compared 
to those who did not, and whether the number of affected and analyzed lymph 
nodes (LN) plays a prognostic role. In this retrospective study, a test cohort 
consisting of 404,210 newly diagnosed men with prostate cancer, between 2004 and 
2010, was obtained from the 17 registries (Nov 2021 submission); a validation 
consisting of 147,719 newly diagnosed men with prostate cancer between 2004 and 
2019 was obtained from the 8 registries (Nov 2021 submission). Prostate 
cancer-specific survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves, survival tables 
and Cox regression; overall survival was analyzed only to compare Harrell's 
C-index between different staging criteria. In initial analyses, it was observed 
that the prognostic value of lymph node metastasis changes according to the type 
of staging (clinical or pathological), which is linked to the surgical approach 
(prostatectomy). Compared with T4/N0/M0 patients, which are also classified as 
stage IVA, N1/M0 patients had a shorter [adjusted HR: 1.767 (1429-2184), 
p < 0.0005] and a longer [adjusted HR: 0.832 (0.740-0.935), p = 0.002] specific 
survival when submitted to prostatectomy or not, respectively. Analyzing 
separately the patients who were submitted to prostatectomy and those who were 
not, it was possible to obtain new LN metastasis classifications (N1: 1 + LN; 
N2: 2 + LNs; N3: > 2 + LNs). This new (pathological) classification of N allowed 
the reclassification of patients based on T and Gleason grade groups, mainly 
those with T3 and T4 disease. In the validation group, this new staging 
criterion was proven to be superior [specific survival C-index: 0.908 
(0.906-0.911); overall survival C-index: 0.788 (0.786-0.791)] compared to that 
currently used by the AJCC [8th edition; specific survival C-index: 0.892 
(0.889-0.895); overall survival C-index: 0.744 (0.741-0.747)]. In addition, an 
adequate number of dissected lymph nodes results in a 39% reduction in death 
risk [adjusted HR: 0.610 (0.498-0.747), p < 0.0005]. As main conclusion, the 
surgery has a major impact on prostate cancer staging, mainly modifying the 
effect of N on survival, and enabling the stratification of pathological N 
according to the number of affected LN. Such a factor, when considered as 
staging criteria, improves the prognosis classification.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-37204-y

localized radiation therapy. It is associated with the products of 
tumor-associated gene as autoantibodies (aTAAs) in reaction to the 
tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), with increasing of anti-MAGEA3 and an 
relationship between the abscopal effect and immune response. The hapten 
enhanced local chemotherapy (HELC) was studied to kills tumor and release tumor 
TAAs, then hapten modify the TAAs to neu-TAAs, to produce tumor autologous 
antibodies, called induced tumor-associated autoantibodies (iTAAs) that is 
different from natural TAAs. Since the iTAAs and complement (C) are associated 
with cancer therapy Immunofluorescence (IF) was applied to evaluate the 
expression of the iTAAs and C3, C5, C9. Traces resulted in a partial staining of 
the nucleus in C3's perinuclear reaction. The iTTAs of Survivin, C-MYC, and IMP1 
increased significantly in the tumor cells' intranuclear regions (P = 0.02, 
P = 0.00, P < 0.0001). Koc, zeta, RalA, and p53 had a similar trend in the

we can propose that tumor antigens inside the cancer cells' nuclei are targeted

production of defect-free, high-quality welds during shielded metal arc welding 
of steels. The welding industry has long faced the challenge of the high 
susceptibility of basic electrodes (e.g., E7018) to moisture absorption. In this 
paper, we demonstrate that applying a nanosilica coating to the surface of the 
E7018 electrode-covering using a dip-coating technique can effectively reduce 
the moisture absorption capability of the electrode-covering. The moisture 
measurement results before and after exposure to a moist environment of 80% 
humidity and a temperature of 27 °C for 9 h indicate that the moisture 
absorption values of conventional and nano-treated E7018 electrodes during 
exposure are 0.67 wt% and 0.03 wt%, respectively. While reducing the size of the 
pores on the surface of the electrode-covering can to some extent enhance the 
resistance to moisture absorption, it has been identified that turning the 
wetting behavior of the electrode-covering surface from hydrophilic to 
hydrophobic by the nanosilica coating is the most effective mechanism that 
contributes to the enhanced moisture absorption resistance of the 
nanosilica-treated electrode-covering. The results indicate that this approach 
does not have any deleterious effects on the chemical analysis and tensile 
properties of the weld metal. This simple modification to the electrode-covering 
can be generally applied to a wide range of electrode-covering types to produce

eye perceives different images and stimuli, causing alternating monocular 
dominance. To measure BR, many studies have used two monocular conflicting 
images to induce monocular alternations. Here we chose a group of participants 
with oblique astigmatism (OA) and who produced blur on the orthogonal oblique 
meridian in each eye, resulting in two conflicting images, which may enhance the 
stimulation of monocular alternations. Our results show that OA participants 
tend to have a high rate of BR when viewing natural images, whereas the control

on the impact of researchers' analytic decisions on the results from studies. 
Multiverse analyses involve examining results across a wide array of possible 
analytic decisions (e.g., log-transforming variables, number of covariates, or 
treatment of outliers) and identifying if study results are robust to 
researchers' analytic decisions. Studies have begun to use multiverse analysis 
for well-studied relationships that have some heterogeneity in 
results/conclusions across studies.We examine the well-studied relationship 
between peripheral inflammatory markers (PIMs; e.g., white blood cell count 
(WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP)) and depression severity in the large NHANES 
dataset (n = 25,962). Specification curve analyses tested the impact of 9 common 
analytic decisions (comprising of 58,000+ possible combinations) on the 
association of PIMs and depression severity. Relationships of PIMs and total 
depression severity are robust to analytic decisions (based on tests of 
inference jointly examining effect sizes and p-values). However, moderate/large 
differences are noted in effect sizes based on analytic decisions and the 
majority of analyses do not result in significant findings, with the percentage 
of analyses with statistically significant results being 46.1% for WBC and 43.8% 
for CRP. For associations of PIMs with specific symptoms of depression, some 
associations (e.g., sleep, appetite) in males (but not females) were robust to 
analytic decisions. We discuss how multiverse analyses can be used to guide 
research and also the need for authors, reviewers, and editors to incorporate 
multiverse analyses to enhance replicability of research findings.","© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of

features of arthritis in KD have not been well clarified. We retrospectively 
investigated the characteristics of persistent arthritis beyond the subacute 
phase of KD. In this cohort, 49 of 243 patients (20%) developed arthritis, with 
33 patients (14%) experiencing persistent arthritis. Among these 33 patients, 31 
(94%) had complete KD. Thirty (91%) were resistant to first intravenous 
immunoglobulin, and 15 (45%) required additional infliximab. Five patients (15%) 
developed coronary artery lesions, and 24 (73%) had oligoarthritis, mainly in 
large lower-extremity joints. Twenty-four patients (73%) complained of 
arthralgia. At arthritis onset, 16 patients (48%) presented with fever, 
including recurrent fever in 10 patients. Serum C-reactive protein concentration 
in patients with active arthritis significantly increased compared with after 
acute KD treatment (2.4 vs. 0.7 mg/dL, p < 0.001). Serum matrix 
metalloproteinase-3, a biomarker of arthritis, was significantly higher in 
patients with active arthritis than in remission (93.7 vs. 20.3 ng/mL,

available in nature for the interaction with acoustic, elastodynamic, or 
electromagnetic waves. In Electromagnetics, metasurfaces allow particular 
functionalities to antennas, which in turn lately have been increasingly pushed 
to a multiband operation. To fully exploit metasurfaces' capabilities, the use 
of a metasurface reflector and a metasurface superstrate surrounding a radiating 
element in multiband antennas is interesting. However, such topology generally 
creates multiple reflections inside the formed cavity, known as Fabry-Pérot 
resonances. Here we show that one should tame this phenomenon to use two 
parallel metasurfaces surrounding a planar radiating element. We present the 
conditions to obtain directive, multiband antennas under such circumstances. The 
concepts are validated with a compact device for 5G/4G/Wi-Fi 2.4/5/6E performing 
a beam steering in the 5G without disturbing the radiation patterns of the other 
bands. This device demonstrates that the functionalities of two metasurfaces may 
be exploited in a single design if the presented conditions are respected. We 
also anticipate our work to be a starting point for other studies in the wave 
domain. For example, compact, multiband, beam-steerable microphones or sonar 
transducers with two parallel metasurfaces could be investigated in the future.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36828-4

persons suffering tetraplegia and spinal cord injuries. Intraoral tongue drive 
system (iTDS) is one of the most feasible and non-invasive assistive technology 
(AT), which utilises the transferring and inferring of user intentions through 
different tongue gestures. Wireless transferring is of prime importance and 
requires a suitable design of the intra-oral antenna. In this paper, a compact 
circularly polarized differential intra-oral antenna is designed, and its 
performance is analysed within heterogeneous multilayer mouth and head models. 
It works at 2.4 GHz in the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band. The 
footprint of the differential antenna prototype is 0.271 λg [Formula: see text] 
0.271 λg [Formula: see text] 0.015 λg. It is achieved using two pairs of spiral 
segments loaded in diagonal form near the edges of the central rotated square 
slot and a high dielectric constant substrate. Its spiral-slotted geometry 
further provides the desired swirling and miniaturization at the desired 
frequency band for both mouth scenarios. Additionally, corner triangular slits 
on the radiating patch assist in tuning the axial ratio (< 3 dB) in the desired 
ISM band. To validate the performance of the proposed in-mouth antenna, the 
measurement was carried out using the minced pork and the saline solution for 
closed and opened mouth cases, respectively. The measured - 10 dB impedance 
bandwidth and peak gain values in the minced pork are from 2.28 to 2.53 GHz 
(10.39%) and - 18.17 dBi, respectively, and in the saline solution, are from 2.3 
to 2.54 GHz (9.92%) and - 15.47 dBi, respectively. Further, the specific 
absorption rate (SAR) is estimated, and the data communication link is computed 
with and without a balun loss. This confirms that the proposed differential 
intraoral antenna can establish direct interfacing at the RF front end of the 
intraoral tongue drive system.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36717-w

the local region in the feature maps. Moreover, a pyramids aggregation block is 
applied to combine the two feature pyramids to classify and locate target

relationship between potential sources of physicochemical pollution related to 
the progressing process of eutrophication; and to determine trophic status and 
water quality indices of the selected research object. The analysis 
(Mann-Whitney U test, PCA, HCA, Spearman correlation matrix) showed a high 
susceptibility of the reservoir to eutrophication processes, especially due to 
the influence of dangerous loads of compounds emerging from areas with high 
tourist intensity and pollutants flowing from the Mała Panew River. The 
parameters deteriorating the ecological status were TP, DO, BOD5, and COD. 
Considering the cumulative results of water quality indices for the period 
1998-2020, the average water quality was in classes II or III. A noticeable 
deterioration appeared in water quality for the years 2016-2020, which proves 
the progressing eutrophication in the Turawa reservoir. In 1998-2020, the 
reservoir was classified as eutrophic or mesoeutrophic based on the calculated

we have repurposed the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitrilat as a potent anticancer 
agent using in-silico protein-ligand interaction profiler (PLIP) analysis, 
molecular docking, and in vitro studies. The screening of PLIP profiles between 
vorinostat/panobinostat and HDACs/LTA4H followed by molecular docking resulted 
in five (Sacubitrilat, B65, BDS, BIR, and NPV) FDA-approved, experimental and 
investigational drugs. Sacubitrilat has demonstrated promising anticancer 
activity against colorectal cancer (SW-480) and triple-negative breast cancer 
(MDA-MB-231) cells, with IC50 values of 14.07 μg/mL and 23.02 μg/mL, 
respectively. FACS analysis revealed that sacubitrilat arrests the cell cycle at 
the G0/G1 phase and induces apoptotic-mediated cell death in SW-480 cells. In 
addition, sacubitrilat inhibited HDAC isoforms at the transcriptomic level by 
0.7-0.9 fold and at the proteomic level by 0.5-0.6 fold as compared to the 
control. Sacubitrilat increased the protein expression of tumor-suppressor (p53)

expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Nrf2 proteins by 0.2-0.5 fold with respect

ferromagnetism is observed in tensile-strained LaCoO3 films, however, its origin 
remains controversial. Here we simultaneously reveal the formation of ordered 
oxygen vacancies and previously unreported long-range suppression of CoO6 
octahedral rotations throughout LaCoO3 films. Supported by density functional 
theory calculations, we find that the strong modification of Co 3d-O 2p 
hybridization associated with the increase of both Co-O-Co bond angle and Co-O 
bond length weakens the crystal-field splitting and facilitates an ordered 
high-spin state of Co ions, inducing an emergent ferromagnetic-insulating state. 
Our work provides unique insights into underlying mechanisms driving the 
ferromagnetic-insulating state in tensile-strained ferroelastic LaCoO3 films 
while suggesting potential applications toward low-power spintronic devices.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-39369-6

of urban spatial structure elements on carbon emissions efficiency can provide a 
scientific basis and practical guidance for low-carbon and sustainable urban 
development. This study uses the megacity of Chengdu as an example to measure 
and analyze the spatial carbon emission efficiency and multidimensional spatial 
structure elements by building a high-resolution grid and identifying the main 
spatial structure elements that affect urban carbon emissions and their impact 
weights via the Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) and Geographically 
Weighted Regression (GWR). The spatial heterogeneity of the impact of each 
element is also explored. The results show that the overall carbon emission 
efficiency of Chengdu is high in the center and low on the sides, which is 
related to urban density, functional mix, land use, and traffic structure. 
However, the influence of each spatial structure element is different in the 
developed central areas, developing areas of the plain, mountainous developing 
areas, underdeveloped areas of the plain, and mountainous underdeveloped areas. 
Thus, it is appropriate to form differentiated urban planning strategies based 
on the characteristics of the development of each zone. The findings provide 
inspiration and a scientific basis for formulating policies and practice to the 
future low-carbon development of Chengdu, while provide a reference for other 
growing megacities.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-36575-6

menorrhagia, and dysmenorrhea for women at the reproductive age. High-intensity 
focused ultrasound (HIFU) is effective in destroying target tumor tissues 
without damaging the path of the ultrasound beam and surrounding normal tissues. 
The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LN-IUS) is a medical system 
which is inserted into the uterine to provide medicinal treatment for temporary 
control of the symptoms caused by adenomyosis. This study was to investigate the 
effect of HIFU combined with the LN-IUS on adenomyosis. In the HIFU treatment, 
the parameters of the ultrasound were transmission frequency 0.8 MHz and input 
power 50-400 W (350 ± 30), and the temperature in the target tissue under these 
conditions would reach 60-100 °C (85 °C ± 6.3 °C). Size reduction and blood flow 
signal decrease were used to assess the effect of combined treatment. In this 
study, 131 patients with adenomyosis treated with HIFU combined with LN-IUS were 
retrospectively enrolled. The clinical and follow-up data were analyzed. After 
treatment, the volume of the uterine lesion was significantly decreased with an 
effective rate of 72.1%, and the adenomyosis blood flow signals were 
significantly reduced, with an effective rate of 71.3%. At six months, the 
menstrual cycle was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased from 31.4 ± 3.5 days 
before treatment to 28.6 ± 1.9 days, the menstrual period was significantly 
shortened from 7.9 ± 1.2 days before HIFU to 6.5 ± 1.3 days, and the menstrual 
volume was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased from 100 to 49% ± 13%. The serum 
hemoglobin significantly (P < 0.05) increased from 90.8 ± 6.2 g/L before 
treatment to 121.6 ± 10.8 g/L at six months for patients with anemia. Among 
seventy-two (92.3%) patients who finished the six-month follow-up, sixty-five 
(90.3%) patients had the dysmenorrhea completely relieved, and the other seven 
(9.7%) patients had only slight dysmenorrhea which did not affect their daily 
life. Adverse events occurred in 24 (18.3%) patients without causing severe 
consequences, including skin burns in two (1.5%) patients, skin swelling in four 
(3.1%), mild lower abdominal pain and low fever in 15 (11.5%), and subcutaneous 
induration in three (2.3%). Six months after treatment, no other serious side 
effects occurred in any patients with follow-up. In conclusions, the use of 
high-intensity focused ultrasound combined with the levonorgestrel-releasing 
intrauterine system for the treatment of adenomyosis is safe and effective even 
though the long-term effect remains to be confirmed.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-37096-y

the study and implementation of non-Hermitian bosonic quantum systems with 
strong non-linear interactions. The possibility to actuate on them with a time 
dependent drive could provide for example the means to induce resonant 
inter-level transitions, or to perform Floquet engineering or 
Landau-Zener-Stückelberg state preparation. Here, we introduce polaromechanical 
metamaterials, two-dimensional arrays of μm-sized traps confining 
zero-dimensional light-matter polariton fluids and GHz phonons. A strong 
exciton-mediated polariton-phonon interaction induces a time-dependent 
inter-site polariton coupling J(t) with remarkable consequences for the 
dynamics. When locally perturbed by continuous wave optical excitation, a 
mechanical self-oscillation sets-in and polaritons respond by locking the energy 
detuning between neighbor sites at integer multiples of the phonon energy, 
evidencing asynchronous locking involving the polariton and phonon fields. These 
results open the path for the coherent control of dissipative quantum light 
fluids with hypersound in a scalable platform.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-38788-9

herbicide that has been discovered to be tenacious and relatively durable in 
both soil and water. It is known to have adverse and unpleasant effects on 
humans causing several health complications. Therefore, the determination of 
picloram is profoundly effective because of its bio-accumulative and persistent 
nature. Because of this, a sensitive, rapid, and robust detection system is 
essential to detect traces of this molecule. In this study, we have constructed 
a novel nanohybrid system comprising of an UZMWCNT and rGO decorated on AuNPs 
modified glassy carbon electrode (UZMWCNT + rGO/AuNPs/GCE). The synthesized 
nanomaterials and the developed system were characterized using techniques such 
as SEM, XRD, SWV, LSV, EIS, and chronoamperometry. The engineered sensor surface 
showed a broad linear range of 5 × 10-2 nM to 6 × 105 nM , a low limit of 
detection (LOD) of 2.31 ± 0.02 (RSD < 4.1%) pM and a limit of quantification 
(LOQ) of 7.63 ± 0.03 pM. The response time was recorded to be 0.2 s, and the 
efficacy of the proposed sensor system was studied using rice water and soil 
samples collected from the agricultural field post filtration. The calculated 
recovery % for picloram in rice water was found to be 88.58%-96.70% (RSD < 3.5%, 
n = 3) and for soil it was found to be 89.57%-93.24% (RSD < 3.5%, n = 3). In 
addition, the SWV responses of both the real samples have been performed and a 
linear plot have been obtained with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 and 0.96 
for rice and soil samples, respectively. The interference studies due to the 
coexisting molecules that may be present in the samples have been found to be 
negligible. Also, the designed sensor has been evaluated for stability and found 
to be highly reproducible and stable towards picloram detection.",© 2023. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-34536-7
