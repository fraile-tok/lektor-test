chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell 
(HSC) transplantation. Previous studies have shown the important roles of B cell 
immunity in cGVHD development. Here, we investigated the long-term 
reconstitution of B lymphopoiesis after PTCy using murine models. We first 
demonstrated that the immune homeostatic abnormality leading to cGVHD is 
characterized by an initial increase in effector T cells in the bone marrow and 
subsequent B and Treg cytopenia. PTCy, but not cyclosporine A or rapamycin, 
inhibits the initial alloreactive T cell response, which restores intra-bone 
marrow B lymphogenesis with a concomitant vigorous increase in Tregs. This leads 
to profound changes in posttransplant B cell homeostasis, including decreased B 
cell activating factors, increased transitional and regulatory B cells, and 
decreased germinal center B cells. To identify the cells responsible for 
PTCy-induced B cell tolerance, we selectively depleted Treg populations that 
were graft or HSC derived using DEREG mice. Deletion of either Treg population 
without PTCy resulted in critical B cytopenia. PTCy rescued B lymphopoiesis from 
graft-derived Treg deletion. In contrast, the negative effect of HSC-derived 
Treg deletion could not be overcome by PTCy, indicating that HSC-derived Tregs 
are essential for maintaining favorable B lymphopoiesis following PTCy. These 
findings define the mechanisms by which PTCy restores homeostasis of the B cell 
lineage and reestablishes immune tolerance.","DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.162180

of molecular features with definitive meanings that preserve the manifold of the

tumorigenesis, and drug resistance and response. We found that SCMER can 
identify non-redundant features that sensitively delineate both common cell 
lineages and rare cellular states. SCMER can be used for discovering molecular 
features in a high dimensional dataset, designing targeted, cost-effective 
assays for clinical applications, and facilitating multi-modality integration.","DOI: 10.1038/s43588-021-00070-7

and is characterized as clinically and biologically heterogeneous lymphomas with 
diverse response to therapy and variation in clinical behavior. It's 
well-established that c-MYC and BCL2 play important roles in normal B-cell 
differentiation and tumorigenesis. B cell lymphoma with dual expression of c-MYC 
and BCL2 (double-expressor lymphoma, DEL) accounts for approximately one-third 
of DLBCL cases. DEL patients have poor outcomes after chemoimmunotherapy or 
autologous stem-cell transplantation. Lack of a genetic mouse tool for DEL 
hinders us from understanding the lymphogenesis mechanism and developing 
therapeutic strategies. Here, we investigated whether ectopic expression of 
c-MYC and BCL2 in different stages of B cells could lead to lymphoma and 
generate a mouse model for DEL. We observed that Co-expression of c-MYC and BCL2 
in germinal center (GC) B cells, or pan-B cells could induce B cell lymphomas. 
The tumor-bearing mice have enlarged lymphoid organs, and B cells massively 
infiltrate into non-lymphoid organs including lung, liver and kidney. The 
tumor-bearing mice also manifested significantly shorter lifespan than the 
controls. In addition, adoptive transfer of Co-expression B cells leads to B 
cell lymphoma and host mice death. This model will provide us a tool to further 
explore the pathogenesis and treatment approaches for DEL.","Copyright © 2020 Cai, Zhang, Cao, Wang, Wang, Bian, Zhai and Wang.","DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01007

and differentiation. Since monoclonal gammopathies (MG) refer to B mature 
lymphocyte neoplasms, lymphogenesis should be well known. We must keep in mind 
that the last stage of maturation of these lymphocytes is the plasma cell. This 
is how a MG could appear in the context of a plasma cell neoplasm, such as 
multiple myeloma or amyloidosis, but also in relation to a lymphoma. A 
monoclonal peak is produced by mature B lymphocytes or plasma cells that secrete 
a monoclonal protein (Immunoglobulin), and represents a MG. But it must be 
emphasized that, in the correct clinical context, a hypogammaglobulinemia can 
represent a MG as well. Another important point is the understanding and 
interpretation of requested tests, such as protein electrophoresis (PEP), 
immunofixation (IFx) or serum free light chains (sFLC). The current MG screening 
panel includes these three studies (PEF, IFx, sFLC), although a simpler panel 
measuring PEF and sFLC has also been proposed, but not yet formally validated.

antibody deficiency disease due to various causative genes. Several genes, which 
are known to be the cause of different diseases, have recently been reported as 
the cause of CVID in patients by performing whole exome sequencing (WES) 
analysis. Here, we found FANC gene mutations as a cause of adult-onset CVID in 
two patients. B cells were absent and CD4+ T cells were skewed toward CD45RO+ 
memory T cells. T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and signal joint 
kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (sjKRECs) were undetectable in 
both patients. Both patients had no anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. 
Using WES, we identified compound heterozygous mutations of FANCE in one patient 
and homozygous mutation of FANCA in another patient. The impaired function of 
FANC protein complex was confirmed by a monoubiquitination assay and by 
chromosome fragility test. We then performed several immunological evaluations 
including quantitative lymphocyte analysis and TRECs/sjKRECs analysis for 32 
individuals with Fanconi anemia (FA). In total, 22 FA patients (68.8%) were 
found to have immunological abnormalities, suggesting that such immunological 
findings may be common in FA patients. These data indicate that FANC mutations 
are involved in impaired lymphogenesis probably by the accumulation of DNA 
replication stress, leading to CVID. It is important to diagnose FA because it 
drastically changes clinical management. We propose that FANC mutations can 
cause isolated immunodeficiency in addition to bone marrow failure and 
malignancy.","DOI: 10.1007/s10875-017-0396-4

combination of Wnt/β-catenin and EGF/Ras signaling, has been demonstrated to 
form epithelial morphogenesis. ARL4C overexpression, due to Wnt/β-catenin and 
EGF/Ras signaling alterations, was involved in tumorigenesis. It was also 
reported that ARL4C expression correlates with DNA hypomethylation in the 
3'-untranslated region (UTR) of ARL4C gene during lymphogenesis. The current 
study was conducted to investigate the expression and functions of ARL4C due to 
DNA hypomethylation in lung and tongue cancers. Immunohistochemical analyses of 
tissue specimens obtained from lung and tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
patients revealed that ARL4C is not observed in non-tumor regions, but is 
strongly expressed at high frequencies in tumor lesions. Although inhibition of 
Wnt/β-catenin or Ras/MAP kinase signaling did not decrease ARL4C expression in 
NCI-H520 lung SCC cells, ARL4C DNA was clearly hypomethylated in the 3'-UTR. 
Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) enzyme, which mediates 
DNA demethylation, was highly expressed in NCI-H520 cells. Knockout of TET 
family proteins (TET1-3) in NCI-H520 cells reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine 
(5hmC) levels and promoted DNA methylation in the 3'-UTR, leading to the 
decrease in ARL4C expression and ARL4C-mediated cellular migration. In tumor 
lesions of ARL4C-positive lung SCC, 5hmC was frequently detected and DNA 
methylation in the 3'-UTR of ARL4C gene was lower than in non-tumor regions, 
which were consistent with the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. These results 
suggest that ARL4C is expressed due to hypomethylation in the 3'-UTR for certain 
types of cancers and that ARL4C methylation status is involved in cancer cell 
function.","DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.13147

activator protein (BSAP), activates B-cell commitment genes and represses 
non-B-cell lineage genes. About 14 transcript variants of PAX5 have been 
observed in human. Any alteration in its expression pattern leads to 
lymphogenesis or associated diseases and carcinogenesis in non-lymphoid tissues. 
Its mechanisms of function in pathophysiology of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 
are unclear. This study was intended to explore influence of PAX5 in cascade of 
NHL pathogenesis and diagnosis.
METHODS: Samples of 65 patients were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining 
for cellular localization of PAX5, CD19, CD3, cABL, p53, Ras and Raf and by 
TUNEL assay, RNA-isolation and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, w0 estern blot 
analysis, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) specific staining.
RESULTS: B-cell type NHL patients were positive for PAX5, p53, Ras, CD19, Raf 
and CD3. All of them showed TUNEL-positive cells. The differential expression 
pattern of PAX5, CD19, p53, CD3, Zap700 , HIF 1α, Ras, Raf and MAPK 
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) at the levels of transcripts and proteins was 
observed. The LDH assay showed modulation of LDH4 and LDH5 isoforms in the lymph 
nodes of NHL patients.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The histological observations suggested that the 
patients represent diverse cases of NHL like mature B-cell type, mature T-cell 
type and high grade diffuse B-cell type NHL. The findings indicate that patients 
with NHL may also be analyzed for status of PAX5, CD19 and ZAP70, and their 
transcriptional and post-translational variants for the differential diagnosis 
of NHL and therapy.","DOI: 10.4103/0971-5916.191747

development, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Different miRNAs are 
uniquely expressed in lymphoid T cells, and play a role indevelopment and 
differentiation of various subtypes by targeting their target genes. Recent 
studies have shown that aberrant miRNA expression may be involved in T cell 
leukemogenesis and lymphogenesis, and may function as tumor suppressor (such as 
miR-451, miR-31, miR-150, and miR-29a) or oncogene (e.g. miR-222, miR-223,

endothelium, and show that this population is capable of differentiating to

from hiPSCs are able to undergo full VDJ rearrangement and express surface IgM 
(sIgM(+)), thus representing an immature B-cell subset. Efficiency of sIgM 
expression on the hiPSC-derived B lymphocytes (∼ 5% of CD19(+) cells) was 
comparable with B lymphocytes generated from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) 
hematopoietic progenitor cells. Importantly, when assessed by global 
transcriptional profiling, hiPSC-derived B-cells show a very high level of 
similarity when compared with their UCB-derived counterparts, such that from 
more than 47,000 different transcripts, only 45 were significantly different 
(with a criteria adjusted P value P<0.05, log FC >1.5 or 2.8-fold). This

CD172a, swine workshop cluster (identification number) (SWC) 7, and μHC, porcine 
BM cells were resolved into seven subsets representing sequential stages of 
development. Profile of rearrangement-specific products and transcripts from 
sorted BM cells confirmed the proposed developmental pathway. The same 
developmental pathway was further proven by analysis of selection for productive 
rearrangements in Ig H chains and also by cultivation studies. Cultivation also 
showed that earliest precursors with incomplete DJ rearrangements can still 
revert their B cell differentiation and develop along myeloid lineage, whereas 
this is impossible for later developmental stages. Proliferation and the 
apoptotic potential of individual developmental stages as well as critical 
checkpoints were also identified. Colocalization experiments showed early 
colocalization of MHC-II/CD2/CD172a is replaced by colocalization of 
MHC-II/CD2/CD21/SWC7/IgM in immature cells, whereas CD25 and CD45RC did not 
colocalize with any other studied molecules. In this study, we also finally 
prove that the BM in pigs is fully functional in adult animals and that B

signaling, is required for inner cell mass survival during early embryonic 
development. However, little is known about its role in adult hematopoietic stem 
cells (HSCs) and hematopoiesis. Here we generated a conditional knockout mouse 
model that acutely deletes Grp78 in the adult hematopoietic system. Acute GRP78 
ablation resulted in a significant reduction of HSCs, common lymphoid and 
myeloid progenitors, and lymphoid cell populations in the mutant mice. The 
GRP78-null induced reduction of the HSC pool could be attributed to increased 
apoptosis. Chimeric mice with Grp78 deletion only in the hematopoietic cells 
also showed a loss of HSCs and lymphopenia, suggesting a cell intrinsic effect. 
Analysis of GRP78 deficient bone marrow (BM) cells showed constitutive 
activation of all the major UPR signaling pathways, including activation of 
eIF2α, ATF6, xbp-1 splicing, as well as caspase activation. A multiplex cytokine 
assay further revealed alteration in select cytokine and chemokine serum levels 
in the mutant mice. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that GRP78 plays a 
pleiotropic role in BM cells and contributes to HSC survival and the maintenance

worldwide and characterized by immunodeficiency, although B cells are present, 
and by characteristic rearrangements in the vicinity of the centromeres (the 
juxtacentromeric heterochromatin) of chromosomes 1 and 16 and sometimes 9. Other 
variable symptoms of this probably under-diagnosed syndrome include mild facial 
dysmorphism, growth retardation, failure to thrive, and psychomotor retardation. 
Serum levels of IgG, IgM, IgE, and/or IgA are low, although the type of 
immunoglobulin deficiency is variable. Recurrent infections are the presenting 
symptom, usually in early childhood. ICF always involves limited hypomethylation 
of DNA and often arises from mutations in one of the DNA methyltransferase genes 
(DNMT3B). Much of this DNA hypomethylation is in 1qh, 9qh, and 16qh, regions 
that are the site of whole-arm deletions, chromatid and chromosome breaks, 
stretching (decondensation), and multiradial chromosome junctions in 
mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. By an unknown mechanism, the DNMT3B deficiency 
that causes ICF interferes with lymphogenesis (at a step after class switching) 
or lymphocyte activation. With the identification of DNMT3B as the affected gene 
in a majority of ICF patients, prenatal diagnosis of ICF is possible. However,

high proportion of in-frame rearrangements, undergo switch recombination in 
thymus on DG60 and use N-region insertion from the time of the earliest VDJ 
rearrangement. The genomic repertoire of VH, DH and JH genes is small compared 
to mice and humans and swine appear to depend on junctional diversity for the

it is generally accepted that it operates by the same mechanism in all tissues. 
We show that in swine, the frequency of in-frame (IF) VDJ rearrangements differs

All VDJ rearrangements recovered and analyzed on the 20th day of gestation

corresponds to the time when lymphopoiesis begins in the bone marrow. 
Thereafter, the proportion of IF rearrangements drops to approximately 71%, 
i.e., the value predicted whether VDJ rearrangement is random and both 
chromosomes were involved. Unlike other tissues, VDJs recovered from thymus 
after DG50 display a pattern suggesting no selection for IF rearrangements. 
Regardless of differences in the proportion of IF rearrangements, we observed no 
significant age- or tissue-dependent changes in CDR3 diversity, N region 
additions, or other characteristics of fetal VDJs during ontogeny. These

fetal ontogeny. The hematopoietic system develops first in the yolk sac, then in 
fetal liver and finally in the bone marrow. Using flow cytometry (FCM) and 
molecular biological techniques we show that B-cell lymphogenesis and the 
appearance of B cells follows a pattern. First, VDJ rearrangement occurs at the 
20th day of gestation (DG20) in the yolk sac at a time when light chain 
transcription is absent. Next, B-cell lymphogenesis is detected at DG30 in the 
fetal liver. Thereafter, bone marrow becomes the major B lymphopoietic organ 
(DG45). In yolk sac and fetal liver, more than 90% of the VDJ rearrangements 
were in-frame but expression of micro heavy chain could not be clearly detected 
by FCM. However, cells with a putative phenotype of B-cell precursors are 
present. These cells express high levels of MHC class II (SLA-DR) and low levels 
of CD2 and CD25. CDR3 length analysis (spectratyping) indicates that the heavy 
chain repertoire is oligoclonal at this time with large inter-animal variations.

critical and unsolved biological problem. Precedent from invertebrate 
development, and from vertebrate myogenesis and lymphogenesis, has established 
that cell specification often involves transcription factors that are expressed 
throughout the differentiation of a given cell type. In this study, we have 
identified in Zn2+ finger transcription factor RU49 as a definitive marker for 
the cerebellar granule neuron lineage. Thus, RU49 is expressed in the earliest 
granule cell progenitors at the rhombic lip as they separate from the 
ventricular zone of the neural tube to generate a secondary proliferative 
matrix, and it continues to be expressed in differentiating and mature granule 
neurons. Proliferating granule cell progenitors isolated from the rhombic lip at 
E14 or from the external germinal layer at P6 continue to express RU49 in vitro. 
Both the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus granule cell lineages also express 
this factor as they are generated with the developing brain. RU49 binds a novel 
bipartite DNA-binding element in a manner consistent with chemical rules 
governing the DNA-binding specificity of this class of transcription factor. The 
novel biochemical properties of RU49 and its restricted expression within the 
three lineages of CNS granule neurons suggest that RU49 may play a critical role 
in their specification. Furthermore, these results raise the interesting 
possibility that the generation of these three neuronal populations to form 
displaced germinative zones within the developing brain may reflect their use of 
a common developmental mechanism involving RU49.","DOI: 10.1242/dev.122.2.555

thymus at early development has been established. By phenotype analysis of the 
transformants obtained, we observed that B cell precursors, susceptible to 
Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)- or Harvey murine sarcoma virus 
(H-MuSV)-induced lymphogenesis, were present at high frequency in the fetal 
thymus of BALB/c mice. These precursors recolonized alymphoid thymus lobes in 
vitro, as do T cell precursors. It was further observed that B precursors in the 
fetal liver were also capable of recolonizing alymphoid thymus lobes and were 
stored in a thymic environment. These results suggest that stroma cells of the 
fetal thymus may possess the capacity to support the growth of B precursors. On 
the other hand, B cell precursors sensitive to the viral transformation were 
undetectable in the fetal thymus of C57BL/6, although immunohistochemical 
analysis suggested their presence. However, in the fetal liver of the same 
strain, B precursors recolonizing alymphoid thymus in vitro were sensitive to 
the viral transformation. Based on these results, we will discuss both the role 
and fate of thymic B precursors. In addition, we also obtained T cell lymphomas 
at different stages of differentiation from the fetal thymus of C57BL/6 infected 
with A-MuLV or H-MuSV. These data indicate the usefulness of our system in 
establishing cell lines derived from intrathymic lymphogenesis at early 
development.","DOI: 10.1002/eji.1830190116
