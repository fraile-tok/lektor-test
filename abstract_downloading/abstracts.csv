pathophysiology of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Previously we have shown that 
phytoestrogens like daidzein and medicarpin exhibit immunoprotective effects, by 
virtue of which they alleviate bone loss. With this background, 
methoxyisoflavones like formononetin (formo) and isoformononetin (isoformo) that 
have been studied for preventing bone loss in ovariectomized rats were tested 
for their immunomodulatory effects in estrogen-deficient bone loss mice model.
METHODS: Adult Balb/c mice (N = 8/group) were given oral dose of formo and 
isoformo at 10 mg/kg body weight, post ovariectomy (Ovx) daily for 6 weeks. 
Animals were autopsied and long bones were harvested to study bone 
microarchitecture. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated for 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA analysis. Serum was collected for 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: It was observed that formo and isoformo treatment to Ovx mice led to 
significant restoration of Ovx-induced deterioration of trabecular 
microarchitecture. Pro-osteoclastogenic subset Th17 and B cells were decreased 
in formo/isoformo-treated Ovx mice in comparison with vehicle-treated Ovx group. 
Formo and isoformo treatment to Ovx mice also led to decreased expression of 
Th17 diffentiation factors and promoted T-regulatory cell differentiation. Formo 
was more effective in enhancing the FOXP3 expression compared with isoformo. 
IL-17A-induced osteoclastogenesis and inhibition of osteoblast apoptosis were 
also suppressed by formo and isoformo treatment, with formo having a more potent 
effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the immunomodulatory activity of 
methoxyisoflavones, formo, and isoformo, which translate into improved skeletal 
parameters, thereby preventing Ovx-induced bone loss.","DOI: 10.1097/GME.0000000000000646

mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (GML). By using this 
experimental system, we screened, for the first time to our knowledge, 
Helicobacter pylori GML-associated strains for their capacity to promote 
disease. A cohort of BALB/c mice underwent thymectomy at day 3 after birth 
(d3Tx). Successful thymic ablation was evaluated by the degree of lymphopenia in 
blood samples collected at 4 weeks of age. d3Tx and non-thymectomized controls 
were infected with either GML strains (B38 or B47) or control strains (SS1 or 
TN2GF4). Gastric samples collected at 6, 12, and 18 months after infection were 
studied for bacteria content, and submitted to histological, immunochemical, 
molecular, and immunological analyses. Severe gastric inflammation was only 
observed in d3Tx mice. In these animals, the gastric lamina propria was 
infiltrated with lymphoid cells organized in follicles composed of B cells with 
few infiltrating T cells. PCR of D/J IgH gene segments proved the monoclonality 
of infiltrating B cells, which strongly correlated with the presence of 
lymphoepithelial lesions. B-cell infiltrates were particularly prominent in mice 
infected with the B47-GML strain. No pathological changes were detected in 
noninfected d3Tx mice. We identified new H. pylori isolates adapted to the mouse 
stomach with high potential of GML development, which is only revealed in hosts 
rendered lymphopenic by neonatal thymic ablation.","Copyright © 2014 American Society for Investigative Pathology. Published by

system. T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines, including receptor activator 
of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 17 
(IL-17), all of which augment osteoclastogenesis. RANKL and TNF-α are targeted 
by inhibitors such as denosumab, a human monoclonal RANKL antibody, and 
infliximab, which neutralizes TNF-α. IL-17 is also an important mediator of bone 
loss, and an antibody against IL-17 is undergoing phase II clinical trial for 
rheumatoid arthritis. Although there are a few studies showing suppression of 
Th17 cell differentiation and induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by 
infliximab, the effect of denosumab remains poorly understood. In this study, we 
investigated the effects of anti-TNF-α, anti-RANKL, or anti-IL-17 antibody 
administration to estrogen-deficient mice on CD4(+) T-cell proliferation, CD28 
loss, Th17/Treg balance and B lymphopoesis, and finally, the translation of 
these immunomodulatory effects on skeletal parameters. Adult Balb/c mice were 
treated with anti-RANKL/-TNF-α/-IL-17 subcutaneously, twice a week, 
postovariectomy (Ovx) for 4 weeks. Animals were then autopsied; bone marrow 
cells were collected for FACS and RNA analysis and serum collected for ELISA. 
Bones were dissected for static and dynamic histomorphometry studies. We 
observed that although anti-RANKL and anti-TNF-α therapies had no effect on 
Ovx-induced CD4(+) T-cell proliferation and B lymphopoesis, anti-IL-17 
effectively suppressed both events with concomitant reversal of CD28 loss. 
Anti-IL-17 antibody reduced proinflammatory cytokine production and induced 
Tregs. All three antibodies restored trabecular microarchitecture with 
comparable efficacy; however, cortical bone parameters, bone biomechanical 
properties, and histomorphometry were best preserved by anti-IL-17 antibody, 
likely attributable to its inhibitory effect on osteoblast apoptosis and 
increased number of bone lining cells and Wnt10b expression. Based on the 
superior immunoprotective effects of anti-IL-17, which appears to translate to a 
better skeletal preservation, we propose beginning clinical trials using a 
humanized antibody against IL-17 for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.",© 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.,"DOI: 10.1002/jbmr.2228

Scientific and Industrial Research), Chattar Manzil, Lucknow, India.","Estrogen deficiency leads to an upregulation of TNF-α producing T cells and 
B-lymphopoesis which augments osteoclastogenesis. Estrogen deficiency also 
increases the population of premature senescent CD4⁺ CD28null T cells which 
secrete a higher amount of TNF-α thus leading to enhanced osteoclastogenesis. 
Isoflavonoids like daidzein and genistein are found mostly in soybeans, legumes, 
and peas. These share structural similarity with 17β-stradiol (E2) and have 
osteoprotective role. This study explores the effect of daidzein (Daid) on the 
proliferation of TNF-α producing T cells, premature senescent T cells and B cell 
lymphopoesis under estrogen deficient conditions. For this study adult Balb/c 
mice were treated with Daid at 10 mg/kg body weight dose by oral gavage daily 
post ovariectomy (Ovx). After six weeks animals were autopsied and bone marrow 
and spleen cells were collected for FACS analysis. Blood serum was collected for 
ELISA. It was observed that Ovx mice treated with Daid for six weeks show 
reduction in Ovx induced expansion of CD4⁺ T cells in bone marrow and spleen 
when analysed by flow cytometry. Estrogen deficiency led to increased prevalence 
of TNF-α secreting CD4⁺CD28null T cells, however, treatment with Daid increased 
the percentage of CD4⁺CD28⁺ T cells. Co-culture of CD4⁺CD28null T cells and bone 
marrow resulted in enhanced osteoclastogenesis as evident by increased tartarate 
resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression, an osteoclast marker. However, 
treatment with Daid resulted in reduced osteoclastogenesis in CD4⁺CD28null T 
cells and bone marrow cell co-culture. Daid also regulated B lymphopoesis and 
decreased mRNA levels of RANKL in B220⁺ cells. Taken together, we propose that 
one of the mechanisms by which Daid prevents bone loss is by reversing the 
detrimental immune changes as a result of estrogen deficiency.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021216

Various abnormalities in the immunoregulation system have been reported in 
patients with MDS. Most of studies were about lymphocytes in peripheral blood. 
There weren't reports described lymphopoesis in the peripheral blood after 
reclassification of MDS according WHO. We analyzed retrospectively subopulations 
of lymphocytes in bone marrow of patients with MDS recognized according to the 
WHO classification.
INVESTIGATED GROUP: There were 58 patients, 24 women and 34 men. We recognized 
following subtypes of MDS: 5 pts with RA (8.5%), 22-RCMD (38%), 4-RCMD-RS (7%), 
14-RAEB1 (24%), 9-RAEB2 (15.5%), 3-MDS-U (5%),1-5q-.
METHODS: Cell staining was performed in whole bone marrow during routine 
phenotyping with using following antibodies: anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, 
anti-CD16, anti-CD56, anti-CD19. All of the results have been statistically 
tested by using t-Student test and Spearmans correlation.
RESULTS: There percentage of cells CD3+ was statistically larger, lymphocytes 
CD19+ statistically smaller, than in healthy in pts with MDS. In analyzed 
subtypes of MDS: RCMD, RAEB 1 and RAEB2 we detected statistically larger

normal B-cell lymphopoesis, migration and homing to the bone marrow (BM) and 
previous studies have suggested a role for CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 in the 
pathogenesis of ALL.
PURPOSE: CXCL12 levels in serum were evaluated from ALL-children and controls. 
The biological effect of recombinant CXCL12 on primary leukaemic cells was 
investigated. Signalling via the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis was further characterized in 
an in vitro model using the pre-B leukaemic cell line Nalm-6.
RESULTS: The serum level of CXCL12 in children at diagnosis of pre-B-ALL is 
significantly higher than in healthy children (4.8 (0-32) ng/ml vs. 0 (0-3.2) 
ng/ml, P < 0.001). After completed chemotherapy, CXCL12 decreases to levels 
comparable to those found in the control group. In addition, we found that 
recombinant CXCL12 enhances pre-B leukaemic cell proliferation in vitro. The 
CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is able to initiate functional signalling and we show that 
STAT5 is activated in CD19+ leukaemic cells from BM of ALL patients and in the 
leukaemic cell line Nalm-6.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CXCL12 may have a role in leukaemic cell 
proliferation and survival during childhood ALL.","(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","DOI: 10.1002/pbc.21370

Germany.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chemokines are members of the largest group of chemotactic 
cytokines, and were the first shown to be able to engage specific subpopulations 
of inflammatory cells. Accordingly, our expanding knowledge in chemokine biology 
has enlarged our understanding of inflammatory cell interactions, lymphopoesis, 
specificity of cell recruitment, and a variety of human diseases. This review 
covers recent developments on chemokines in renal diseases.
RECENT FINDINGS: Intrinsic renal cells are capable of chemokine expression in 
vitro and in vivo, and the involved induction pathways are becoming increasingly 
defined. Differential chemokine expression during the time course of disease, 
followed by an infiltration of cells expressing the corresponding receptors has 
been described in animal models. Therapeutic efficacy of chemokine blockade has 
been demonstrated in a variety of disease models, including progressive 
interstitial fibrosis. Chemokine receptors are differentially expressed and 
localized to specific parenchymal compartments in human renal diseases, as 
revealed by studies of renal biopsies, and some functional roles of specific 
chemokine/receptor interactions can be deduced through the correlation of 
patterns of expression, genetic variations and disease courses.
SUMMARY: Chemokines play an important role in renal inflammation. Although the 
treatment of patients with renal diseases using chemokine receptor blocking 
agents has not yet reached clinical practice, a recent body of data indicates 
that human renal disease might be amenable to such approaches.","DOI: 10.1097/00041552-200305000-00004

peripheral blood, with the peak being observed at day 6 of treatment. As a 
result, CD4/CD8 ratio in blood and spleen was significantly higher in treated 
than in untreated mice. Splenocytes from treated mice proliferated more 
vigorously in response to Con A. When added in vitro, Milife also mildly 
costimulated Con A-induced proliferation of splenocytes from intact animals. In 
conclusion, we have found that Milife can stimulate leuko- and lymphopoesis in 
BLRB mice, in particular, accumulation of CD4+ T cells in peripheral lymphoid 
organs. We conclude that Milife may represent an immunomodulator with the 
potential to correct T cell dysfunction in patients with immunodeficiency.","DOI: 10.3109/08923979809034812

selectively co-stimulates IL-2 production, but not proliferation in 
TCR-stimulated murine Th1 cells.","Sommer F(1), Huber M, Röllinghoff M, Lohoff M.","Author information:
(1)Institute of Clinical Microbiology, University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany.","The murine CD44 receptor family is thought to be involved in a variety of 
lymphocyte functions, including lymphopoesis, lymphocyte homing and cell 
migration. Herein, we show that murine CD44 also plays a role as a 
co-stimulatory molecule for the activation of CD4+ T cells. Ligation of CD44 by 
mAb enhanced IL-2 production of long-term cultured, anti-CD3-stimulated Th1 cell 
lines. Moreover, anti-CD44 mAb synergized with anti-CD28 mAb in exerting this 
effect. A synergism of anti-CD28 and anti-CD44 mAb to co-stimulate IL-2 
production was also observed in anti-CD3-triggered, freshly isolated splenic 
CD4+ T cells. Blocking experiments with cyclosporin A indicated that the 
intracellular pathways used by the CD28 and CD44 molecules appear to be 
different. In contrast to the effects on the IL-2 production of Th1 cells, 
neither anti-CD44 mAb alone nor the combination of anti-CD44 with anti-CD28 were 
able to induce proliferation of anti-CD3-triggered Th1 cells. In accordance, 
triggering of CD44 and/or CD28 by mAb was not sufficient to reverse the 
previously described 'proliferative block'. This term describes the 
unresponsiveness of Th1 cells against IL-2, which occurs when Th1 cells are 
triggered by anti-CD3 in the absence of co-signals. These data lead us to 
propose a model of Th1 cell activation which includes two functionally different 
types of co-signals: one for IL-2 production and a separate one for 
proliferation.","DOI: 10.1093/intimm/7.11.1779

undergo certain phase reorganizations, specific for each age period. The 
greatest development of the thymic connective tissue frame reaches at the age of 
1-3 years and during sex maturation period. The thymic lymphoepithelial tissue

rubomycin, olivomycin, bruneomycin and karminomycin administered 
intraperitoneally in a single LD50 to mice were studied. It was found that the 
general toxicity of bruneomycin and karminomycin was almost the same and 5 to 8 
times higher than that of rubomycin and olivomycin. The use of the above 
antibiotics resulted in definite shifts in the blood systems of healthy mice. 
The most significant suppression of hemopoesis accompanied by a pronounced 
depression of the number of the myelocariocytes was observed after the use of 
olivomycin. The effect of karminomycin was characterized by suppression of 
erythro-, myelo- and lymphopoesis and depression of the number of the 
granulocytes and lymphocytes of the blood. Bruneomycin and rubomycin had a 
short-time myeloinhibitory effect. The erythroid cords of the bone marrow proved 
to be most sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the antibiotics. However, 
inhibition of the erythropoesis accompanied by deep reticulocytopenia did not 
induce the respective depression of the erythrocyte number. The lymphoid cords 
was in the 2nd place by its sensitivity to the antibiotics and the myeloid and 
megocariocytal cords were in the 3rd and the 4th places respectively. Complete 
reduction of hemopoesis in the animals was observed by the 10th day of the drugs 
use.",PMID: 1211886 [Indexed for MEDLINE]
