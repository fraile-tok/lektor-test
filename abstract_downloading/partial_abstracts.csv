Preprint.","Loss of thymocyte competition underlies the tumor suppressive functions of the 
E2a transcription factor in T lymphocyte acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","Parriott G, Hegermiller E, Morman RE, Frank C, Saygin C, Stock W, Bartom ET, Kee 
BL.","T lymphocyte acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is frequently associated with 
increased expression of the E protein transcription factor inhibitors TAL1 and 
LYL1. In mouse models, ectopic expression of Tal1 or Lyl1 in T cell progenitors 
or inactivation of E2a, is sufficient to predispose mice to develop T-ALL. How 
E2a suppresses thymocyte transformation is currently unknown. Here, we show that 
early deletion of E2a , prior to the DN3 stage, was required for robust 
leukemogenesis and was associated with alterations in thymus cellularity, T cell 
differentiation, and gene expression in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. 
Introduction of wild-type thymocytes into mice with early deletion of E2a 
prevented leukemogenesis, or delayed disease onset, and impacted the expression 
of multiple genes associated with transformation and genome instability. Our 
data indicate that E2a suppresses leukemogenesis by promoting T cell development 
and enforcing inter-thymocyte competition, a mechanism that is emerging as a 
safeguard against thymocyte transformation. These studies have implications for 
understanding how multiple essential regulators of T cell development suppress 
T-ALL and support the hypothesis that thymus cellularity is a determinant of 
leukemogenesis.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.23.537993

2023  May 4.",Spatiotemporal regulation of peripheral T cell tolerance.,"Brown CC, Rudensky AY.","The incomplete removal of T cells that are reactive against self-proteins during 
their differentiation in the thymus requires mechanisms of tolerance that 
prevent their effector function within the periphery. A further challenge is 
imposed by the need to establish tolerance to the holobiont self, which 
comprises a highly complex community of commensal microorganisms. Here, we 
review recent advances in the investigation of peripheral T cell tolerance, 
focusing on new insights into mechanisms of tolerance to the gut microbiota, 
including tolerogenic antigen-presenting cell types and immunomodulatory 
lymphocytes, and their layered ontogeny that underlies developmental windows for 
establishing intestinal tolerance. While emphasizing the intestine as a model 
tissue for studying peripheral T cell tolerance, we highlight overlapping and 
distinct pathways that underlie tolerance to self-antigens versus commensal 
antigens within a broader framework for immune tolerance.","DOI: 10.1126/science.adg6425

cancer immunotherapy in a Lef-1 and Tcf-1 dependent manner.","Rangel Rivera GO, Dwyer CJ, Knochelmann HM, Smith AS, Aksoy A, Cole AC, Wyatt 
MM, Thaxton JE, Lesinski GB, Paulos CM.","Generating stem memory T cells (T SCM ) is a key goal for improving cancer 
immunotherapy. Yet, the optimal way to modulate signaling pathways that enrich T 
SCM properties remains elusive. Here, we discovered that the degree to which the 
PI3Kδ pathway is blocked pharmaceutically can generate T cells with differential 
levels of stemness properties. This observation was based on the progressive 
enrichment of transcriptional factors of stemness (Tcf-1 and Lef-1). Additional 
investigation revealed that T cells with high stemness features had enhanced 
metabolic plasticity, marked by heightened mitochondrial function and glucose 
uptake. Conversely, T cells with low or medium features of stemness expressed 
more inhibitory checkpoint receptors (Tim-3, CD39) and were vulnerable to 
antigen-induced cell death. Only TCR-antigen specific T cells with high stemness 
persisted following adoptive transfer in vivo and mounted protective immunity to 
melanoma tumors. Likewise, the strongest level of PI3Kδ blockade in vitro 
generated human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and CAR T cells with 
heightened stemness properties, in turn bolstering their capacity to regress 
human mesothelioma tumors. We find that the level of stemness T cells possess in 
vitro differentially impacts their potency upon transfer in three tumor models. 
Mechanistically, both Lef-1 and Tcf-1 sustain anti-tumor protection by high T 
SCM , as deletion of either one compromised cellular therapy. Collectively, 
these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of carefully modulating PI3Kδ 
signaling in T cells to confer high stemness and mediate protective responses to 
solid tumors.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.08.531589

Complete Response in HER2-positive Breast Cancer With Carboplatin-based 
Neoadjuvant Therapy.","Wang L, Zhang X, Ma X, Ren X, Ma X, Shan B, Liu Y.","CONTEXT: Neoadjuvant therapy is the primary treatment for stage II to III breast 
cancer (BC). The heterogeneity of BC challenges the identification of effective 
neoadjuvant regimens and of the related sensitive populations.
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to explore the predictive role of inflammatory 
cytokines, immune-cell subsets, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for 
the accomplishment of the pathological complete response (pCR) after a 
neoadjuvant regimen.
DESIGN: The research team conducted a phase II, single-armed, open-label trial.
SETTING: The study took place at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University 
in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 42 patients at the hospital receiving treatment 
for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) 
between November 2018 and October 2021.
INTERVENTION: Participants received neoadjuvant therapy of six cycles of 
docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCbH).
OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team: (1) measured 13 cytokines and immune-cell 
populations in peripheral blood prior to neoadjuvant therapy administration; (2) 
measured TILs in tumor tissues; (3) analyzed correlations among biomarkers and 
pCR.
RESULTS: Of the 42 participants, 18 achieved pCR (42.9%) after the neoadjuvant 
therapy, with 37 having an overall response rate (ORR) of 88.1%. All 
participants experienced at least one short-term adverse event. The most common 
toxicity was leukopenia, with 33 participants (78.6%), while no cardiovascular 
dysfunction occurred. Compared with the non-pCR group, the pCR group had higher 
serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-ɑ), with P = .013; interleukin 
6 (IL-6), with P = .025; and IL-18, with P = .0004. Univariate analysis showed 
that IL-6 (OR, 3.429; 95% CI,1.838-6.396; P = .0001) had a significant 
correlation with pCR. Participants in the pCR group had a higher level of 
natural killer T (NK-T) cells (P = .009) and a lower ratio of cluster of 
differentiation 4 (CD4):CD8 (P = .0014) before neoadjuvant therapy. Univariate 
analysis linked a high population of NK-T cells (OR, 0.204; 95% CI,0.052-0.808; 
P = .018), a low CD4:CD8 ratio (OR, 10.500; 95% CI, 2.475-44.545; P = .001), and

provided no authoritative explanations about the mechanisms to assist in 
clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to examine the characteristics of the onset 
seasons within in one year and time periods within one day of an AMI, determine 
the correlation between morbidity rates from AMIs at different time points, and 
analyze the dendritic cell (DC) functions, thus providing a reference for 
clinical prevention and treatment.
DESIGN: The research team a retrospective analysis of clinical data of AMI 
patients.
SETTING: The study took place at the Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical 
University in Weifang, China.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 339 AMI patients whom the hospital had admitted 
and treated. The research team divided participants into two groups: (1) those ≥ 
60 years old and (2) those <60 years old.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team: (1) calculated and recorded the onset times 
and percentages for all participants at the different time points and determined 
the morbidity or death rates for the periods, (2) analyzed the seasonal 
distribution for the two groups using the circular-distribution method, (3) 
measured the DC functions of all participants, (4) analyzed the DC functions, 
and (5) determined the correlation between the morbidity and death rates from 
AMIs at different time points.
RESULTS: The morbidity rate for all participants from AMIs during the period 
from 6:01 am to 12:00 PM was significantly higher than that between 0:01 AM and 
6:00 AM (P < .001), between 12.01 PM and 18:00 PM (P < .001), and between 18:00 
pm and 24:00 PM (P < .001). The death rate for all participants from AMIs 
between January and March was significantly higher than that between April and 
June (P = .022) and that between July to September (P = .044). The morbidity 
rate from AMIs in different time periods within one day and the death rate from 
AMIs in different seasons were positively correlated with both the expression 
level of cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86) on the DCs and the absorbance (A) 
value under the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) condition (all P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The time period between 6:01 AM and 12:00 PM within one day and the 
seasonal period between January and March within one year were the periods with 
high levels of morbidity and death, respectively, and the onset of AMIs had a 
correlation with DC functions. Medical practitioners should take specific 
preventive measures to reduce the morbidity and death rates from AMIs.",PMID: 36881530 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

these groups of variants, we investigated the association between 
cluster-specific genetic risk scores and phenotypes in the COPDGene cohort. We 
observed differences in steroid use, BMI, lymphocyte counts, chronic bronchitis,

worldwide, and no effective cure exists for advanced GC. Clinicians believe that 
molecularly targeted therapy through PCGs may replace surgery, radiotherapy, and 
other treatments as a breakthrough in curing malignancies.
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to examine the impact of aberrant expression of 
the protein-coding genes (PCGs) associated with regulatory T cells on the 
prognosis of patients with gastric cancer (GC).
DESIGN: The research team performed a genetic study through research of genetic 
data in online databases.
SETTING: The study took place at Zhongda Hospital.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team selected a publicly available dataset, 
genetic suppressor element 109476 (GSE109476), from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database for differential gene analysis, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis to screen for 
PCGs associated with regulatory T cells as well as the Gene Expression Profiling 
Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database with the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database to 
analyze the expression of the above PCGs in GC and the prognostic impact on GC.
RESULTS: The GEO2R analysis found 315 differentially expressed PCGs in 
GSE109476, among which nine PCGs were associated with regulatory T cells: (1) 
chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19), (2) CCL21, (3) C-C chemokine receptor 
type 7 (CCR7), (4) cluster of differentiation 70 (CD70), (5) ephrin B3 (EFNB3), 
(6) early growth response 3 (EGR3), (7) interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R), (8) 
galectin-1 (LGALS1), and (9) tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily 
member 13C (TNFRSF13C). The GEPIA database indicated that no significant 
differences existed between the expression of CCL19, CCL21, CD70, EFNB3, EGR3, 
IL7R, and TNFRSF13C in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) tissues and that in normal 
tissues (P > .05), while expressions of CCR7 and LGALS1 were significantly 
elevated in STAD tissues compared to the normal tissues (P < .05). The 
Kaplan-Meier Plotter database analysis, on the other hand, showed a significant 
relationship between all of the above-mentioned PCGs, except CCL19, and the 
prognosis of GC.
CONCLUSIONS: CCL19, CCL21, CCR7, CD70, EFNB3, EGR3, IL7R, LGALS1, and TNFRSF13C 
are PCGs are differentially expressed in GC and closely associated with
