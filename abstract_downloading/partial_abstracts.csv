Units.","Lehet CR, Lopez JA, Frank RJ, Cvach M.","Background: Telemetry monitoring is intended to improve patient safety and 
reduce harm. However, excessive monitor alarms may have the undesired effect of 
staff ignoring, silencing, or delaying a response due to alarm fatigue. Outlier 
patients, or those patients who are responsible for generating the most monitor 
alarms, contribute to excessive monitor alarms. Methods: Daily alarm data 
reports at a large academic medical center indicated that one or two patient 
outliers generated the most alarms daily. A technological intervention aimed at 
reminding registered nurses (RNs) to adjust alarm thresholds for patients who 
triggered excessive alarms was implemented. The notification was sent to the 
assigned RN's mobile phone when a patient exceeded the unit's seven-day average 
of alarms per day by greater than 400%. Results: A reduction in average alarm 
duration was observed across the four acute care telemetry units (P < 0.001), 
with an overall decrease of 8.07 seconds in the postintervention versus 
preintervention period. However, alarm frequency increased significantly (χ23 = 
34.83, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Implementing a technological intervention to 
notify RNs to adjust alarm parameters may reduce alarm duration. Reducing alarm 
duration may improve RN telemetry management, alarm fatigue, and awareness. More 
research is needed to support this conclusion, as well as to determine the cause 
of the observed increase in alarm frequency.","DOI: 10.2345/0899-8205-57.2.67

Epub  2023 Jun 21.",Chemical Changes Over Time Associated with Protein Drying.,"Kimble A, Ratanski C, Kremer TA.","Upon drying, physical changes of the characteristics of proteins are observed by 
coagulation, but the nature and chronology of these changes have not been well 
studied. Coagulation changes the structure of protein from liquid to a solid or 
a thicker liquid by heat, mechanical action, or acids. Changes may have 
implications regarding the cleanability of reusable medical devices; therefore, 
an understanding of the chemical phenomena associated with drying of proteins is 
essential to ensuring adequate cleaning and mitigation of retained surgical 
soils. Using a high-performance gel permeation chromatography analysis with 
right-angle light-scattering detector at 90°, it was demonstrated that as soils 
dry, the molecular weight distribution changes. From the experimental evidence, 
the molecular weight distribution trends over time with drying to higher values. 
This is interpreted as a combination of oligomerization, degradation, and 
entanglement. As water is removed through evaporation, the distance between 
proteins decreases and their interactions increase. Albumin will polymerize into 
higher-molecular-weight oligomers, decreasing its solubility. Mucin, commonly 
found in the gastrointestinal tract to prevent infection, will degrade in the 
presence of enzymes releasing low-molecular-weight polysaccharides and leaving 
behind a peptide chain. The research described in this article investigated this 
chemical change.","DOI: 10.2345/0899-8205-57.2.52

from being processed within the specified time outlined in manufacturers' 
instructions for use. It has been suggested in the literature and industry 
standards that residual soil components, such as proteins, may undergo a 
chemical change when they are exposed to heat or experience prolonged drying 
times under ambient conditions. However, little experimental data are available 
in the literature to document this change or how is may be addressed for 
cleaning efficacy. This study presents the effects of time and environmental 
conditions on contaminated instrumentation from the point of use until the 
cleaning process begins. It demonstrates that soil drying after a period of 
eight hours changes the solubility of the soil complex, with a significant 
change occurring after 72 hours. Temperature also contributes to chemical 
changes in protein. Although no significant difference occurred between 4°C and 
22°C, temperatures greater than 22°C demonstrated a decrease in soil solubility 
in water. An increase in humidity prevented the soil from completely drying and 
prevented the chemical changes affecting solubility from occurring.","DOI: 10.2345/0899-8205-57.2.58

Epub  2023 Jun 21.",Cleaning Challenges: Can Extended Soil Dry Times Be Reversed?,"Hoover J, Drosnock MA, Carfaro C, Kremer TA.","Background: Cleaning is essential to ensuring the safe processing of reusable 
medical devices, and most manufacturers' instructions for use (IFUs) specify 
that clinical soil should not be allowed to dry on devices. If soil is allowed 
to dry, the cleaning challenge could be increased due to change in soil 
solubility. As a result, an additional step could be needed to reverse the 
chemical changes and return a device to a state where cleaning instructions are 
appropriate. Methods: Using a solubility test method and surrogate medical 
devices, the experiment described in this article challenged eight remediation 
conditions to which a reusable medical device might be exposed if soil is dried 
on a device. These conditions included soaking with water or neutral pH, 
enzymatic, or alkaline detergent cleaning agents, as well as conditioning with 
an enzymatic humectant foam spray. Results: The results demonstrated that only 
the alkaline cleaning agent was able to solubilize the extensively dried soil as 
effectively as the control, with a 15-minute soak being as effective as a 
60-minute soak. Discussion: Although opinions vary, the overall data 
demonstrating the risk and chemical changes that occur when soil dries on 
medical devices are limited. Further, in cases in which soil is allowed to dry 
on devices for an extended time outside of the guidance from leading practices 
and manufacturers' IFUs, what additional steps or processes may be necessary to 
ensure that cleaning can be effective? Conclusion: This experiment demonstrated 
the effectiveness of a soaking step with an alkaline cleaning agent as an 
additional step if soil is dried on reusable medical devices, thus reversing the 
effect of an extended soil dry time.","DOI: 10.2345/0899-8205-57.2.44

Current Stimulation.","Zhang L, Chen L, Wang Z, Liu X, Ming D.","Motor imagery (MI), as a cognitive motor process, involves the coordinated 
activation of frontal and parietal cortices and has been widely studied as an 
effective way to improve motor functions. However, there are large 
inter-individual differences in MI performance, with many subjects unable to 
elicit sufficiently reliable MI brain patterns. It has been shown that dual-site 
transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied on two brain sites 
can modulate functional connectivity between the targeted regions. Here, we 
investigated whether electrically stimulating frontal and parietal regions using 
dual-site tACS at mu frequency will modulate motor imagery performance. 
Thirty-six healthy participants were recruited and randomly divided into 
in-phase (0° lag), anti-phase (180° lag) and sham stimulation group. All groups 
performed the simple (grasping movement) and complex (writing movement) motor 
imagery tasks before and after tACS. Simultaneously collected EEG data showed 
that the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu rhythm and classification 
accuracy during complex task were significantly improved after anti-phase 
stimulation. In addition, anti-phase stimulation resulted in decreased 
event-related functional connectivity between regions within frontoparietal 
network in the complex task. In contrast, no beneficial after-effects of 
anti-phase stimulation were found in the simple task. These findings suggest 
that dual-site tACS effects on MI dependent on the phase lag of the stimulation 
and the complexity of the task. Anti-phase stimulation applied to the 
frontoparietal regions is a promising way to foster demanding MI task.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3286419

to Moderately Anxious Adults.","Durocher JJ, Phelan HL, Toorongian CA, Vyas AP, Morin BE.","CONTEXT: Anxiety is a common mental health concern in the USA that is associated 
with an increased risk of hypertension, arterial stiffness, and cardiovascular 
disease. Therapists have used eight-week programs for mindfulness meditation to 
treat anxiety; however little is known about the psychophysiological effects of 
a single meditation session.
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to assess the effects of a one-hour, 
mindfulness-meditation session on anxiety symptomology and cardiovascular 
function, including aortic pulsatility.
DESIGN: The research team performed a prospective, single-group study.
SETTING: The study took place at Michigan Technological University.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 14 young adults with an initial Beck Anxiety 
Inventory (BAI) score of 8 to 26, showing mild to moderate anxiety.
INTERVENTION: Participants took part in a single, one-hour, guided, 
mindfulness-meditation session.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team: (1) administered the BAI during an 
orientation session and at 60-minutes post intervention, and (2) measured the 
cardiovascular variables of qualified participants at the orientation, at 
baseline prior to the intervention, immediately post intervention, and at 60 
minutes post intervention, including systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), 
diastolic arterial blood pressure (DAP), heart rate (HR), aortic pulse pressure 
(aPP), aortic pulsatility, aortic augmentation index (AIx) at 75 bpm, 
carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity 
(cfPWV), and respiratory rate.
RESULTS: Participants had a significant decrease in the BAI scores between 
baseline and 60-minutes post intervention (P = .01) and a significant reduction 
in aortic pulsatility-aPP x HR-between baseline and immediately post 
intervention and between baseline and 60-minutes post intervention (both P < 
.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results suggest that one hour of introductory 
mindfulness meditation can have both psychological and cardiovascular benefits 
for anxious individuals.",PMID: 37315230 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Pilot Study.","Chidananda K, Singh D, Amit K, Mahadevappa V, Krishna D.","BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with cognitive 
decline. Lifestyle behaviors such as yoga practices play a significant role in 
preventing cognitive decline.
PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the effect of yoga intervention on 
working memory and prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation in T2DM patients.
METHODS: Twenty T2DM participants, aged between 40 and 60 years, volunteered for 
a 6-week study. Participants were randomized into a yoga practice (n = 10) and a 
waitlist control group (n = 10). The n-back task was administered to evaluate 
working memory before and after the intervention. While performing the working 
memory task, PFC oxygenation was monitored using functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy.
RESULTS: The yoga group showed a significant improvement in working memory 
performance. The accuracy improved in 1-back (mean difference of 4.73%, 95% 
CI[0.69,8.77], P = .026) and 2-back (8.0%, 95% CI[1.89,14.1], P = .016) task 
conditions. The reaction time improved in 0-back (mean difference of -79.07 
milliseconds, 95% CI[-128.3,-29.8]), 1-back (mean difference of -119.17 
milliseconds, 95% CI[-217.5,-20.8] ) and 2-back (-76.06 milliseconds, 95% 
CI[-148.8,-3.3]) task conditions. In the yoga group, at post-intervention, 
higher oxygenation was observed during 0-back and 1-back task conditions (Beta 
coefficient mean difference of 211.3, 95% CI[2.8, 420.0], P = .048 and 80.5, 95% 
CI [3.7,157.2], P = .042 respectively) in the left PFC region compared to the 
pre-intervention values. The control group showed no significant change in 
working memory performance and PFC oxygenation.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that yoga practice may improve working memory 
performance and facilitate higher PFC oxygenation in T2DM patients. Further 
studies with a larger sample and a longer intervention period are required to 
strengthen the findings.",PMID: 37315229 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Health Outcomes: A Comprehensive Review.","Liu J, Yang Y, Zhu Y, Hou X, Li S, Chen S, Yang J.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to comprehensively review empirical 
evidence on the effectiveness of Baduanjin exercise, one type of mind-body 
focused qigong exercise, on individuals' physical, cognitive, and mental 
well-being; outline potential mechanisms; and, suggest potential implication 
strategies for using Baduanjin in clinical practices and for future research.
METHODS: Recent randomized-controlled studies and systematic 
reviews/meta-analyses published in English were searched in PubMed, PsycINFO, 
and Scopus up to July 2022. The search terms include Baduanjin and sleep, 
chronic illness, cognition, mental health, etc. We only selected papers that 
specifically studied the health effects of Baduanjin, excluding those that 
involved other forms of Qigong or other traditional Chinese medical practices. 
Since many RCT studies have already been included in the review papers that we 
selected, only those not covered in the review papers were selected to avoid 
repetition.
RESULTS: 19 recent randomized-controlled studies and 8 systematic reviews were 
identified. In general, the effectiveness of Baduanjin exercise on individuals' 
physical, cognitive, and mental health is evident. Baduanjin has proven to be 
effective in improving sleep quality, including reducing difficulties in getting 
asleep and reducing daytime sleepiness. It also reduces fatigue and improves the 
quality of life for patients with other physical health issues, such as cancer, 
musculoskeletal pain, and chronic illnesses. The effectiveness of Baduanjin 
exercise is also evident in cognition, improving executive functions, and 
slowing down age-related cognitive deterioration. Similarly, Baduanjin 
alleviates various types of mental illnesses, increases patients' social 
competence, and enhances emotional regulation.
CONCLUSION: There is initial evidence on the safety and efficacy of Baduanjin in 
improving individuals' various aspects of health and well-being, suggesting that 
Baduanjin may serve as an effective adjunct to conventional treatments for a 
variety of clinical health benefits. More research is needed to confirm the 
efficacy and safety of Baduanjin in other non-Chinese ethnic populations.",PMID: 37315228 [Indexed for MEDLINE]
93. Adv Mind Body Med. 2023 Spring;37(2):5-8.,"Effect of a Single Yoga Asana on Blood Glucose Levels in Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus: A Self-Controlled Study.","Tamilselvi G, Venkateshwaran ST, Aruchunan M.","CONTEXT: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar 
levels. Yoga has been shown to have positive effects on blood sugar levels in 
diabetes patients. However, there is limited research on the effects of specific 
yoga poses on blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a single yoga asana, Ardha 
Matsyendrasana, on random blood glucose (RBG) levels in patients with T2DM. 
Specifically, we aimed to investigate whether a 15-minute practice of Ardha 
Matsyendrasana could reduce RBG levels in patients with T2DM.
DESIGN: This study employed a self-controlled design to evaluate the effect of 
Ardha Matsyendrasana on blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.
PARTICIPANTS: 100 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were recruited 
for this study.
INTERVENTIONS: All participants underwent two sessions: a control session (CS) 
and an asana session (AS), each lasting 15 minutes. During the CS, participants 
rested in a sitting pose, while during the AS, they practiced Ardha 
Matsyendrasana. The order of the sessions was randomized, with half the 
participants undergoing the CS on day 1, the AS on day 2, and the other half 
undergoing the sessions in reverse order.
OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured participants' random blood glucose (RBG) levels 
immediately before and after each intervention.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The statistical package for the social sciences, version 
16, was used to perform a paired t-test to compare RBG levels before and after 
each intervention.
RESULTS: The study demonstrated a significant reduction in random blood glucose 
(RBG) levels in the Ardha Matsyendrasana session compared to the control 
session. This trend was observed in both males and females with T2DM.
CONCLUSIONS: A single session of Ardha Matsyendrasana for 15 minutes can 
effectively reduce blood glucose levels in patients with T2DM. However, further 
studies are required to determine the long-term effects of this asana on 
glycemic control.",PMID: 37315227 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

data, which has become popular and vital in many fields such as signal 
processing and computer vision. It varies with different tensor decomposition 
frameworks. Compared with matrix SVD, recently emerging transform t-SVD can 
better characterize the low-rank structure of order-3 data. However, it suffers 
from rotation sensitivity, and dimensional limitation (i.e., only effective for 
order-3 tensors). To alleviate these deficiencies, we develop a novel multiplex 
transformed tensor decomposition (MTTD) framework, which can characterize the 
global low-rank structure along all modes for any order- N tensor. Based on 
MTTD, we propose a related multi-dimensional square model for low-rank tensor 
completion. Besides, a total variation term is also introduced to utilize the 
local piecewise smoothness of the tensor data. The classic alternating direction 
method of multipliers is used to solve the convex optimization problems. For 
performance testing, we choose three linear invertible transforms including FFT, 
DCT, and a group of unitary transform matrices for our proposed methods. The 
simulated and real-data experiments demonstrate the superior recovery accuracy 
and computational efficiency of our method compared with state-of-the-art ones.","DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2023.3284673

on Inertial Motion Capture Data.","Wang Z, Gao F, Wu Z, Wang D, Guo X, Yu S.","Anatomical landmark trajectories are commonly used to define joint coordinate 
systems in human kinematic analysis according to standards proposed by the 
International Society of Biomechanics (ISB). However, most inertial motion 
capture (IMC) studies focus only on joint angle measurement, which limits its 
application. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method to calculate the 
trajectories of anatomical landmarks based on IMC data. The accuracy and 
reliability of this method were investigated by comparative analysis based on 
measurement data from 16 volunteers. The results showed that the accuracy of 
anatomical landmark trajectories was 23.4 to 57.3 mm, about 5.9% to 7.6% of the 
segment length, the orientation accuracy was about 3.3° to 8.1°, less than 8.6% 
of the range of motion (ROM), using optical motion capture results as the gold 
standard. Furthermore, the accuracy of this method is are similar to that of 
Xsens MVN, a commercial IMC system. The results also show that the algorithm 
allows for more in-depth motion analysis based on IMC data, and the output 
format is more versatile.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3285924

Epub  2023 Jun 19.",Facial Action Unit Detection via Adaptive Attention and Relation.,"Shao Z, Zhou Y, Cai J, Zhu H, Yao R.","Facial action unit (AU) detection is challenging due to the difficulty in 
capturing correlated information from subtle and dynamic AUs. Existing methods 
often resort to the localization of correlated regions of AUs, in which 
predefining local AU attentions by correlated facial landmarks often discards 
essential parts, or learning global attention maps often contains irrelevant 
areas. Furthermore, existing relational reasoning methods often employ common 
patterns for all AUs while ignoring the specific way of each AU. To tackle these 
limitations, we propose a novel adaptive attention and relation (AAR) framework 
for facial AU detection. Specifically, we propose an adaptive attention 
regression network to regress the global attention map of each AU under the 
constraint of attention predefinition and the guidance of AU detection, which is 
beneficial for capturing both specified dependencies by landmarks in strongly 
correlated regions and facial globally distributed dependencies in weakly 
correlated regions. Moreover, considering the diversity and dynamics of AUs, we 
propose an adaptive spatio-temporal graph convolutional network to 
simultaneously reason the independent pattern of each AU, the inter-dependencies 
among AUs, as well as the temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments show that 
our approach (i) achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks 
including BP4D, DISFA, and GFT in constrained scenarios and Aff-Wild2 in 
unconstrained scenarios, and (ii) can precisely learn the regional correlation 
distribution of each AU.","DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2023.3277794

based on natural language sentences. Although great efforts have been made to 
address the cross-modal heterogeneity, most of the current solutions suffer from 
only capturing salient attributes while ignoring inconspicuous ones, being weak 
in distinguishing very similar pedestrians. In this work, we propose the 
Adaptive Salient Attribute Mask Network (ASAMN) to adaptively mask the salient 
attributes for cross-modal alignments, and therefore induce the model to 
simultaneously focus on inconspicuous attributes. Specifically, we consider the 
uni-modal and cross-modal relations for masking salient attributes in the 
Uni-modal Salient Attribute Mask (USAM) and Cross-modal Salient Attribute Mask 
(CSAM) modules, respectively. Then the Attribute Modeling Balance (AMB) module 
is presented to randomly select a proportion of masked features for cross-modal 
alignments, ensuring the balance of modeling capacity of both salient attributes 
and inconspicuous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses have been carried out 
to validate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of our proposed ASAMN 
method, and we have obtained the state-of-the-art retrieval performance on the 
widely-used CUHK-PEDES and ICFG-PEDES benchmarks.","DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2023.3285426

Epub  2023 Jun 19.",Meta-Learning-Based Degradation Representation for Blind Super-Resolution.,"Xia B, Tian Y, Zhang Y, Hang Y, Yang W, Liao Q.","Blind image super-resolution (blind SR) aims to generate high-resolution (HR) 
images from low-resolution (LR) input images with unknown degradations. To 
enhance the performance of SR, the majority of blind SR methods introduce an 
explicit degradation estimator, which helps the SR model adjust to unknown 
degradation scenarios. Unfortunately, it is impractical to provide concrete 
labels for the multiple combinations of degradations (e. g., blurring, noise, or 
JPEG compression) to guide the training of the degradation estimator. Moreover, 
the special designs for certain degradations hinder the models from being 
generalized for dealing with other degradations. Thus, it is imperative to 
devise an implicit degradation estimator that can extract discriminative 
degradation representations for all types of degradations without requiring the 
supervision of degradation ground-truth. To this end, we propose a Meta-Learning 
based Region Degradation Aware SR Network (MRDA), including Meta-Learning 
Network (MLN), Degradation Extraction Network (DEN), and Region Degradation 
Aware SR Network (RDAN). To handle the lack of ground-truth degradation, we use 
the MLN to rapidly adapt to the specific complex degradation after several 
iterations and extract implicit degradation information. Subsequently, a teacher 
network MRDAT is designed to further utilize the degradation information 
extracted by MLN for SR. However, MLN requires iterating on paired LR and HR 
images, which is unavailable in the inference phase. Therefore, we adopt 
knowledge distillation (KD) to make the student network learn to directly 
extract the same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as the teacher from 
LR images. Furthermore, we introduce an RDAN module that is capable of 
discerning regional degradations, allowing IDR to adaptively influence various 
texture patterns. Extensive experiments under classic and real-world degradation 
settings show that MRDA achieves SOTA performance and can generalize to various 
degradation processes.","DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2023.3283922

Fine-Grained SAR Target Classification.","Yang M, Bai X, Wang L, Zhou F.","Restricted by observation conditions, some scarce targets in the synthetic 
aperture radar (SAR) image only have a few samples, making effective 
classification a challenging task. Although few-shot SAR target classification 
methods originated from meta-learning have made great breakthroughs recently, 
they only focus on object-level (global) feature extraction while ignoring 
part-level (local) features, resulting in degraded performance in fine-grained 
classification. To tackle this issue, a novel few-shot fine-grained 
classification framework, dubbed as HENC, is proposed in this article. In HENC, 
the hierarchical embedding network (HEN) is designed for the extraction of 
multi-scale features from both object-level and part-level. In addition, 
scale-channels are constructed to realize joint inference of multi-scale 
features. Moreover, it is observed that the existing meta-learning-based method 
only implicitly utilize the information of multiple base categories to construct 
the feature space of novel categories, resulting in scattered feature 
distribution and large deviation during novel center estimation. In view of 
this, the center calibration algorithm is proposed to explore the center 
information of base categories and explicitly calibrate the novel centers by 
dragging them closer to the real ones. Experimental results on two open 
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the HENC significantly improves the 
classification accuracy for SAR targets.","DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2023.3283065

47. ArXiv. 2023 Jan 30:arXiv:2301.13323v1. Preprint.,Fairness and Accuracy under Domain Generalization.,"Pham TH, Zhang X, Zhang P.","As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in high-stakes 
applications, concerns have arisen that they may be biased against certain 
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to make ML models 
fair, they typically rely on the assumption that data distributions in training 
and deployment are identical. Unfortunately, this is commonly violated in 
practice and a model that is fair during training may lead to an unexpected 
outcome during its deployment. Although the problem of designing robust ML 
models under dataset shifts has been widely studied, most existing works focus 
only on the transfer of accuracy. In this paper, we study the transfer of both 
fairness and accuracy under domain generalization where the data at test time 
may be sampled from never-before-seen domains. We first develop theoretical 
bounds on the unfairness and expected loss at deployment, and then derive 
sufficient conditions under which fairness and accuracy can be perfectly 
transferred via invariant representation learning. Guided by this, we design a 
learning algorithm such that fair ML models learned with training data still 
have high fairness and accuracy when deployment environments change. Experiments 
on real-world data validate the proposed algorithm. Model implementation is 
available at https://github.com/pth1993/FATDM.","PMCID: PMC10246117

Joint.","Chang H, Kyeong S, Na Y, Kim Y, Kim J.","In the robotics and rehabilitation engineering fields, surface electromyography 
(sEMG) signals have been widely studied to estimate muscle activation and 
utilized as control inputs for robotic devices because of their advantageous 
noninvasiveness. However, the stochastic property of sEMG results in a low 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and impedes sEMG from being used as a stable and 
continuous control input for robotic devices. As a traditional method, 
time-average filters (e.g., low-pass filters) can improve the SNR of sEMG, but 
time-average filters suffer from latency problems, making real-time robot 
control difficult. In this study, we propose a stochastic myoprocessor using a 
rescaling method extended from a whitening method used in previous studies to 
enhance the SNR of sEMG without the latency problem that affects traditional 
time average filter-based myoprocessors. The developed stochastic myoprocessor 
uses 16 channel electrodes to use the ensemble average, 8 of which are used to 
measure and decompose deep muscle activation. To validate the performance of the 
developed myoprocessor, the elbow joint is selected, and the flexion torque is 
estimated. The experimental results indicate that the estimation results of the 
developed myoprocessor show an RMS error of 6.17[%], which is an improvement 
with respect to previous methods. Thus, the rescaling method with multichannel 
electrodes proposed in this study is promising and can be applied in robotic 
rehabilitation engineering to generate rapid and accurate control input for 
robotic devices.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3281410

and hand dysfunction because of its ability to assist patients in high 
intensity, repetitive, targeted and interactive rehabilitation training. 
However, the existing wrist exoskeletons cannot effectively replace the work of 
therapist and improve hand function, mainly because the existing exoskeletons 
cannot assist patients to perform natural hand movement covering the entire 
physiological motor space (PMS). Here, we present a bioelectronic controlled 
hybrid serial-parallel wrist exoskeleton HrWr-ExoSkeleton (HrWE) which is based 
on the PMS design guidance, the gear set can carry out forearm 
pronation/supination (P/S) and the 2-DoF parallel configuration fixed on the 
gear set can carry out wrist flexion/extension (F/E) and radial/ulnar deviation 
(R/U). This special configuration not only provides enough range of motion (RoM) 
for rehabilitation training (85F/85E, 55R/55U, and 90P/90S), but also makes it 
easier to provide the interface for finger exoskeletons and be adapted to upper 
limb exoskeletons. In addition, to further improve the rehabilitation effect, we 
propose a HrWE-assisted active rehabilitation training platform based on surface

Reaching.","Plaisier TAM, Acosta AM, Dewald JPA.","Stretch reflexes are crucial for performing accurate movements and providing 
rapid corrections for unpredictable perturbations. Stretch reflexes are 
modulated by supraspinal structures via corticofugal pathways. Neural activity 
in these structures is difficult to observe directly, but the characterization 
of reflex excitability during volitional movement can be used to study how these 
structures modulate reflexes and how neurological injuries impact this control, 
such as in spasticity after stroke. We have developed a novel protocol to 
quantify stretch reflex excitability during ballistic reaching. This novel 
method was implemented using a custom haptic device (NACT-3D) capable of 
applying high-velocity (270 °/s) joint perturbations in the plane of the arm 
while participants performed 3D reaching tasks in a large workspace. We assessed 
the protocol on four participants with chronic hemiparetic stroke and two 
control participants. Participants reached ballistically from a near to a far 
target, with elbow extension perturbations applied in random catch trials. 
Perturbations were applied before movement, during the early phase of movement, 
or near peak movement velocity. Preliminary results show that stretch reflexes 
were elicited in the stroke group in the biceps muscle during reaching, as 
measured by electromyographic (EMG) activity both before (pre-motion phase) and 
during (early motion phase) movement. Reflexive EMG was also seen in the 
anterior deltoid and pectoralis major in the pre-motion phase. In the control 
group, no reflexive EMG was seen, as expected. This newly developed methodology 
allows the study of stretch reflex modulation in new ways by combining 
multijoint movements with haptic environments and high-velocity perturbations.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3283861

Schizophrenia.","Yan T, Wang G, Liu T, Li G, Wang C, Funahashi S, Suo D, Pei G.","Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous mental disorder with unknown etiology or 
pathological characteristics. Microstate analysis of the electroencephalogram 
(EEG) signal has shown significant potential value for clinical research. 
Importantly, significant changes in microstate-specific parameters have been 
extensively reported; however, these studies have ignored the information 
interactions within the microstate network in different stages of schizophrenia. 
Based on recent findings, since rich information about the functional 
organization of the brain can be revealed by functional connectivity dynamics, 
we use the first-order autoregressive model to construct the functional 
connectivity of intra- and intermicrostate networks to identify information 
interactions among microstate networks. We demonstrate that, beyond abnormal 
parameters, disrupted organization of the microstate networks plays a crucial 
role in different stages of the disease by 128-channel EEG data collected from 
individuals with first-episode schizophrenia, ultrahigh-risk, familial 
high-risk, and healthy controls. According to the characteristics of the 
microstates of patients at different stages, the parameters of microstate class 
A are reduced, those of class C are increased, and the transitions from intra- 
to intermicrostate functional connectivity are gradually disrupted. Furthermore, 
decreased integration of intermicrostate information might lead to cognitive 
deficits in individuals with schizophrenia and those in high-risk states. Taken 
together, these findings illustrate that the dynamic functional connectivity of 
intra- and intermicrostate networks captures more components of disease 
pathophysiology. Our work sheds new light on the characterization of dynamic 
functional brain networks based on EEG signals and provides a new interpretation 
of aberrant brain function in different stages of schizophrenia from the 
perspective of microstates.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3283708

Implants Modified by Various Combinations of Sandblasting, Acid-Etching, 
Hydroxyapatite, and Hyaluronic Acid Coating Techniques.","Yurttutan E, Dereci Ö, Karagöz MA.","PURPOSE: To compare the osseointegration process of the titanium dental implants 
with five different surface characteristics-sandblasted, sandblasted and 
acid-etched, hyaluronic acid-coated (HYA), hydroxyapatite-coated (HA), and 
machined-in an experimental sheep model at 1- and 3-month examinations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty dental implants were placed in the left 
and right tibias of 16 sheep. Five experimental groups were designed. Eight 
animals (80 implants) were used for biomechanical tests of reverse torque 
analysis and resonance frequency analysis (RFA). Eight of them (80 implants) 
were used for the evaluation of bone-to-implant contact (BIC) percentage in 
histomorphometric analysis. Forty of 80 implants (8 implants for each group) 
were used at 1-month examinations, and the remaining 40 (8 implants for each 
group) implants were used at 3-month examinations in the biomechanical test 
group and histomorphometric examination group, separately.
RESULTS: Intergroup analysis at the 3-month followup showed that the increase in 
the implant stability quotient (ISQ) value was statistically significant for 
only the HYA group (P < .05). According to ISQ values at 1 and 3 months, group 
HYA showed statistically higher values at the 1 and 3-month examinations (P < 
.05). Groups HYA and HA had statistically higher reverse torque values than 
other groups at the 1-month examination (P < .05). At the 3-month evaluation, 
the HYA group showed significantly higher reverse torque values compared to 
other groups (P < .05). The BIC values of the sandblasted and acid-etched, HYA, 
and HA groups were significantly higher than the sandblasted and machined groups 
at the 1- and 3-month examinations (P < .05). The BIC value for the HA group 
showed decreased value at the 3-month examination compared to the 1-month 
examination (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The RFA, reverse torque, and histomorphometric analysis at 1- and 
3-month examinations show that dental implants coated with HYA may have 
increased potential for osseointegration compared to dental implants with 
sandblasted, sandblasted and acid-etched, machined, and HA-coated surfaces. Int

Provisionalization with Customized Definite Abutment in Esthetic Zone: A 
Retrospective Study.","Yuan DX, Wu D, Cao X, Chen S, Wang X.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the hard and soft tissue alterations of immediate implant 
placement and provisionalization with customized definitive abutments in the 
esthetic zone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single unsalvageable maxillary anterior teeth were 
replaced with immediate implant placement and provisionalization with definitive 
abutments in 22 participants. Digital impressions and CBCT images were obtained 
presurgery, immediately after surgery, and 6 months after surgery. Horizontal 
and vertical buccal bone changes in thickness and height (HBBT, VBBH), vertical 
changes for the gingiva margin, mesial and distal papilla height, and horizontal 
changes for soft tissue (HCST) were analyzed using a 3D superimposition method.
RESULTS: Twenty-two participants completed the study. No implant failed, and 
there were no mechanical or biologic complications for any patients. At 6 months 
after surgery, the mean HBBT changes at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11.5, and 13 mm 
were -0.92 ± 0.73, -0.83 ± 0.53, -0.82 ± 0.49, -0.70 ± 0.64, -0.65 ± 0.47, -0.50 
± 0.51, -0.15 ± 0.45, -0.10 ± 0.57, and -0.00 ± 0.64 mm, respectively. The mean 
VBBH change was -0.61 ± 0.76 mm. The mean HCSTs at -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3 mm 
sub- and supra-implant shoulder were -0.65 ± 0.54, -0.70 ± 0.56, -0.65 ± 0.51, 
-0.61 ± 0.56, -0.47 ± 0.54, -0.47 ± 0.59, and -0.46 ± 0.59 mm, respectively. The 
mean gingiva margin recession was -0.38 ± 0.67 mm. The mean mesial papilla 
height recession was -0.03 ± 0.50 mm. The mean distal papilla height recession 
was -0.12 ± 0.56 mm.
CONCLUSION: The definitive abutment used with immediate implant placement and 
provisionalization could potentially maintain the buccal bone thickness and 
height. For the facial soft tissue, it also benefited the maintenance of the 
midfacial gingival margin position and papilla height during the 6-month 
follow-up. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 2023;38:479-488. doi:

Clinical Retrospective Study.","Yoo SY, Kim SK, Heo SJ, Koak JY, Seo KS.","PURPOSE: To verify the survival rates and marginal bone loss (MBL) of implants 
in patients with different disability types.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and radiographic assessments were performed in a 
total of 189 implants for fixed implant prostheses in 72 patients. Data were 
collected on loaded implants at least 1 year in function, and the mean 
observation time was 37.3 months. Implant survival was examined, and MBL was 
observed around the implants of two groups (mental disability vs physical 
disability) based on age, sex, implant location (anterior vs posterior), and 
prosthetic connection (internal vs external).
RESULTS: Of the 189 implants, 4 failed; the total implant survival rate was 
97.8% across a mean of 37.3 months. The cumulative survival rate at 85 months in 
a Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was 94.3% ± 3% in patients with mental 
disability and 50% ± 35.4% in patients with physical disability, which was a 
statistically significant difference between the disability groups (P = .006). 
Fisher exact test showed significant differences in MBL only with age (P < 
.001). The implant MBL by disability type-adjusted for age and observation 
period-showed significant differences in multiple linear regression analyses (P 
= .003).
CONCLUSION: The implant survival rates in patients with disability were in line 
with those reported for nondisabled patients. The MBL of the implants was within 
the physiologic bone loss after implant loading. Implants in patients with 
mental disability showed higher cumulative survival rates than in patients with 
physical disability, but also a higher amount of MBL. Within the limitations of 
this study, dental implants for patients with disability are viable. These 
results can establish future implant treatment plans for this population. Int J

Years: Part II-Success and Survival Rate Analysis.","Yi Y, Heo SJ, Koak JY, Kim SK, Koo KT.","PURPOSE: To analyze the success and survival of splinted and nonsplinted 
implants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 423 patients (n = implants: 888) were included 
in the study. The success and survival of implants for 15 years were analyzed 
using a multivariable Cox regression model, and the significant effect of the 
splinting of prostheses and other risk factors were evaluated.
RESULTS: The cumulative success rate was 34.2%: 33.2% in nonsplinted (NS) and 
34.8% in splinted implants (SP). The cumulative survival rate was 92.9% (94.1%, 
NS; 92.3%, SP). Whether to splint was not related to the success and survival of 
implants. The smaller the implant diameter, the lower the survival rate. The 
crown length and implant length were significantly associated only with NS 
implants: The longer the crown length and the shorter the implant length, the 
greater the risk of implant failure. The emergence angle (EA) and the emergence 
profile (EP) had a significant effect on only the SP implants: EA3 showed a 
higher risk than EA1, and EP2 and EP3 had a higher risk of implant failure.
CONCLUSION: Crown length and implant length affected only the nonsplinted 
implants: The higher the crown length and the shorter the implant length, the 
greater the risk of implant failure. A significant effect for emergence contour 
was found only in SP implants: the implants restored with prostheses with EA ≥ 
30 degrees on both the mesial and distal sides, and convex EP on at least one

were analyzed using the multivariable Cox regression model, and the significant 
effect of the splinting of prostheses and other risk factors were evaluated.
RESULTS: Biologic complications occurred in 38.7% of implants: 26.4% of 
nonsplinted implants (NS) and 45.4% of splinted implants (SP). Mechanical 
complications occurred in 49.2% of implants: 59.3% NS and 43.9% SP. Implants 
splinted with both mesial and distal adjacent implants (SP-mid) had the highest 
risk of peri-implant diseases. As the number of implants splinted increased, the 
risk of mechanical complications decreased. Long crown lengths increased the 
risk of both biologic and mechanical complications.
CONCLUSION: Splinted implants had a higher risk of biologic complications and 
lower risk of mechanical complications. The implant splinted to both adjacent

Strategy to Prevent Complications.","Wang J, Luo Y, Huang D, Huangphattarakul V, Man Y.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and performance of a potential novel strategy to 
resolve the above scenario by simultaneously performing implant-related surgery 
and endodontic microsurgery (EMS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 subjects requiring GBR during implant 
placement in anterior areas were allocated into two groups. In the experimental 
group (adjacent teeth with periapical lesions) with 10 subjects, implantation 
and GBR were performed for edentulous areas with simultaneous EMS for adjacent 
teeth. In the control group (adjacent teeth without periapical lesions) with 15 
subjects, implantation and GBR were performed for edentulous areas. The clinical 
outcomes, radiographic bone remodeling, and patient-reported outcomes were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Within a 1-year follow-up, the implant survival rate was 100% in both 
groups, with no significant difference regarding complications. All teeth 
achieved complete healing following EMS. Repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
measurements revealed a significant change over time in horizontal bone widths 
and postoperative patient-reported outcomes, but no intergroup statistically 
significant differences (P > .05) in horizontal bone widths and visual analog 
scale scores of pain, swelling, and bleeding were observed. Likewise, the bone 
volumetric decrease (7.4% ± 4.5% in the experimental group and 7.1% ± 5.2% in 
the control group) from T1 (suture removal) to T2 (6 months after implantation) 
revealed no intergroup differences. The horizontal bone width gain at the 
implant platform was slightly lower in the experimental group (P < .05). 
Interestingly, the color-coded figures of both groups showed a facial reduction 
of grafted material in edentulous areas. However, the apical regions following 
EMS exhibited stable bone remodeling in the experimental group.
CONCLUSION: This novel approach to address the problem involving implant-related 
surgery close to the periapical lesion of adjacent teeth appeared safe and 
reliable (no.: ChiCTR2000041153). Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants

Patients on Warfarin: A Randomized Clinical Study.","Vassallo M, Zamberlin J, Roig MD, Macchi R, Aguilar JE.","PURPOSE: To compare the frequency of immediate/short-term postoperative bleeding 
and occurrence of hematomas using tranexamic acid (TXA), bismuth subgallate 
(BS), or dry gauze (DG) as a local hemostatic agent, and to explore the relation 
between short-term bleeding and occurrence of intraoral and extraoral hematomas 
and length of incision, duration of surgery, and alveolar ridge recontouring in 
patients who were continued on oral anticoagulation therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty surgical procedures performed in 71 patients were 
assigned to one of four groups (20 each): control group (patients not on oral 
anticoagulant therapy) and three experimental groups (patients on oral 
anticoagulation therapy managed with local hemostatic measures): TXAg, BSg, or 
DGg. Studied variables were length of incision, duration of surgery, and 
alveolar ridge recontouring. Short-term bleeding episodes and occurrence of 
intraoral and extraoral hematomas were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 111 implants were placed. No significant differences in mean 
international normalized ratio, duration of surgery, and length of incision were 
observed among groups (P > .05). Short-term bleeding and intraoral and extraoral 
hematomas were observed in 2, 2, and 14 surgical procedures, respectively, and 
did not differ significantly among groups. Overall relation between variables 
showed no association between extraoral hematomas and duration of surgery/length 
of incision (P > .05). Association between extraoral hematomas and alveolar 
ridge recontouring was statistically significant (OR = 26.72). Association with 
short-term bleeding and intraoral hematomas was not studied due to the small 
number of events.
CONCLUSION: Implant placement in warfarin anticoagulated patients without 
withdrawing oral anticoagulation therapy is a safe and predictable procedure, 
and different local hemostatic agents (TXA, BS, and DG) are effective in 
managing postoperative bleeding. Development of hematomas may be higher in 
patients undergoing alveolar ridge recontouring. Further studies are necessary 
to confirm these results. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 2023;38:545-552. doi:

Dentists Without Structured Training: Results of a Retrospective Cross-Sectional 
Study.","Tong Z, Shi J, He F, Fan L, Wang Y, Si M.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the cumulative survival rate (CSR) of implants placed by 
Chinese dentists who lacked structured training and to identify the 
dentist-related risk factors associated with implant failure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2,036 patients who underwent implant-supported 
restoration at a university-affiliated stomatology hospital were collected. CSR 
was regarded as the dependent variable. Patient-related characteristics (age, 
sex, insertion site, and surgical complexity) and dentist-related factors 
(experience, number of implant brands used, education level, sex, and specialty) 
were collected as independent variables. The chi-square test was used to 
identify dentist-related factors for implant failure after addressing 
patient-related potential confounders using propensity score matching (PSM). 
Dentist- and patient-related risk factors were further analyzed using 
multivariable logistic regression within the subgroups.
RESULTS: The CSRs were 98.48% for patients (with single or multiple implants) 
and 98.86% for implants after 48 to 60 months of observation. Dentists with < 5 
years of experience and specialists in implant dentistry were significantly 
associated with implant failure after addressing potential patient-related 
confounders. Within the group of dentists with < 5 years of experience, 
complicated cases were the major risk factor. For the group of specialists in 
implant dentistry, < 5 years of experience and male patient were the major risk 
factors.
CONCLUSION: New dentists (< 5 years of experience) and specialists in implant 
dentistry are considered to be dentist-related risk factors for implant failure. 
This confirms that a learning curve exists for new specialists to reach the 
level of proficiency and expertise. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants

in Sheep.","Stocchero M, Jinno Y, Toia M, Ahmad M, Galli S, Papia E, Herath M, Becktor JP.","PURPOSE: To determine the biologic and biomechanical effects of two implant 
drilling protocols on the cortical bone around implants subjected to immediate 
loading.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 48 implants were inserted into the mandibles 
of six sheep following one of two drilling protocols: undersized preparation 
(US; n = 24) and nonundersized preparation (NUS; n = 24). Immediately after 
implant insertion, an abutment was placed on each implant and 36 implants were 
subjected to 10 sessions of dynamic vertical loads (1,500 cycles, 1 Hz) of 25 N 
or 50 N. Insertion torque value (ITV) was recorded at implant installation. 
Resonance frequency analysis (RFA) was measured at implant insertion and at each 
loading session. Fluorochrome was administered at day 17, and the animals were 
euthanized after 5 weeks. The removal torque values (RTVs) were measured, and 
samples underwent histomorphometric, μCT (microcomputed tomography), and 
fluorescence image acquisition analyses. The bone volume density (BV/TV), 
bone-to-implant contact (BIC), bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO), and 
fluorochrome stained bone surface (MS) were calculated. A linear mixed model 
analysis was performed, and Pearson paired correlation was calculated.
RESULTS: Five implants from the NUS group failed, with a mean ITV of 8.8 Ncm and 
an RFA value of 57. The mean ITVs for US group and NUS group were 80.5 (± 14) 
Ncm and 45.9 (± 25) Ncm, respectively (P < .001). No differences were noted in 
the RFA values from the time of implant insertion until the end of the study. No 
differences in RTV, BV/TV, BAFO, or MS were observed between the groups. Intense 
new bone formation took place in the NUS group implants that were subjected to 
load.
CONCLUSIONS: Undersized preparation of cortical bone ensured a greater BIC 
compared to a nonundersized preparation. Moreover, this study demonstrated that 
immediate loading did not interfere with the osseointegration process, but 
loading induced intense new bone formation in the NUS group. It is not 
recommended to immediately load the implants when the clinically perceived 
primary stability is lower than an ITV of 10 Ncm and an RFA value of 60. Int J

implants presenting at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 
2006 to 2013. Logistic regression, random forest classifiers, support vector

well as the loss of all or nearly all implants. Re-examination of their preand 
postoperative CBCTs, in combination with several bone biopsies, confirmed the

different outcomes from delayed loading with respect to midfacial mucosal level 
in the maxillary esthetic area.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted in four electronic 
databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane), identifying eligible 
clinical studies published prior to December 2021. Only randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) comparing immediate implant placement with or without immediate 
loading in the maxillary esthetic zone with a mean follow-up of at least 12 
months were selected for qualitative analysis and meta-analysis. The Cochrane 
Risk of Bias tool was adopted to assess the quality of the evidence. The 
heterogeneity between the pooled literature was analyzed through the chi-square 
test (P < .05) and quantified by the I2 index. A mixed-effects model was applied 
if it appeared that there was noteworthy heterogeneity; otherwise, a 
random-effects model was chosen. For continuous outcomes, the estimate of 
relative effect was presented to display the standardized mean differences 
(SMDs) and 95% CIs. For dichotomous variables, the Mantel-Haenszel statistical 
method was applied with effect sizes expressed as risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. 
This study is registered on PROSPERO with number CRD42017078611.
RESULTS: Out of 5,553 records, 8 RCTs were involved, providing data for 324 
immediately placed implants (immediate implants subjected to immediate loading 
[IPIL]: 163; immediate implants subjected to delayed loading [IPDL]: 161) that 
had been in function within 12 to 60 months. Meta-analyses revealed 
significantly lower midfacial mucosal level changes for IPIL compared with IPDL, 
pointing to 0.48 mm (95% CI: -0.84 to -0.12; P = .01), as well as more 
significant papillary recession after IPDL (SMD -0.16; 95% CI: -0.31 to 0.00; P 
= .04). The differences regarding implant survival and marginal bone loss 
between the two loading groups showed no statistical significance. The result of 
metaanalyses revealed similar plaque score (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.22 to 0.29; P = 
.79) and probing depth (SMD -0.09; 95% CI: -0.23 to 0.05; P = .21) for IPIL and 
IPDL. On the other hand, IPIL induced a trend toward more bleeding on probing 
(SMD 0.22; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.42; P = .04) and less change in facial ridge 
dimension (SMD 0.94; 95% CI: -1.49 to -0.39; P < .01).
CONCLUSION: After a follow-up ranging from 12 to 60 months, midfacial mucosa 
level change was 0.48 mm lower following IPIL compared with IPDL. Immediate 
implant placement and loading is conducive to the preservation of physiologic 
soft and hard tissue architecture, appearing to offer considerable benefits in 
the anterior zone. In summary, IPIL should be considered in the esthetic zone if 
the primary implant stability permits. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants

rich in growth factor (PRGF) mixed with bone grafts on ossification in the early 
period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 12 New Zealand male rabbits (weighing between 
approximately 2.5 to 3 kg) were included in this study. Subjects were randomly 
divided into two sets of groups: control and experiment. Autograft, DFDBA 
(demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft), and DBBM (deproteinized bovine bone 
mineral) were applied to different defects in the control groups, and autograft 
+ PRGF, DFDBA + PRGF, and DBBM + PRGF were applied in the experimental groups. 
All subjects were euthanized 28 days after surgery. The volumes of the bone, new 
connective tissue, and new capillaries were evaluated stereologically, and the 
bone density in the defects was investigated radiographically.
RESULTS: Regarding the stereologic evaluation, the volumes of the bone and 
capillaries were significantly higher in the experimental groups than in the 
control groups. In contrast, the connective tissue volume was considerably lower 
(P < .001, in all groups). Similarly, radiographic examinations showed that the 
bone density measurements in the experimental groups were higher than in the 
control groups. However, these differences were statistically significant only 
between the DFDBA + PRGF and DFDBA groups (P < .011).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence that the addition of PRGF to 
autograft, DFDBA, and DBBM enhances osteogenesis in the early period compared to 
using these grafts alone. It also accelerates the remodeling of connective 
tissue to bone in defects. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 2023;38:569-575. doi:

Finite Element Method.","Güzelce ES, Tokar E, Karacer Ö.","PURPOSE: To examine and compare stress values of implants, highest tensile and 
compressive values, and their distribution in cortical and trabecular bone near 
and around the implant region using different materials (aramid fiber, glass 
fiber, polyethylene fiber, carbon fiber, and cobalt-chromium [Co-Cr] alloy). 
Four dental implants were placed in the maxillary crest with two different 
location scenarios, and the 3D finite element analysis method was used to 
evaluate stress characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two maxillary models were created in which the implants 
were placed in different locations (lateral and first premolar, canine and 
second premolar). Four implant-supported overdenture prostheses were reinforced, 
applying Co-Cr alloy, glass fiber, aramid fiber, and carbon fiber. Static loads 
of 200 N were applied on the first molar region using the food stuff method. 
Stresses around the implants and denture-bearing areas and compression and 
tensile stresses on the cortical and trabecular bone were evaluated.
RESULTS: In all tested models, the highest von Mises stresses on implants and 
prostheses were observed in aramid fiber-reinforced overdentures. This was 
followed by glass fiber, Co-Cr alloy, and carbon fiber groups, respectively. It 
was observed that the lowest tensile and highest compression stress values in 
cortical and trabecular bone occurred in prostheses supported with carbon fiber. 
In all infrastructure materials, the design in which the implants were placed 
bilaterally in the lateral teeth and the first premolar region was found to be 
advantageous in terms of stress levels and distribution.
CONCLUSION: High elastic modulus fiber-reinforced overdenture prostheses 
transmitted less stress to implants and surrounding tissues than Co-Cr alloy. 
Anteriorly placed implant design illustrated lower stress values in the 
prosthesis, implant, and cortical and trabecular bone, and this placement design 
may increase the survival rates of both dental implants and overdentures. In 
light of this study, fibers can be recommended for clinical use and securely 
applied as an alternative material to metal support. Int J Oral Maxillofac

Implants: In Vitro Study.","Gargallo-Albiol J, Fischer NG, Aparicio C, Wang HL.","PURPOSE: To demonstrate the likelihood of the polyetheretherketone (PEEK), 
zirconia (ZrO2), and titanium (Ti) disks to support proliferation and 
hemidesmosome formation of gingival cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Water contact angle was performed on each material, and 
surface roughness (Ra) was measured. Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy were used. Later, oral keratinocyte cells were 
cultured on disks, and metabolic activity and expression of hemidesmosome 
markers, integrin α6 and β4, in relation to the biomaterial disks at 1, 3, and 5 
days of cell culture were quantified. Tissue culture polystyrene was used as the 
control. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
with Tukey post hoc comparison test. A P value of < .05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: The water contact angle ranged from 70.2 degrees (Ti) to a maximum of 
hydrophobicity of 93.3 degrees (PEEK). Ra was highest on ZrO2, followed by PEEK. 
Ti showed the most keratinocyte metabolic activity at 1, 3, and 5 culture 
periods. Contrarily, ZrO2 and PEEK disks had lower keratinocyte metabolic 
activity at all observation times, with no statistical differences between both 
groups. Integrin α6 and β4 expression was highest on TCPS and ZrO2 compared to 
Ti and PEEK.
CONCLUSION: Keratinocytes proliferated faster on Ti than on ZrO2 and PEEK 
substrates, and expression of hemidesmosome formation markers, integrin α6 and 
β4, were higher on ZrO2 than either Ti or PEEK. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants

Retrospective Study on 217 Implants with a Mean Follow-up of 4.1 Years.","Felice P, Bonifazi L, Pistilli R, Ferri A, Gasparro R, Barausse C.","PURPOSE: To assess whether the presence or absence of keratinized tissue height 
(KTh) may have an influence on marginal bone levels, complications, and implant 
survival for short implants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was designed as parallel cohort retrospective 
research. Short implants with an implant length < 7 mm were considered. One 
cohort was composed of patients with short implants surrounded by ≥ 2 mm of KTh 
(adequate KTh); the other cohort included implants with < 2 mm of KTh 
(not-adequate KTh). Outcome measures were marginal bone level (MBL) changes, 
failures, and complications.
RESULTS: One hundred ten patients treated with 217 short and extrashort implants 
(4 to 6.6 mm long) were retrospectively included. The mean follow-up was 4.1 
years after prosthetic loading (range: 1 to 8 years). The differences between 
KTh groups in MBL were not statistically significant at every follow-up 
considered: 0.05 mm at 1 year (P = .48), 0.06 mm at 3 years (P = .34), 0.04 mm 
at 5 years (P = .64), and 0.03 at 8 years (P = .82). A total of nine 
complications were reported: three in the not-adequate KTh group and six in the 
adequate group; the difference was not statistically significant (OR: 3.03, 95% 
CI: 0.68 to 13.46, P = .14). Five implants failed due to peri-implantitis, two 
in the not-adequate KTh group and three in the adequate group, without a 
statistically significant difference (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 0.42-17.99, P = .29).
CONCLUSION: This study showed no statistically significant differences in MBL, 
complications, and implant failure rates between short implants with adequate or 
not-adequate KThs. However, given the importance of patient comfort while 
brushing and plaque accumulation, keratinized tissue grafts could be important 
in selected patients, especially for those who are severely atrophic, also 
taking into consideration all the limitations of this study and the mediumterm 
follow-up. Nevertheless, longer follow-ups, larger numbers of patients, and

Socket Therapy Versus Partial Extraction Therapy in the Esthetic Zone: A 
Randomized Clinical Trial.","Elaskary A, Abdelrahman H, Elfahl B, Elsabagh H, El-Kimary G, Ghallab NA.","PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial aimed to assess esthetic and soft and 
hard tissue outcomes 6 months after immediate implant placement using vestibular 
socket therapy (VST) (test) versus partial extraction therapy (comparator) in 
intact thin-walled fresh extraction sockets in the esthetic zone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with hopeless maxillary anterior 
teeth requiring immediate implant placement were randomly assigned to two equal 
groups to receive either VST or partial extraction therapy. Definitive 
restorations were delivered after 3 months. Pink esthetic scores (PESs) and 
vertical soft tissue alterations in millimeters were measured 6 months after 
restoration using intraoral digital scans of the distal papilla, midfacial 
gingival margin, and mesial papilla. Facial bone thickness was measured using 
CBCT scans at baseline and after 6 months. Implant survival and peri-implant 
pocket depth were assessed.
RESULTS: Both groups showed 100% implant survival after 6 months. The overall 
PESs after 6 months were 12.67 (± 1.3) in the VST group, while the partial 
extraction therapy group score was 13.17 (± 1.19), with no significant 
difference between them (P = .02). The mean (± SD) vertical soft tissue 
measurements for the VST group were 0.08 (± 0.55), 0.01 (± 0.73), and -0.03 (± 
0.52) mm, and for the partial extraction therapy group, they were -0.24 (± 0.25) 
mm, -0.20 (± 0.10) mm, and -0.34 (± 0.13) mm for the mesial papilla, midfacial 
gingival margin, and distal papilla, respectively. No significant differences 
were observed between the groups at any of the reference points (P ± .05). Both 
techniques demonstrated a significant gain in millimeters of labial bone 
thickness after 6 months compared to baseline (P ± .05). Regarding VST, the 
apical, middle, and crestal mean bone gain was 1.68 (±± 2.73), 1.62 (±± 1.35), 
and 1.33 (±± 1.22) mm, respectively, while partial extraction therapy showed 
0.58 (± 0.62), 1.27 (± 1.22), and 1.53 (± 1.24) mm, respectively, with no 
significant difference detected between them (P ≥ .05). Additionally, the mean 
(± SD) peri-implant pocket depth after 6 months for VST was 2.16 (± 0.44) and 
2.08 (± 1.02) mm for partial extraction therapy with no significant difference 
between them (P = .79).
CONCLUSION: This investigation suggests that both VST and partial extraction 
therapy preserved alveolar bone structure and peri-implant tissues following 
immediate implants. The novel VST might be considered a predictable alternative 
treatment approach for immediate implant placement in intact thin-walled fresh 
extraction sockets in the esthetic zone. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants

Transepithelial Component on Implant-Abutment Connection Microgap: An In Vitro 
Study with In Situ Hard X-Ray Radiography.","Armentia M, Abasolo M, Coria I, Zabler S.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of implant body diameter, platform diameter, and 
the use of transepithelial components on implant-abutment connection (IAC) 
microgap width.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 16 tests were performed on four commercial 
dental restoration models (BTI Biotechnology Institute). Different static loads 
were applied to the embedded implants according to the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14801, using a customized loading device. 
Measurements of the microgap were taken by means of highly magnified x-ray 
projection in situ in a micro-CT scanner. Regression models were obtained and 
compared through an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). To quantify the effect of 
each variable, t tests (α = .05) of experimental results were performed.
RESULTS: Under 400 N, using a transepithelial component for the dental 
restoration, the microgap width was reduced by 20% (P = .044). Meanwhile, a 22% 
microgap reduction was observed when the implant body diameter was increased by 
1 mm (P = .024). Finally, increasing the platform diameter by 1.4 mm led to a 
microgap reduction of 54% (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: The use of a transepithelial component in dental restorations 
reduces the microgap width in IACs. Furthermore, given sufficient space for the 
implantation, larger implant bodies and platform diameters can also be used for 
this purpose. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 2023;38:489-495. doi:

Versus Titanium Mesh: A Clinical and Histologic Randomized Comparative Study.","Abaza AWAAB, Abbas WM, Khalik DMA, El Din NHK.","PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of maxillary horizontal alveolar ridge 
augmentation in the esthetic area, using either pericardium membrane or titanium 
mesh, clinically, radiographically, and histologically.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized clinical study was performed on 20 patients 
with insufficient edentulous ridge width. Subjects were equally allocated into 
two groups. For both groups, autogenous tenting bone blocks were harvested from 
the symphysis area. Bone block was covered by an equal mixture (1:1) of 
particulate graft of inorganic bovine bone and autogenous bone matrix. The 
barrier membrane used in group 1 (PM) was bovine pericardium membrane, and in 
group 2 (TM), it was titanium mesh.
RESULTS: Both groups had a clinically statistically significant difference in 
buccopalatal alveolar ridge dimension between baseline and after 4 months. 
Radiographically, at both intervals, there was no significant difference in 3D 
volume between both groups. Within both groups, there was a significant volume 
increase postoperatively. Histologically, the PM group had a lower area fraction 
of the mean value of newly formed bone than the TM group, yet the difference was 
not significant. The PM group had a higher mean osteocyte count than the TM 
group, but again, the difference was not significant.
CONCLUSION: Guided bone regeneration using either pericardium membrane or 
titanium mesh is a reliable treatment for horizontal augmentation of 
insufficient maxillary alveolar ridge width. No significant differences between 
both treatment modalities were noticed clinically and histologically. However, 
percentage change in radiographic volumetric measurements using TM was 
significantly higher than that of PM. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants

is similar to a clip, which improves the convenience of donning/doffing and 
connection stability. The elastomer-based clutched series elastic actuator can 
limit the maximum transmission torque and improve passive safety. Second, the 
kinematic compatibility of the exoskeleton mechanism for the proximal 
interphalangeal joint is analyzed, and its kineto-statics model is built. To 
avoid the damage caused by the force along the phalanx, considering the 
individual difference in the size of the finger segment, a two-level 
optimization method is proposed to minimize the force along the phalanx. 
Finally, the performance of the proposed index finger exoskeleton is tested. 
Statistical results indicate that the donning/doffing time of the semi-wrapped 
fixture is significantly less than that of the Velcro. Compared with the Velcro, 
the average value of the maximum relative displacement between the fixture and 
the phalanx is reduced by 59.7%. Compared with the exoskeleton before 
optimization, the maximum force along the phalanx generated by the exoskeleton 
after optimization is reduced by 23.65%. The experimental results show that the

temporal information to reconstruct stimulus images than other technologies that 
can be used to measure the human brain's neural responses. The fMRI scans, 
however, generally show heterogeneity among different subjects. The majority of 
the existing methods aim primarily at mining correlations between stimuli and 
evoked brain activity, disregarding the heterogeneity among subjects. Therefore, 
this heterogeneity will impair the reliability and applicability of 
multi-subject decoding results, leading to sub-optimal results. The present 
paper proposes the functional alignment-auxiliary generative adversarial network 
(FAA-GAN) as a novel multi-subject approach for visual image reconstruction that 
employs functional alignment to alleviate the heterogeneity between subjects. 
Our proposed FAA-GAN includes three key components: 1) a generative adversarial 
network (GAN) module for reconstructing visual stimuli, which consists of a 
visual image encoder as the generator that uses a nonlinear network to convert 
stimuli images into an implicit representation and a discriminator that 
generates the images comparable to the original images in detail; 2) a 
multi-subject functional alignment module, which is used to precisely align the 
individual fMRI response space of each subject in a common space to reduce the 
heterogeneity among different subjects; and 3) a cross-modal hashing retrieval 
module used for similarity retrieval of two modalities of data, i.e., the visual 
images and the evoked brain responses. Experiments on real-world datasets show 
that our FAA-GAN method does better than other state-of-the-art deep

pixel into either base classes with abundant training examples or novel classes 
with only a handful of (e. g., 1-5) training images per class. Compared to the 
widely studied Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS), which is limited to 
segmenting novel classes only, GFSS is much under-studied despite being more 
practical. Existing approach to GFSS is based on classifier parameter fusion 
whereby a newly trained novel class classifier and a pre-trained base class 
classifier are combined to form a new classifier. As the training data is 
dominated by base classes, this approach is inevitably biased towards the base 
classes. In this work, we propose a novel Prediction Calibration Network (PCN) 
to address this problem. Instead of fusing the classifier parameters, we fuse 
the scores produced separately by the base and novel classifiers. To ensure that 
the fused scores are not biased to either the base or novel classes, a new 
Transformer-based calibration module is introduced. It is known that the 
lower-level features are useful of detecting edge information in an input image 
than higher-level features. Thus, we build a cross-attention module that guides 
the classifier's final prediction using the fused multi-level features. However, 
transformers are computationally demanding. Crucially, to make the proposed 
cross-attention module training tractable at the pixel level, this module is 
designed based on feature-score cross-covariance and episodically trained to be 
generalizable at inference time. Extensive experiments on PASCAL- 5i and COCO-

Penalty Function.","Zhang H, Fan H, Li Y, Liu X, Liu C, Zhu X.","Non-convex relaxation methods have been widely used in tensor recovery problems, 
compared with convex relaxation methods, and can achieve better recovery 
results. In this paper, a new non-convex function, Minimax Logarithmic Concave 
Penalty (MLCP) function, is proposed, and some of its intrinsic properties are 
analyzed, among which it is interesting to find that the Logarithmic function is 
an upper bound of the MLCP function. The proposed function is generalized to 
tensor cases, yielding tensor MLCP and weighted tensor Lγ -norm. Consider that 
its explicit solution cannot be obtained when applying it directly to the tensor 
recovery problem. Therefore, the corresponding equivalence theorems to solve the 
such problem are given, namely, tensor equivalent MLCP theorem and equivalent 
weighted tensor Lγ -norm theorem. In addition, we propose two EMLCP-based models 
for classic tensor recovery problems, namely low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) 
and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA), and design proximal 
alternate linearization minimization (PALM) algorithms to solve them 
individually. Furthermore, based on the Kurdyka-Åasiwicz property, it is proved 
that the solution sequence of the proposed algorithm has a finite length and 
converges to the critical point globally. Finally, extensive experiments show 
that the proposed algorithm achieves good results, and it is confirmed that the 
MLCP function is indeed better than the Logarithmic function in the minimization 
problem, which is consistent with the analysis of theoretical properties.","DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2023.3282072

Consequently, the development of methods to assess the quality of real-time

Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment.","Boukhennoufa I, Jarchi D, Zhai X, Utti V, Sanei S, Lee TKM, Jackson J, 
McDonald-Maier KD.","The application of machine learning-based tele-rehabilitation faces the 
challenge of limited availability of data. To overcome this challenge, data 
augmentation techniques are commonly employed to generate synthetic data that 
reflect the configurations of real data. One such promising data augmentation 
technique is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, GANs have been 
found to suffer from mode collapse, a common issue where the generated data 
fails to capture all the relevant information from the original dataset. In this 
paper, we aim to address the problem of mode collapse in GAN-based data 
augmentation techniques for post-stroke assessment. We applied the GAN to 
generate synthetic data for two post-stroke rehabilitation datasets and observed 
that the original GAN suffered from mode collapse, as expected. To address this 
issue, we propose a Time Series Siamese GAN (TS-SGAN) that incorporates a 
Siamese network and an additional discriminator. Our analysis, using the longest 
common sub-sequence (LCSS), demonstrates that TS-SGAN generates data uniformly 
for all elements of two testing datasets, in contrast to the original GAN. To 
further evaluate the effectiveness of TS-SGAN, we encode the generated dataset 
into images using Gramian Angular Field and classify them using ResNet-18. Our 
results show that TS-SGAN achieves a significant accuracy increase of 
classification accuracy (35.2%-42.07%) for both selected datasets. This 
represents a substantial improvement over the original GAN.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3283045

Invariance.","Zheng K, Wu J, Zhang J, Guo C.","Automated exercise assessment is of great importance for patients under 
rehabilitation exercise who require professional guidance. Among the existing 
approaches, the skeleton-based assessment model that classifies the correctness 
of the exercise has attracted much attention due to its relative ease of 
implementation and convenience in use. However, there are two problems with this 
approach. The first problem is its sensitivity to the orientation of the human 
skeleton. To solve this problem, we propose a novel rotation-invariant 
descriptor, the dot product matrix of the human skeleton, and prove 
mathematically that this descriptor discards only the orientation message that 
we do not expect while preserving all other useful information. Lack of feedback 
from the system is the second problem, because the exercisers do not know which 
parts of their exercises are incorrect. Therefore, we develop a visualization 
method for our system based on Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping 
(Grad-CAM) and an quantitative metric called Overlap Ratio (OvR) to measure the 
quality of the visualization result. To demonstrate the effect of our method, we 
conduct experiments on two public datasets and a self-generated push-up dataset. 
The experimental results show that our rotation-invariant descriptor can achieve 
absolute robustness to orientation even under severe angle perturbations. In 
terms of accuracy and OvR, our method even outperforms previous works in most 
cases, indicating that the rotation-invariant descriptor helps the assessment 
model to extract more stable features. The visualization results are also 
informative to correct the movements; some examples are presented in this paper. 
The code of this paper and our push-up dataset are publicly available at

Ratio of Individuals With Lower-Limb Amputation: A Pilot Study.","Escamilla-Nunez R, Gouda A, Andrysek J.","Individuals with lower-limb amputation (LLA) often exhibit atypical gait 
patterns and asymmetries. These patterns can be corrected using biofeedback 
(BFB). Real-time BFB strategies have demonstrated to be effective to various 
degrees in BFB systems. However, no studies have evaluated the use of corrective 
vibrotactile BFB strategies to improve temporal gait symmetry of LLA. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate a wearable vibrotactile BFB system to improve stance 
time symmetry ratio (STSR) of LLA, and compare two corrective BFB strategies 
that activate either one or two vibrating motors at two different frequency and 
amplitude levels, based on a pre-set STSR target. Gait patterns of five 
unilateral LLA were assessed with and without BFB. Spatiotemporal and kinematic 
gait parameters were measured and assessed using a wearable motion capture 
system. Usability and workload were assessed using the System Usability Scale 
and NASA Task Load Index questionnaires, respectively. Results showed that 
participants significantly ( [Formula: see text]) improved STSR with BFB; 
however, this coincided with a reduction in gait speed and cadence compared to 
walking without feedback. Knee and hip flexion angles improved and changes in 
other parameters were variable. Immediate post-test retention effects were 
observed, suggesting that gait changes due to BFB were preserved for at least a 
short-time after feedback was withdrawn. System usability was found to be 
acceptable while using BFB. The outcomes of this study provide new insights into
