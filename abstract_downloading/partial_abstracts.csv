Online  ahead of print.",Dental Diode Lasers for Implant Uncovering: A Case Series.,"Estrin NE, Romanos GE.","Diode lasers are increasingly being utilized as an alternative to conventional 
soft tissue surgery. While originally diode lasers referred to wavelengths 
ranging from 810 through 980 nm, a visible diode laser with a 445-nm wavelength 
has emerged as an additional wavelength for soft tissue surgery. The goal of 
this case series was to demonstrate the clinical results of both visible and 
near infrared (NIR) wavelengths when utilized for second stage implant surgery. 
Ten patients with 23 implants were treated at Stony Brook University, Department 
of Periodontology for implant uncovering using both visible and nonvisible (NIR) 
diode lasers. The uncovering was done utilizing 445-nm, 970-nm, and 980-nm 
wavelengths at a power setting of 2 W in either continuous or pulsed modes. The 
fiber-optic tips were initiated using blue articulating paper. Either topical 
benzocaine or infiltration anesthesia was utilized prior to soft tissue removal 
with the initiated tip. All patients healed uneventfully without any 
postoperative complications. Visible and NIR diode lasers provide an alternative 
and safe method to uncover submerged at implants at second stage surgery.","DOI: 10.11607/prd.5870

(CBCT) images captured between November 2019 and April 2021 on patients who 
underwent dental implant placement and had a periodontal charting. The buccal

three measurements taken from the buccal and lingual aspects of implants. 
Implants with peri-implantitis were placed in group 1 while implants with 
peri-implant mucositis or peri-implant health were placed in group 2. A Wilcoxon 
Rank-Sum test was used to compare the differences between the bone thickness 
between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 93 CBCT radiographs were screened, 
resulting in the analysis of 15 CBCT images that contained both a dental implant 
and a corresponding periodontal charting. Of the 15 dental implants examined, 
five implants presented with peri-implantitis, one with peri-implant mucositis 
and nine with peri-implant health, rendering a percentage of patients with 
peri-implantitis at 33%. Within the limitations of this study, buccal bone 
thickness averaging ≥1.10 mm or midlingual probing depths (PDs) ≤3.4 mm

longer than 10 years. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the long-term 
outcomes of the short locking-taper implants supporting single crowns in the 
posterior region. Patients who received short locking-taper implants (≤ 8 mm) 
supporting single crowns in the posterior region from 2008 to 2010 were 
included. The clinical outcomes, radiographic outcomes, and patient satisfaction 
were recorded. As a result, a total of 18 patients with 34 implants were 
included. The cumulative survival rate was 91.4% and 83.3% at implant level and 
patient level, respectively. Tooth brush habit and history of periodontitis were 
significantly associated with implant failure (P < .05). The median marginal 
bone loss (MBL) was 0.24 mm (interquartile range: 0.01 to 0.98). Biologic and 
technical complications occurred in 14.7% and 17.8% implants, respectively. The 
mean modified sulcus bleeding index and mean peri-implant probing depths were 
0.52 ± 0.63 and 2.38 ± 0.79 mm, respectively. All patients were at least quite 
satisfied, with the majority of patients being fully satisfied (88.9%) with the

peri-implant soft tissue dehiscences, there are other esthetic concerns in 
routine clinical practice that require investigation and treatment. Against this 
backdrop, this report on two clinical cases aimed to describe a surgical 
approach using the apical access technique for treatment of peri-implant soft 
tissue discoloration and fenestration. In both clinical scenarios the defect was 
accessed via a single horizontal apical incision, without removing the 
cement-retained crowns. A bilaminar technique using apical access with a 
simultaneous connective tissue graft seems to offer promising results for the 
treatment of peri-implant soft tissue deformities. After the 12-month

on 156 Implants with a 5- to 14-Year Follow-up.","Tironi F, Orlando F, Azzola F, Vitelli C, Francetti LA.","The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the performance of implants 
placed with the All-on-4 technique after a mean time in function of 9 years. 
Thirty-four patients treated with 156 implants were selected for this study. 
Eighteen patients underwent teeth extraction on the day of implant placement 
(group D); 16 were already edentulous (group E). A peri-apical radiograph was 
taken after a mean of 9 years (range: 5 to 14 years). Success, survival rate, 
and prevalence of peri-implantitis were calculated. Statistical analysis was 
used to assess comparisons between groups. After a mean follow-up time of 9 
years, the cumulative survival rate was 97.4%, and the success rate was 77.4%. 
The difference between initial and final radiographs resulted in a mean marginal 
bone loss (MBL) of 1.3 ± 1.06 mm (range: 0.1 to 5.3 mm). No differences were 
shown between group D and group E. Fifteen (9.6%) implants in 9 (26.5%) patients 
were affected by peri-implantitis. This study shows that the All-on-4 technique 
is a reliable treatment for both edentulous patients and patients that need to 
undergo dental extractions, with a long follow up. MBL found in this study is 
similar to MBL around implants used in other rehabilitation types.","DOI: 10.11607/prd.6013

Design and a Digital Integrated Workflow: A Case Series.","Pariente L, Dada K, Linder S, Dard M.","The purpose of this case series was to assess the application of a novel 
self-cutting, tapered implant (Straumann® BLX, Institut Straumann AG, Basel, 
Switzerland) in combination with a digital integrated prosthetic workflow for 
the immediate placement and restoration. Fourteen consecutive patients, 
requiring replacement of a single hopeless maxillary or mandibular tooth, 
meeting the clinical and radiographic indication criteria for immediate implant 
placement, were treated. All cases followed the same digitally-guided procedure 
of extraction and immediate implant placement. Immediate temporization with full 
contoured screw-retained provisionals was performed using an integrated digital 
workflow. After implant placement and dual-zone bone and soft tissue 
augmentation, connecting geometries and emergence profiles were finalized. The 
average implant insertion torque was 53.2 ± 14.9 Ncm and ranged between 35 and 
80 Ncm, allowing immediate provisional restoration in all cases. Final 
restorations were delivered three months after implant placement. An implant 
survival rate of 100% was observed at the 1-year recall after loading. The 
results of this case series suggest that immediate placement of novel tapered 
implants and immediate provisionalization using an integrated digital workflow 
can result in predictable functional and esthetic results for the immediate 
transition of failing single teeth in the esthetic area.","DOI: 10.11607/prd.5313

orthodontic extrusion with the Tissue Master Concept to retain subgingivally 
fractured teeth as abutments for which extraction and replacement would be equal 
treatment opportunities. Participants were recruited from a group of consecutive 
patients in need of prosthodontic rehabilitation. Thirty-six deeply destroyed 
teeth in 31 patients underwent forced orthodontic extrusion with forces 
exceeding 50g in order to re-establish biologic width and ensure a 
2mm-dentin-ferrule design prior to single-crown restoration. The primary 
endpoint was the success of the extrusion in terms of the ability to restore the 
respective abutment tooth. Information about overall-treatment time, frequency 
and reasons of failure was collected. Four patients aborted treatment. For the 
remaining 27 participants data were fully collected. The amount of extrusion 
ranged between 2 and 6mm (mean: 3.5; SD: ± 0.9) and the mean duration until 
retention was 20 (SD ± 12) days. On average, patients returned three (SD: ± 3) 
times for control visits within time of extrusion. Adhesive failure (n=6) and 
orthodontic relapse (n=2) were the most frequent types of complication. Forced 
orthodontic extrusion may be an useful tool to restore teeth evaluated as 
unrestorable.","DOI: 10.11607/prd.6155

A Feasibility Clinical Trial.","Shakibaie B, Blatz MB, Sabri H, Jamnani ED, Barootchi S.","Xenogeneic-derived biomaterials are among the most routinely employed bone 
substitutes for immediate grafting of extraction sites as a modality of alveolar 
ridge preservation (ARP). The deproteinized bovine bone material is an example 
of which is widely used and documented by many around the world. The present 
pilot clinical trial aimed at evaluating and comparing the clinical and 
morphological alterations of extraction sites after ARP, using two commercially 
available differently processed bovine bone grafts. Twenty adjacent extraction 
sites in ten patients were included. All sites received the exact same ARP 
therapy, except for the specific type of bovine bone graft which was randomly 
assigned between two adjacent extraction sockets in 10 patients (group A 
receiving Bio-Oss particles, and group B receiving Cerabone particles). The 
healing at all sites was monitored throughout the process at equal intervals, at 
time of surgery, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months and 4 months post operatively. All 
the augmented extraction sites successfully received implant therapy regardless 
of the type of bone graft material that was used for the ARP. And 6 weeks later, 
second stage/uncovery procedures were performed without complications. 
Inter-group comparisons of Crestal gingiva healing process (CGHP), Mean 
Transversal crestal ridge resorption (MTRR), and the Mean implant primary 
stability (MIPS) were in favor of site that were allocated to group A (treatment 
with Bio-Oss particles).","DOI: 10.11607/prd.6128

retrospective clinical study.","Tagger-Green N, Nemcovski C, Fridenberg N, Berg YS, Kolerman R.","BACKGROUND: Work in animal models has implicated excessive occlusal forces and 
occlusal trauma as co-destructive factors for periodontitis. The main aim of the 
present study was to make a radiographic assessment of the effects of excessive 
occlusal forces i.e. occlusal/incisal tooth wear (TW), widening of the 
periodontal space (PDLw), and the presence of a mandibular torus (TM), on 
interproximal marginal bone loss (MBL) in a large series of patients. A 
secondary aim was to evaluate the statistical correlation between the parameters 
in specific two teeth and those of 12 teeth for MBL and six teeth for TW within 
the same individual.
METHODS: A total of 1950 full-mouth radiographic surveys were analyzed 
retrospectively. MBL was quantified relative to the root length (""Schei's ruler 
technique""). In addition, TW and PDL widening of the periodontal space were 
assessed, as well as the presence of TM. Odds ratio and logistic regression 
analysis were used to determine the association between occlusal trauma and MBL.
RESULTS: The correlation of the measured parameters between the values for 
specific teeth and the whole dentition was evaluated from data from the first 
400 radiographs. Teeth 41 and 33 showed the best correlation to the whole 
dentition: 0.85 for MBL, 0.83 for PDLw, and 0.97 for TW. The results of a 
logistic regression analysis with age as an independent variable, revealed a 
significant association between bone loss and both tooth wear (OR=2.767) and 
bone loss and PDLw (OR=2.585).
CONCLUSION: TW is positively correlated to both PDLw and MBL. No correlation was 
found between the presence of TM and MBL.","DOI: 10.3290/j.qi.b4170135

A, Banach M, Mordaka R, Chudzik M.","INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have indicated that after COVID-19, symptoms can 
persist for up to 12 months after recovery; however, the data on this are still 
limited.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, the most common 
symptoms, and the risk factors for the development of post-COVID syndrome in 
hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients during a 12-month follow-up period 
after recovery COVID-19.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This longitudinal study was based on medical data 
collected during visits 3 and 12 months after COVID-19 infection. 
Sociodemographic data, chronic conditions, and the most common clinical symptoms 
at 3 and 12 months after the disease were assessed during visits. 643 patients 
were enrolled in the final analysis.
RESULTS: The majority of the study group were women (63.1%), and the median age 
was 52 years. During the analysis of the clinical picture, after 12 months, 
65.7% (62.1% - 69.6%) of patients declared the presence of at least one clinical 
symptom of post-COVID syndrome. The most common complaints were asthenia - 45.7% 
(41.9% - 49.6%) of patients, and neurocognitive symptoms - 40.0% (36.0% - 40.1%) 
of patients. In a multivariable analysis, female sex (OR 1.49, p=0.01) and 
severe COVID-19 infection (OR 3.05, p<0.001) were associated with the 
persistence of clinical symptoms up to 12 months after recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: After 12 months, persistent symptoms were declared by 65.7% of 
patients. The most common symptoms 3 and 12 months after infection are worse 
tolerance to exercise, fatigue, palpitations, and memory or concentration 
problems. Females are at higher risk of experiencing persistent symptoms, and 
COVID-19 severity was a predictor of persistent post-COVID symptoms.","DOI: 10.20452/pamw.16512

Reducing Oral Candida Carriage and Periodontal Inflammation in Cigarette Smokers 
and Non-smokers after Non-surgical Periodontal Therapy.","Basudan AM, Al-Zawawi AS, Divakar DD, Shaheen MY, Aldulaijan HA.","PURPOSE: The present study assessed the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) 
and Salvadora persica-based mouthwashes (SPM) in reducing oral Candida carriage 
(OCC) and periodontal inflammation in cigarette smokers and non-smokers after 
non-surgical periodontal treatment (NSPT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self-reported cigarette smokers and non-smokers with 
periodontal inflammation as well as non-smokers with a healthy periodontal 
status were included. NSPT was performed in all participants. Based on the type 
of mouthwash, participants were randomly divided into three groups as follows: 
group 1: CHX; group 2: SPM; and group 3: distilled water (ddH2O) with mint 
flavour (control group). Clinical attachment loss (CAL), plaque index (PI), 
gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and marginal bone loss (MBL) were 
measured. Clinical periodontal parameters were re-assessed at a 6-week 
follow-up. Oral yeast samples were collected and identified using a concentrated 
oral-rinse culture technique and PCR, respectively. Clinical and 
laboratory-based investigations were done at baseline and after six weeks. 
Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: At baseline, PI, MBL, PD and CAL were comparable in all participants. 
None of the patients had periodontitis at baseline. Post-operatively, CHX and 
SPM were more effective in reducing PI (p < 0.01), GI (p < 0.01) and PD (p < 
0.01) in non-smokers than in the control group. The OCC was statistically 
significantly higher among smokers compared with non-smokers at baseline. At the 
6-month follow-up, CHX was more effective than SPM in reducing OCC in 
non-smokers (p < 0.01). At the 6-week follow-up, there was no difference in OCC 
among cigarette smokers regardless of the type of mouthwash prescribed 
postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: In cigarette smokers and non-smokers, CHX and SPM are effective in 
reducing periodontal soft-tissue inflammation after NSPT. Post-operative use of 
CHX is more effective than SPM in reducing OCC.","DOI: 10.3290/j.ohpd.b4169713

(CGA) and multidisciplinary treatment followed by a nurse-guided transitional 
care bridge program in 100 hospitalized older adults. In the intervention group, 
CGA and multidisciplinary care were performed. The control group was provided 
with guideline-associated treatment. Study outcomes comprised the 6-month Katz 
Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score, Lawton 
Instrumental ADL (IADL) score, and unplanned hospital readmission rate. There 
were no differences in mean 6-month Katz ADL scores between intervention and 
control groups; however, significant differences were found between groups in 
IADL score and unplanned hospital readmission rate. CGA followed by nurse-guided 
transitional care stabilized patients' IADL score and improved hospital 
readmission rate. The current results informed that combining CGA with 
multidisciplinary continuous nursing is an effective and feasible working 
pattern; however, more exploratory work is needed. [Research in Gerontological

extent to which an intervention is provided as intended) in the Family-Centered 
Function-Focused Care (Fam-FFC) intervention. This was a descriptive study using 
data collected during intervention activities throughout the course of the 
Fam-FFC study. Specific measures included Environment and Policy Assessments, 
Fam-FFC Knowledge Test, Goal Attainment Scale, Function-Focused Care Behavior 
Checklist, and completion of the FamPath Audit. Delivery was provided as 
intended. Staff demonstrated intervention skills with only one Fam-FFC research 
nurse needing retraining. Receipt was based on Fam-FFC Knowledge Test scores 
>80%, with the majority of participants reporting goal achievement as expected 
or higher than expected and slight improvement in environments and policies to 
better support Fam-FFC. Lastly, enactment was based on evidence that in 67% of 
observations staff provided at least one function-focused care intervention. 
Findings from this study will be used to adapt the intervention to reach all 
staff, increase ways to change environments and policies, consider ways to more 
comprehensively evaluate enactment of function-focused care during real-world 
interactions, and consider the characteristics of nursing staff and whether a 
relationship exists between staff characteristics and providing function-focused 
care. [Research in Gerontological Nursing, xx(x), xx-xx.].","DOI: 10.3928/19404921-20230606-01

relationship between perceived needs of older adults living in publicly 
supported housing and loneliness. Participants were males and females aged 70 to 
83 years who identified as White or Chinese. Using the Camberwell Assessment of 
Need Short Appraisal Schedule and UCLA Loneliness Scale, the relationship 
between residents' needs and loneliness was assessed to guide the development of 
interventions. Results revealed residents self-reported 54% of their needs were 
met and rated their loneliness at a score of 36.5 (moderate level). Furthermore, 
there was a medium positive correlation between unmet needs and loneliness 
whereby high unmet needs were associated with higher loneliness scores. Findings 
suggest that these older adults living in publicly supported housing are 
vulnerable to the negative consequences of loneliness. Implementing equitable 
and inclusive interventions to address the impact of loneliness in the context 
of social determinants of health is warranted. [Research in Gerontological

Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.","Kim J, Cuevas H, Wood ST.","The purpose of the current systematic review was to examine the effects of music 
interventions on cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). A systematic search of CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of 
Science databases was performed. Studies examining the effects of music 
interventions on cognitive function in older adults with MCI were included. 
Narrative synthesis for cognitive outcomes postintervention was performed. A 
total of 11 articles met inclusion criteria. Music interventions significantly 
improved global cognitive function, verbal fluency, executive function, and 
spatial function in older adults with MCI. Included studies were heterogeneous 
in terms of the type of intervention, cognitive assessment tool, and 
intervention duration. Six studies were at risk of bias due to missing data and 
confounding factors. Our findings suggest that music interventions can be an 
effective strategy to improve cognitive function for older adults with MCI. 
However, findings should be interpreted with caution. More rigorous studies with 
various types of music interventions investigating cognitive domain-specific 
effects are needed. [Research in Gerontological Nursing, xx(x), xx-xx.].","DOI: 10.3928/19404921-20230609-01

Spin Echo (SATE).","Guan H, Feng T, Wang M, Ma M, Yong X, Chen W, Zhang S, Zhang Y.","The measurements of magnetic flux density ( Bz) needed in magnetic resonance 
electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) and magnetic resonance current density 
imaging (MRCDI) techniques often utilize spin echo (SE)-based sequences for data 
acquisition. The low imaging speed of SE-based methods significantly hampers the 
clinical applications of MREIT and MRCDI. Here, we propose a new sequence for 
substantially accelerating the acquisition of Bz measurements. A skip-echo 
acquired turbo spin echo (SATE) imaging sequence based on the conventional turbo 
spin echo (TSE) technique was proposed by adding a skip-echo module in front of 
the TSE acquisition module. The skip-echo module consisted of a series of 
refocusing pulses without acquisition. In SATE, amplitude-modulated crusher 
gradients were used to remove the stimulated echo pathways, and the 
radiofrequency (RF) pulse shape was specially selected to preserve more signals. 
In efficiency evaluation experiments performed on a spherical gel phantom, we 
demonstrated that SATE had improved measurement efficiency compared to the 
conventional TSE sequence via skipping one echo before acquiring signals. The 
accuracy of the Bz measurements by SATE was validated against those by the 
multi-echo injection current nonlinear encoding (ME-ICNE) method, while SATE was 
able to accelerate the data acquisition up to 10-fold. Volumetric coverage of Bz 
maps obtained in the phantom, pork, and human calf illustrated that SATE can 
reliably measure volumetric Bz distributions within clinically acceptable time. 
The proposed SATE sequence provides a fast and effective approach for volumetric

sequential demosaicking contain the idea of computational photography, where the 
CFA and the demosaicking method are co-designed. Due to the advantages, 
interpolation-friendly RGBW CFAs have been extensively used in commercial color 
cameras. However, most associated demosaicking methods rely on strict 
assumptions or are limited to a few specific CFAs with a given camera. In this 
paper, we propose a universal demosaicking method for interpolation-friendly 
RGBW CFAs, which enables the comparison of different CFAs. Our new method 
belongs to sequential demosaicking, i.e., W channel is interpolated first and 
then RGB channels are reconstructed with guidance from the interpolated W 
channel. Specifically, it first interpolates the W channel using only available 
W pixels followed by an aliasing reduction technique to remove aliasing 
artifacts. Then it employs an image decomposition model to built relations 
between W channel and each of RGB channels with known RGB values, which can be 
easily generalized to the full-size demosaicked image. We apply the linearized 
alternating direction method (LADM) to solve it with convergence guarantee. Our 
demosaicking method can be applied to all interpolation-friendly RGBW CFAs with 
varying color cameras and lighting conditions. Extensive experiments confirm the 
universal property and advantage of our proposed method with both simulated and 
real raw images.","DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2023.3286253

Video Coding.","Man H, Fan X, Xiong R, Zhao D.","Intra prediction is a crucial part of video compression, which utilizes local 
information in images to eliminate spatial redundancy. As the state-of-the-art 
video coding standard, Versatile Video Coding (H.266/VVC) employs multiple 
directional prediction modes in intra prediction to find the texture trend of 
local areas. Then the prediction is made based on reference samples in the 
selected direction. Recently, neural network-based intra prediction has achieved 
great success. Deep network models are trained and applied to assist the HEVC 
and VVC intra modes. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-structured data 
clustering-driven neural network (dubbed TreeNet) for intra prediction, which 
builds the networks and clusters the training data in a tree-structured manner. 
Specifically, in each network split and training process of TreeNet, every 
parent network on a leaf node is split into two child networks by adding or 
subtracting Gaussian random noise. Then data clustering-driven training is 
applied to train the two derived child networks using the clustered training 
data of their parent. On the one hand, the networks at the same level in TreeNet 
are trained with non-overlapping clustered datasets, and thus they can learn 
different prediction abilities. On the other hand, the networks at different 
levels are trained with hierarchically clustered datasets, and thus they will 
have different generalization abilities. TreeNet is integrated into VVC to 
assist or replace intra prediction modes to test its performance. In addition, a 
fast termination strategy is proposed to accelerate the search of TreeNet. The 
experimental results demonstrate that when TreeNet is used to assist the VVC 
Intra modes, TreeNet with depth = 3 can bring an average of 3.78% bitrate saving 
(up to 8.12%) over VTM-17.0. If TreeNet with the same depth replaces all VVC 
intra modes, an average of 1.59% bitrate saving can be reached.","DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2023.3286256

underwater images usually suffer from some degradation problems, such as low 
contrast, color distortion, and blurring details, which aggravate the difficulty 
of downstream underwater understanding tasks. Therefore, how to obtain clear and 
visually pleasant images has become a common concern of people, and the task of 
underwater image enhancement (UIE) has also emerged as the times require. Among 
existing UIE methods, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based methods 
perform well in visual aesthetics, while the physical model-based methods have 
better scene adaptability. Inheriting the advantages of the above two types of

in reality. Existing augmentation-based methods separate action recognition and 
dark enhancement in a two-stage pipeline, which leads to inconsistently learning 
of temporal representation for action recognition. To address this issue, we 
propose a novel end-to-end framework termed Dark Temporal Consistency Model 
(DTCM), which is able to jointly optimize dark enhancement and action 
recognition, and force the temporal consistency to guide downstream dark feature 
learning. Specifically, DTCM cascades the action classification head with the 
dark augmentation network to perform dark video action recognition in a 
one-stage pipeline. Our explored spatio-temporal consistency loss, which 
utilizes the RGB-Difference of dark video frames to encourage temporal coherence 
of the enhanced video frames, is effective for boosting spatio-temporal 
representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our DTCM has 
remarkable performance: 1) Competitive accuracy, which outperforms the 
state-of-the-arts on the ARID dataset by 2.32% and the UAVHuman-Fisheye dataset

State Patients Induced by General Anesthesia.","Jin X, Liang Z, Wen X, Wang Y, Bai Y, Xia X, He J, Sleigh J, Li X.","OBJECTIVE: General anesthesia (GA) is necessary for surgery, even for patients 
in a minimally conscious state (MCS). The characteristics of the 
electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures of the MCS patients under GA are still 
unclear.
METHODS: The EEG during GA were recorded from 10 MCS patients undergoing spinal 
cord stimulation surgery. The power spectrum, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), 
the diversity of connectivity, and the functional network were investigated. 
Long term recovery was assessed by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised at one year 
after the surgery, and the characteristics of the patients with good or bad 
prognosis status were compared.
RESULTS: For the four MCS patients with good prognostic recovery, slow 
oscillation (0.1-1 Hz) and the alpha band (8-12 Hz) in the frontal areas 
increased during the maintenance of a surgical state of anesthesia (MOSSA), and 
""peak-max"" and ""trough-max"" patterns emerged in frontal and parietal areas. 
During MOSSA, the six MCS patients with bad prognosis demonstrated: increased 
modulation index, reduced diversity of connectivity (from mean±SD of 0.877±0.003 
to 0.776±0.003, p<0.001), reduced function connectivity significantly in theta 
band (from mean±SD of 1.032±0.043 to 0.589±0.036, p<0.001, in 
prefrontal-frontal; and from mean±SD of 0.989±0.043 to 0.684±0.036, p<0.001, in 
frontal-parietal) and reduced local and global efficiency of the network in 
delta band.
CONCLUSIONS: A bad prognosis in MCS patients is associated with signs of 
impaired thalamocortical and cortico-cortical connectivity - as indicated by 
inability to produce inter-frequency coupling and phase synchronization. These 
indices may have a role in predicting the long-term recovery of MCS patients.","DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2023.3287203

Multi-modal Whole Slide Image Analysis.","Wang Z, Yu L, Ding X, Liao X, Wang L.","The fusion of multi-modal medical data is essential to assist medical experts to 
make treatment decisions for precision medicine. For example, combining the 
whole slide histopathological images (WSIs) and tabular clinical data can more 
accurately predict the lymph node metastasis (LNM) of papillary thyroid 
carcinoma before surgery to avoid unnecessary lymph node resection. However, the 
huge-sized WSI provides much more high-dimensional information than 
low-dimensional tabular clinical data, making the information alignment 
challenging in the multi-modal WSI analysis tasks. This paper presents a novel 
transformer-guided multi-modal multi-instance learning framework to predict 
lymph node metastasis from both WSIs and tabular clinical data. We first propose 
an effective multi-instance grouping scheme, named siamese attention-based 
feature grouping (SAG), to group high-dimensional WSIs into representative 
low-dimensional feature embeddings for fusion. We then design a novel bottleneck 
shared-specific feature transfer module (BSFT) to explore the shared and 
specific features between different modalities, where a few learnable bottleneck 
tokens are utilized for knowledge transfer between modalities. Moreover, a modal 
adaptation and orthogonal projection scheme were incorporated to further 
encourage BSFT to learn shared and specific features from multi-modal data. 
Finally, the shared and specific features are dynamically aggregated via an 
attention mechanism for slide-level prediction. Experimental results on our 
collected lymph node metastasis dataset demonstrate the efficiency of our 
proposed components and our framework achieves the best performance with AUC 
(area under the curve) of 97.34%, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 
over 1.27%.","DOI: 10.1109/TMI.2023.3287256

Transformer-based network.","Marcus A, Bentley P, Rueckert D.","The cornerstone of stroke care is expedient management that varies depending on 
the time since stroke onset. Consequently, clinical decision making is centered 
on accurate knowledge of timing and often requires a radiologist to interpret 
Computed Tomography (CT) of the brain to confirm the occurrence and age of an 
event. These tasks are particularly challenging due to the subtle expression of 
acute ischemic lesions and the dynamic nature of their appearance. Automation 
efforts have not yet applied deep learning to estimate lesion age and treated 
these two tasks independently, so, have overlooked their inherent complementary 
relationship. To leverage this, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task 
transformer-based network optimized for concurrent segmentation and age 
estimation of cerebral ischemic lesions. By utilizing gated positional 
self-attention and CT-specific data augmentation, the proposed method can 
capture long-range spatial dependencies while maintaining its ability to be 
trained from scratch under low-data regimes commonly found in medical imaging. 
Furthermore, to better combine multiple predictions, we incorporate uncertainty 
by utilizing quantile loss to facilitate estimating a probability density 
function of lesion age. The effectiveness of our model is then extensively 
evaluated on a clinical dataset consisting of 776 CT images from two medical 
centers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains promising 
performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.933 for classifying lesion 
ages ≤4.5 hours compared to 0.858 using a conventional approach, and outperforms

generalizability and transparency of the learned model are highly required. To 
rectify the harmful shortcuts in medical imaging applications, in this paper, we

the visual attention from radiologists to proactively guide the vision 
transformer (ViT) model to focus on regions with potential pathology rather than 
spurious correlations. To do so, the EG-ViT model takes the masked image patches 
that are within the radiologists' interest as input while has an additional 
residual connection to the last encoder layer to maintain the interactions of 
all patches. The experiments on two medical imaging datasets demonstrate that 
the proposed EG-ViT model can effectively rectify the harmful shortcut learning

Isotropic Force Exertion.","Yoon J, Lee D, Bang J, Shin HG, Chung WK, Choi S, Kim K.","Haptic interactions play an essential role in education to enhance learning 
efficiency; however, haptic information for virtual educational content remains 
lacking. This paper proposes a planar cable-driven haptic interface with movable 
bases that can display isotropic force feedback with maximum workspace extension 
on a commercial screen display. A generalized kinematic and static analysis of 
the cable-driven mechanism is derived by considering movable pulleys. Based on 
the analyses, a system including movable bases is designed and controlled to 
maximize the workspace subject to isotropic force exertion for the target screen 
area. The proposed system is evaluated experimentally as a haptic interface 
represented by the workspace, isotropic force-feedback range, bandwidth, 
Z-width, and user experiment. The results indicate that the proposed system can 
maximize workspace to the target rectangular area and exert isotropic force up 
to 94.0% of the theoretical computed one within the workspace.","DOI: 10.1109/TOH.2023.3286353

singularities with low distortion constraints for conformal parameterizations. 
Our solution for this combinatorial problem is a two-stage procedure that first 
enhances sparsity for generating an initialization and then optimizes to reduce 
the number of cones and the parameterization distortion. Central to the first 
stage is a progressive process to determine the combinatorial variables, i.e., 
numbers, locations, and angles of cones. The second stage iteratively conducts 
adaptive cone relocations and merges close cones for optimization. We 
extensively test our method on a data set containing 3885 models, demonstrating 
practical robustness and performance. Our method achieves fewer cone

Leveraging Knowledge Repositories.","Eirich J, Jackle D, Sedlmair M, Wehner C, Schmid U, Bernard J, Schreck T.","We present ManuKnowVis, the result of a design study, in which we contextualize 
data from multiple knowledge repositories of a manufacturing process for battery 
modules used in electric vehicles. In data-driven analyses of manufacturing 
data, we observed a discrepancy between two stakeholder groups involved in 
serial manufacturing processes: Knowledge providers (e.g., engineers) have 
domain knowledge about the manufacturing process but have difficulties in 
implementing data-driven analyses. Knowledge consumers (e.g., data scientists) 
have no first-hand domain knowledge but are highly skilled in performing 
data-driven analyses. ManuKnowVis bridges the gap between providers and 
consumers and enables the creation and completion of manufacturing knowledge. We 
contribute a multi-stakeholder design study, where we developed ManuKnowVis in 
three main iterations with consumers and providers from an automotive company. 
The iterative development led us to a multiple linked view tool, in which, on 
the one hand, providers can describe and connect individual entities (e.g., 
stations or produced parts) of the manufacturing process based on their domain 
knowledge. On the other hand, consumers can leverage this enhanced data to 
better understand complex domain problems, thus, performing data analyses more 
efficiently. As such, our approach directly impacts the success of data-driven 
analyses from manufacturing data. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, 
we carried out a case study with seven domain experts, which demonstrates how 
providers can externalize their knowledge and consumers can implement 
data-driven analyses more efficiently.","DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2023.3279857

Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization.","Chen Q, Sun J, Palade V.","The goal of textual adversarial attack methods is to replace some words in an 
input text in order to make the victim model misbehave. This article proposes an 
effective word-level adversarial attack method based on sememes and an improved 
quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. The sememe-based 
substitute method, which uses the words sharing the same sememes as the 
substitutes of the original words, is first employed to form the reduced search 
space. Then, an improved QPSO algorithm, called historical information-guided 
QPSO with random drift local attractor (HIQPSO-RD), is proposed to search the 
reduced search space for adversarial examples. The HIQPSO-RD introduces 
historical information into the current mean best position of the QPSO, for the 
purpose of improving the convergence speed of the algorithm, by enhancing its 
exploration ability and preventing the premature convergence of the swarm. The 
proposed algorithm uses the random drift local attractor technique to make a 
good balance between its exploration and exploitation, so that the algorithm can 
find a better adversarial attack example with low grammaticality and perplexity 
(PPL). In addition, it employs a two-stage diversity control strategy to enhance 
the search performance of the algorithm. Experiments on three natural language 
processing (NLP) datasets, with three commonly used nature language processing 
models as victim models, show that our method achieves higher attack success 
rates but lower modification rates than the state-of-the-art adversarial attack 
methods. Moreover, the results of human evaluations show that adversarial 
examples generated by our method can better maintain the semantic similarity and 
grammatical correctness of the original input.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3283308

emerge in many important applications. These applications can often be cast into 
standard graph learning tasks, in which a crucial step is to learn 
low-dimensional graph representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are 
currently the most popular model in graph embedding approaches. However, 
standard GNNs in the neighborhood aggregation paradigm suffer from limited 
discriminative power in distinguishing high-order graph structures as opposed to 
low-order structures. To capture high-order structures, researchers have 
resorted to motifs and developed motif-based GNNs. However, the existing 
motif-based GNNs still often suffer from less discriminative power on high-order 
structures. To overcome the above limitations, we propose motif GNN (MGNN), a 
novel framework to better capture high-order structures, hinging on our proposed 
motif redundancy minimization operator and injective motif combination. First, 
MGNN produces a set of node representations with respect to each motif. The next 
phase is our proposed redundancy minimization among motifs which compares the 
motifs with each other and distills the features unique to each motif. Finally, 
MGNN performs the updating of node representations by combining multiple 
representations from different motifs. In particular, to enhance the 
discriminative power, MGNN uses an injective function to combine the 
representations with respect to different motifs. We further show that our 
proposed architecture increases the expressive power of GNNs with a theoretical 
analysis. We demonstrate that MGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seven 
public benchmarks on both the node classification and graph classification 
tasks.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3281716

a relation using only a few reference triples of the relation, has attracted 
much attention in recent years. Most existing FKGC methods learn a transferable 
embedding space, where entity pairs belonging to the same relations are close to 
each other. In real-world knowledge graphs (KGs), however, some relations may 
involve multiple semantics, and their entity pairs are not always close due to 
having different meanings. Hence, the existing FKGC methods may yield suboptimal 
performance when handling multiple semantic relations in the few-shot scenario. 
To solve this problem, we propose a new method named adaptive prototype 
interaction network (APINet) for FKGC. Our model consists of two major 
components: 1) an interaction attention encoder (InterAE) to capture the 
underlying relational semantics of entity pairs by modeling the interactive 
information between head and tail entities and 2) an adaptive prototype net 
(APNet) to generate relation prototypes adaptive to different query triples by 
extracting query-relevant reference pairs and reducing the data inconsistency 
between support and query sets. Experimental results on two public datasets 
demonstrate that APINet outperforms several state-of-the-art FKGC methods. The 
ablation study demonstrates the rationality and effectiveness of each component 
of APINet.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3283545

Function for Autonomous Driving.","Huang Z, Liu H, Wu J, Lv C.","Predicting the future states of surrounding traffic participants and planning a 
safe, smooth, and socially compliant trajectory accordingly are crucial for 
autonomous vehicles (AVs). There are two major issues with the current 
autonomous driving system: the prediction module is often separated from the 
planning module, and the cost function for planning is hard to specify and tune. 
To tackle these issues, we propose a differentiable integrated prediction and 
planning (DIPP) framework that can also learn the cost function from data. 
Specifically, our framework uses a differentiable nonlinear optimizer as the 
motion planner, which takes as input the predicted trajectories of surrounding 
agents given by the neural network and optimizes the trajectory for the AV, 
enabling all operations to be differentiable, including the cost function 
weights. The proposed framework is trained on a large-scale real-world driving 
dataset to imitate human driving trajectories in the entire driving scene and 
validated in both open-loop and closed-loop manners. The open-loop testing 
results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods across 
a variety of metrics and delivers planning-centric prediction results, allowing 
the planning module to output trajectories close to those of human drivers. In 
closed-loop testing, the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods, 
showing the ability to handle complex urban driving scenarios and robustness 
against the distributional shift. Importantly, we find that joint training of 
planning and prediction modules achieves better performance than planning with a 
separate trained prediction module in both open-loop and closed-loop tests. 
Moreover, the ablation study indicates that the learnable components in the 
framework are essential to ensure planning stability and performance. Code and

Alignment.","Piao Z, Tang L, Zhao B.","Unsupervised domain-adaptive object detection uses labeled source domain data 
and unlabeled target domain data to alleviate the domain shift and reduce the 
dependence on the target domain data labels. For object detection, the features 
responsible for classification and localization are different. However, the 
existing methods basically only consider classification alignment, which is not 
conducive to cross-domain localization. To address this issue, in this article, 
we focus on the alignment of localization regression in domain-adaptive object 
detection and propose a novel localization regression alignment (LRA) method. 
The idea is that the domain-adaptive localization regression problem can be 
transformed into a general domain-adaptive classification problem first, and 
then adversarial learning is applied to the converted classification problem. 
Specifically, LRA first discretizes the continuous regression space, and the 
discrete regression intervals are treated as bins. Then, a novel binwise 
alignment (BA) strategy is proposed through adversarial learning. BA can further 
contribute to the overall cross-domain feature alignment for object detection. 
Extensive experiments are conducted on different detectors in various scenarios, 
and the state-of-the-art performance is achieved; these results demonstrate the 
effectiveness of our method. The code will be available at:

artery after flow diverter deployment for an infectious cavernous carotid 
aneurysm: illustrative case.","Osuki T, Ikeda H, Uezato M, Kinosada M, Kurosaki Y, Chin M.","BACKGROUND: Infectious aneurysms very rarely occur in the cavernous carotid 
artery. Recently, treatment by flow diverter implantation with preservation of 
the parent artery has been the treatment of choice.
OBSERVATIONS: A 64-year-old woman presented with stenosis at the C5 segment of 
the left internal carotid artery (ICA), followed by ocular symptoms within 2 
weeks, with a de novo aneurysm in the left cavernous carotid artery and wall 
irregularity with stenosis from the C2 to C5 segments of the left ICA. 
Antimicrobial therapy was given for 6 weeks, and a Pipeline Flex Shield was 
implanted. Angiography 6 months after treatment showed complete obliteration of 
the infectious aneurysm and improvement of the stenosis. However, de novo 
expansions were formed in the outer curvature of C3 and C4 segments of the ICA 
where the Pipeline device had been deployed.
LESSONS: Aneurysms that develop rapidly and show shape changes over time, 
accompanied by fever and inflammation, may be associated with an infection. 
Because of the fragility in the irregular wall of the parent vessel associated 
with infectious aneurysms, de novo expansion may form in the outer curvature of 
the parent vessel after flow diverter placement; thus, careful follow-up is 
necessary.","DOI: 10.3171/CASE23124

completed after one week: a split-mouth randomized clinical trial.","Sahni A, Sharma RK, Tewari S, Gill PS, Arora R.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of supragingival scaling on the clinical 
outcomes of subgingival instrumentation completed after one week.
METHODS: In 27 patients with Stage II and Stage III periodontitis, pairs of 
contra-lateral quadrants were randomly assigned into test group 1- single 
sitting scaling and root planing (SRP) and test group 2- supragingival scaling 
followed by subgingival instrumentation after a week. Periodontal parameters 
were recorded at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months; GCF VEGF estimation was done at 
baseline in both groups and 7 days after supragingival scaling in test group 2.
RESULTS: At 6 months, significantly better improvement in test group 1 at sites 
with PPD>5mm; (ΔPPD=2.32 vs. 1.41mm; p=0.001, ΔCAL=2.34 vs. 1.39mm; p=0.001) was 
observed. Supragingival scaling resulted in significant reduction in GCF VEGF 
(42.46 to 27.88pg/site) after one week. Regression analysis explained 
14%variance in VEGF to baseline PPD at sites with PPD>4mm; 21% variance in CAL 
improvement to VEGF at sites with PPD>5mm. Percentage of sites with PPD=5-8mm 
reaching clinical end-point was 52% and 40% for test group 1 and test group 2 
respectively. Better results were noticed in BOPP positive sites in both groups.
CONCLUSION: The sites with PPD>5mm where supragingival scaling was followed by 
subgingival instrumentation after one week resulted in less favourable treatment 
outcomes. (NCT05449964).","DOI: 10.3290/j.qi.b4168461

Preprint.","Combined GWAS and single cell transcriptomics uncover the underlying genes and 
cell types in disorders of gut-brain interaction.","Majd A, Richter MN, Samuel RM, Cesiulis A, Ghazizadeh Z, Wang J, Fattahi F.","Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), formerly known as functional 
gastrointestinal disorders, are extremely common and historically difficult to 
manage. This is largely because their cellular and molecular mechanisms have 
remained poorly understood and understudied. One approach to unravel the 
molecular underpinnings of complex disorders such as DGBIs is performing genome 
wide association studies (GWASs). However, due to the heterogenous and 
non-specific nature of GI symptoms, it has been difficult to accurately classify 
cases and controls. Thus, to perform reliable studies, we need to access large 
patient populations which has been difficult to date. Here, we leveraged the UK 
Biobank (UKBB) database, containing genetic and medical record data of over half 
a million individuals, to perform GWAS for five DGBI categories: functional 
chest pain, functional diarrhea, functional dyspepsia, functional dysphagia, and 
functional fecal incontinence. By applying strict inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, we resolved patient populations and identified genes significantly 
associated with each condition. Leveraging multiple human single-cell 
RNA-sequencing datasets, we found that the disease associated genes were highly 
expressed in enteric neurons, which innervate and control GI functions. Further 
expression and association testing-based analyses revealed specific enteric 
neuron subtypes consistently linked with each DGBI. Furthermore, protein-protein 
interaction analysis of each of the disease associated genes revealed protein 
networks specific to each DGBI, including hedgehog signaling for functional 
chest pain and neuronal function and neurotransmission for functional diarrhea 
and functional dyspepsia. Finally, through retrospective medical record analysis 
we found that drugs that inhibit these networks are associated with an increased 
disease risk, including serine/threonine kinase 32B drugs for functional chest 
pain, solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4C1, 
mitogen-activated protein kinase 6, and dual serine/threonine and tyrosine 
protein kinase drugs for functional dyspepsia, and serotonin transporter drugs 
for functional diarrhea. This study presents a robust strategy for uncovering 
the tissues, cell types, and genes involved in DGBIs, presenting novel 
predictions of the mechanisms underlying these historically intractable and 
poorly understood diseases.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.23290906

Preprint.","Aberrant landscapes of maternal meiotic crossovers contribute to aneuploidies in 
human embryos.","Ariad D, Madjunkova S, Madjunkov M, Chen S, Abramov R, Librach C, McCoy RC.","Meiotic recombination is a fundamental source of human genetic diversity and is 
also critical for ensuring the accuracy of chromosome segregation. Understanding 
the landscape of meiotic recombination, its variation across individuals, and 
the processes by which it goes awry are long-standing goals in human genetics. 
Current approaches for inferring the landscape of recombination either rely on 
population genetic patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD)-capturing a 
time-averaged view-or direct detection of crossovers in gametes or 
multi-generation pedigrees, limiting the scale and availability of relevant 
datasets. Here, we introduce an approach for inferring sex-specific landscapes 
of recombination from retrospective analysis of data from preimplantation 
genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) based on low-coverage (<0.05×) 
whole-genome sequencing of biopsies from in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos. To 
overcome the sparsity of these data, our method exploits its inherent 
relatedness structure, knowledge of haplotypes from external population 
reference panels, as well as the frequent occurrence of chromosome loss in 
embryos, whereby the remaining chromosome is phased by default. Based on 
extensive simulation, we show that our method retains high accuracy down to 
coverages as low as 0.02×. Applying this method to low-coverage PGT-A data from 
18,967 embryos, we mapped 70,660 recombination events at an average resolution 
of ∼150 kbp, replicating key features of sex-specific recombination maps from 
the literature. We observed that the total length of the female genetic map is 
reduced for trisomies compared to disomies, while the genomic distribution of 
crossovers is also altered in a chromosome-specific manner. Based on haplotype 
configurations detected in regions surrounding the centromeres, our data 
additionally indicate that individual chromosomes possess unique propensities 
for different mechanisms of meiotic error. Together, our results provide a 
detailed view of the role of aberrant meiotic recombination in the origins of 
human aneuploidies, as well as a flexible tool for mapping crossovers in 
low-coverage sequencing data from multiple siblings.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.543910

Preprint.","Interdependence of a microtubule polymerase and a motor protein in establishment 
of kinetochore end-on attachments.","Torvi JR, Wong J, Drubin DG, Barnes G.","Faithful segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells during mitosis requires 
formation of attachments between kinetochores and mitotic spindle microtubules. 
Chromosome alignment on the mitotic spindle, also referred to as congression, is 
facilitated by translocation of side-bound chromosomes along the microtubule 
surface, which allows the establishment of end-on attachment of kinetochores to 
microtubule plus ends. Spatial and temporal constraints hinder observation of 
these events in live cells. Therefore, we used our previously developed 
reconstitution assay to observe dynamics of kinetochores, the yeast kinesin-8, 
Kip3, and the microtubule polymerase, Stu2, in lysates prepared from 
metaphase-arrested budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Using total 
internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to observe kinetochore 
translocation on the lateral microtubule surface toward the microtubule plus 
end, motility was shown to be dependent on both Kip3, as we reported previously, 
and Stu2. These proteins were shown to have distinct dynamics on the 
microtubule. Kip3 is highly processive and moves faster than the kinetochore. 
Stu2 tracks both growing and shrinking microtubule ends but also colocalizes 
with moving lattice-bound kinetochores. In cells, we observed that both Kip3 and 
Stu2 are important for establishing chromosome biorientation, Moreover, when 
both proteins are absent, biorientation is completely defective. All cells 
lacking both Kip3 and Stu2 had declustered kinetochores and about half also had 
at least one unattached kinetochore. Our evidence argues that despite 
differences in their dynamics, Kip3 and Stu2 share roles in chromosome 
congression to facilitate proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544255

Preprint.","Mechanisms of dual modulatory effects of spermine on the mitochondrial calcium 
uniporter complex.","Tu YC, Chao FY, Tsai MF.","The mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter mediates the crucial cellular process of 
mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake, which regulates cell bioenergetics, intracellular Ca 
2+ signaling, and cell death initiation. The uniporter contains the pore-forming 
MCU subunit, an EMRE protein that binds to MCU, and the regulatory MICU1 
subunit, which can dimerize with MICU1 or MICU2 and under resting cellular [Ca 
2+ ] occludes the MCU pore. It has been known for decades that spermine, which 
is ubiquitously present in animal cells, can enhance mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake, 
but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that spermine exerts 
dual modulatory effects on the uniporter. In physiological concentrations of 
spermine, it enhances uniporter activity by breaking the physical interactions 
between MCU and the MICU1-containing dimers to allow the uniporter to 
constitutively take up Ca 2+ even in low [Ca 2+ ] conditions. This potentiation 
effect does not require MICU2 or the EF-hand motifs in MICU1. When [spermine] 
rises to millimolar levels, it inhibits the uniporter by targeting the pore 
region in a MICU-independent manner. The MICU1-dependent spermine potentiation 
mechanism proposed here, along with our previous finding that cardiac 
mitochondria have very low MICU1, can explain the puzzling observation in the 
literature that mitochondria in the heart show no response to spermine.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543936

Osbun JW, Genin GM.","Endovascular procedures provide surgeons and other interventionalists with 
minimally invasive methods to treat vascular diseases by passing guidewires, 
catheters, sheaths and treatment devices into the vasculature to and navigate 
toward a treatment site. The efficiency of this navigation affects patient 
outcomes, but is frequently compromised by catheter ""herniation"", in which the 
catheter-guidewire system bulges out from the intended endovascular pathway so 
that the interventionalist can no longer advance it. Here, we showed herniation 
to be a bifurcation phenomenon that can be predicted and controlled using 
mechanical characterizations of catheter-guidewire systems and patientspecific 
clinical imaging. We demonstrated our approach in laboratory models and, 
retrospectively, in patients who underwent procedures involving transradial 
neurovascular procedures with an endovascular pathway from the wrist, up in the 
arm, around the aortic arch, and into the neurovasculature. Our analyses 
identified a mathematical navigation stability criterion that predicted 
herniation in all of these settings. Results show that herniation can be 
predicted through bifurcation analysis, and provide a framework for selecting 
catheter-guidewire systems to avoid herniation in specific patient anatomy.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543219

G, Conley P, Rothfels K, Hermjakob H, Stein L, D'Eustachio P, Wu G.","Limited knowledge about a substantial portion of protein coding genes, known as

therapeutic applications. To address this, we leveraged Reactome, the most 
comprehensive, open source, open-access pathway knowledgebase, to contextualize 
dark proteins within biological pathways. By integrating multiple resources and 
employing a random forest classifier trained on 106 protein/gene pairwise 
features, we predicted functional interactions between dark proteins and 
Reactome-annotated proteins. We then developed three scores to measure the 
interactions between dark proteins and Reactome pathways, utilizing enrichment 
analysis and fuzzy logic simulations. Correlation analysis of these scores with 
an independent single-cell RNA sequencing dataset provided supporting evidence 
for this approach. Furthermore, systematic natural language processing (NLP) 
analysis of over 22 million PubMed abstracts and manual checking of the 
literature associated with 20 randomly selected dark proteins reinforced the 
predicted interactions between proteins and pathways. To enhance the 
visualization and exploration of dark proteins within Reactome pathways, we 
developed the Reactome IDG portal, deployed at https://idg.reactome.org , a web

Preprint.","Autism- and epilepsy-associated EEF1A2 mutations lead to translational 
dysfunction and altered actin bundling.","Mohamed MS, Klann E.","Protein synthesis is a fundamental cellular process in neurons that is essential 
for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Here, we describe our 
investigations of a neuron- and muscle-specific translation factor, e ukaryotic 
E longation F actor 1a2 (eEF1A2), which when mutated in patients results in 
autism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. We characterize three most common 
EEF1A2 patient mutations, G70S, E122K, and D252H, and demonstrate that all three 
mutations decrease de novo protein synthesis and elongation rates in HEK293 
cells. In mouse cortical neurons, the EEF1A2 mutations not only decrease de novo 
protein synthesis, but also alter neuronal morphology, regardless of endogenous 
levels of eEF1A2, indicating that the mutations act via a toxic gain of 
function. We also show that eEF1A2 mutant proteins display increased tRNA 
binding and decreased actin bundling activity, suggesting that these mutations 
disrupt neuronal function by decreasing tRNA availability and altering the actin 
cytoskeleton. More broadly, our findings are consistent with the idea that 
eEF1A2 acts as a bridge between translation and the actin skeleton, which is 
essential for proper neuron development and function.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: E ukaryotic E longation F actor 1A2 (eEF1A2) is a 
muscle- and neuron-specific translation factor responsible for bringing charge 
tRNAs to the elongating ribosome. Why neurons express this unique translation 
factor is unclear; however, it is known that mutations in EEF1A2 cause severe 
drug-resistant epilepsy, autism and neurodevelopmental delay. Here, we 
characterize the impact of three common disease-causing mutations in EEF1A2 and 
demonstrate that they cause decreased protein synthesis via reduced translation 
elongation, increased tRNA binding, decreased actin bundling activity, as well 
as altered neuronal morphology. We posit that eEF1A2 serves as a bridge between 
translation and the actin cytoskeleton, linking these two processes that are 
essential for neuronal function and plasticity.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543912

a role in Huntington's disease (HD), as previous studies demonstrated either no 
alterations or increases in phosphorylated tau (pTau) in HD post-mortem brain 
and mouse models.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine whether total tau and pTau 
levels are altered in HD.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, cellular fractionations, and western blots were 
used to measure tau and pTau levels in a large cohort of HD and control 
post-mortem prefrontal cortex (PFC). Furthermore, western blots were performed 
to assess tau, and pTau levels in HD and control isogenic embryonic stem cell 
(ESC)-derived cortical neurons and neuronal stem cells (NSCs). Similarly, 
western blots were used to assess tau and pTau in Htt Q111 and transgenic R6/2 
mice. Lastly, total tau levels were assessed in HD and healthy control plasma 
using Quanterix Simoa assay.
RESULTS: Our results revealed that, while there was no difference in tau or pTau 
levels in HD PFC compared to controls, tau phosphorylated at S396 levels were 
increased in PFC samples from HD patients 60 years or older at time of death. 
Additionally, tau and pTau levels were not changed in HD ESC-derived cortical 
neurons and NSCs. Similarly, tau or pTau levels were not altered in Htt Q111 and 
transgenic R6/2 mice compared to wild-type littermates. Lastly, tau levels were 
not changed in plasma from a small cohort of HD patients compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: Together these findings demonstrate that pTau-S396 levels increase 
significantly with age in HD PFC.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.03.23290851

(FALD) remain largely unknown. We aimed to assess intrahepatic transcriptomic 
differences among patients with FALD according to the degree of liver fibrosis 
and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults with the Fontan 
circulation at the Ahmanson/UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease Center. 
Clinical, laboratory, imaging and hemodynamic data prior to the liver biopsy 
were extracted from medical records. Patients were classified into early (F1-F2) 
or advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin 
embedded liver biopsy samples; RNA libraries were constructed using rRNA 
depletion method and sequencing was performed on Illumina Novaseq 6000. 
Differential gene expression and gene ontology analyses were carried out using 
DESeq2 and Metascape. Medical records were comprehensively reviewed for a 
composite clinical outcome which included decompensated cirrhosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, protein-losing enteropathy, 
chronic kidney disease stage 4 or higher, or death.
RESULTS: Patients with advanced fibrosis had higher serum BNP levels and Fontan, 
mean pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures. The composite clinical 
outcome was present in 23 patients (22%) and was predicted by age at Fontan, 
right ventricular morphology and presence of aortopulmonary collaterals on 
multivariable analysis. Samples with advanced fibrosis had 228 up-regulated 
genes compared to early fibrosis. Samples with the composite clinical outcome 
had 894 up-regulated genes compared to those without it. A total of 136 
up-regulated genes were identified in both comparisons and these genes were 
enriched in cellular response to cytokine stimulus, response to oxidative 
stress, VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and 
vasculature development.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FALD and advanced liver fibrosis or the composite 
clinical outcome exhibit up-regulated genes including pathways related to 
inflammation, congestion, and angiogenesis. This adds further insight into FALD 
pathophysiology.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290997

Preprint.","Tau accumulation and its spatial progression across the Alzheimer's disease 
spectrum.","St-Onge F, Chapleau M, Breitner JC, Villeneuve S, Binette AP; Alzheimer’s 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.","The spread of tau abnormality in sporadic Alzheimer's disease is believed 
typically to follow neuropathologically defined Braak staging. Recent in-vivo 
positron emission tomography (PET) evidence challenges this belief, however, as 
spreading patterns for tau appear heterogenous among individuals with varying 
clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease. We therefore sought better 
understanding of the spatial distribution of tau in the preclinical and clinical 
phases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and its association with cognitive 
decline. Longitudinal tau-PET data (1,370 scans) from 832 participants (463 
cognitively unimpaired, 277 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 92 with 
Alzheimer's disease dementia) were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative. Among these, we defined thresholds of abnormal tau 
deposition in 70 brain regions from the Desikan atlas, and for each group of 
regions characteristic of Braak staging. We summed each scan's number of regions 
with abnormal tau deposition to form a spatial extent index. We then examined 
patterns of tau pathology cross-sectionally and longitudinally and assessed 
their heterogeneity. Finally, we compared our spatial extent index of tau uptake 
with a temporal meta region of interest-a commonly used proxy of tau 
burden-assessing their association with cognitive scores and clinical 
progression. More than 80% of amyloid-beta positive participants across 
diagnostic groups followed typical Braak staging, both cross-sectionally and 
longitudinally. Within each Braak stage, however, the pattern of abnormality 
demonstrated significant heterogeneity such that overlap of abnormal regions 
across participants averaged less than 50%. The annual rate of change in number 
of abnormal tau-PET regions was similar among individuals without cognitive 
impairment and those with Alzheimer's disease dementia. Spread of disease 
progressed more rapidly, however, among participants with MCI. The latter's 
change on our spatial extent measure amounted to 2.5 newly abnormal regions per 
year, as contrasted with 1 region/year among the other groups. Comparing the 
association of tau pathology and cognitive performance in MCI and Alzheimer's

Preprint.",A Boltzmann model predicts glycan structures from lectin binding.,"Yom AJ, Chiang AWT, Lewis NE.","Glycans are complex polysaccharides involved in many diseases and biological 
processes. Unfortunately, current methods for determining glycan composition and 
structure (glycan sequencing) are laborious and require a high level of 
expertise. Here, we assess the feasibility of sequencing glycans based on their 
lectin binding fingerprints. By training a Boltzmann model on lectin binding 
data, we are able to predict the approximate structures of 90 ± 5% of N-glycans 
in our test set. We further show that our model generalizes well to the 
pharmaceutically relevant case of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell glycans. We 
also analyze the motif specificity of a wide array of lectins and identify the 
most and least predictive lectins and glycan features. These results could help

Preprint.","Vinorelbine causes a neuropathic pain-like state in mice via STING and MNK1 
signaling associated with type I interferon induction.","Franco-Enzástiga Ú, Natarajan K, David ET, Patel KJ, Ravirala A, Price TJ.","Type I interferons (IFNs) increase the excitability of dorsal root ganglion 
(DRG) neurons via activation of MNK-eIF4E translation signaling to promote pain 
sensitization in mice. Activation of STING signaling is a key component of type 
I IFN induction. Manipulation of STING signaling is an active area of 
investigation in cancer and other therapeutic areas. Vinorelbine is a 
chemotherapeutic that activates STING and has been shown to cause pain and 
neuropathy in oncology clinical trials in patients. There are conflicting 
reports on whether STING signaling promotes or inhibits pain in mice. We 
hypothesized that vinorelbine would cause a neuropathic pain-like state in mice 
via STING and signaling pathways in DRG neurons associated with type I IFN 
induction. Vinorelbine (10 mg/kg, i.v.) induced tactile allodynia and grimacing 
in WT male and female mice and increased p-IRF3 and type I IFN protein in 
peripheral nerves. In support of our hypothesis, vinorelbine-mediated pain was 
absent in male and female Sting Gt/Gt mice. Vinorelbine also failed to induce 
IRF3 and type I IFN signaling in these mice. Since type I IFNs engage 
translational control via MNK1-eIF4E in DRG nociceptors, we assessed 
vinorelbine-mediated p-eIF4E changes. Vinorelbine increased p-eIF4E in DRG in WT 
animals but not in Sting Gt/Gt or Mknk1 -/- (MNK1 KO) mice. Consistent with 
these biochemical findings, vinorelbine had an attenuated pro-nociceptive effect 
in male and female MNK1 KO mice. Our findings support the conclusion that 
activation of STING signaling in the peripheral nervous system causes a 
neuropathic pain-like state that is mediated by type I IFN signaling to DRG

preclinical models, characterized by neural infiltrations of neutrophils and 
monocytes, as well as altered neurovascular endothelial phenotypes. To address 
the longevity of such outcomes, the present study examined the neuroinflammatory 
and metabolomic temporal dynamics after inhalation exposures from 
biomass-derived smoke. 2-month-old female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to wood 
smoke every other day for two weeks at an average exposure concentration of 
0.5mg/m 3 . Subsequent serial euthanasia occurred at 1-, 3-, 7-, 14-, and 
28-days post-exposure. Flow cytometry of right hemispheres revealed two 
endothelial populations of PECAM (CD31), high and medium expressors, with wood 
smoke inhalation causing an increased proportion of PECAM Hi . These populations 
of PECAM Hi and PECAM Med were associated with an anti-inflammatory and 
pro-inflammatory response, respectively, and their inflammatory profiles were 
largely resolved by the 28-day mark. However, activated microglial populations 
(CD11b + /CD45 low ) remained higher in wood smoke-exposed mice than controls at 
day 28. Infiltrating neutrophil populations decreased to levels below controls 
by day 28. However, the MHC-II expression of the peripheral immune infiltrate 
remained high, and the population of neutrophils retained an increased 
expression of CD45, Ly6C, and MHC-II. Utilizing an unbiased approach examining 
the metabolomic alterations, we observed notable hippocampal perturbations in 
neurotransmitter and signaling molecules like glutamate, quinolinic acid, and 
5-α-dihydroprogesterone. Utilizing a targeted panel designed to explore the 
aging-associated NAD + metabolic pathway, wood smoke exposure drove fluctuations 
and compensations across the 28-day time course, ending with decreased 
hippocampal NAD + abundance at day 28. Summarily, these results indicate a 
highly dynamic neuroinflammatory environment, with potential resolution 
extending past 28 days, the implications of which may include long-term 
behavioral changes, systemic and neurological sequalae directly associated wtith

closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. Despite 
available therapeutic anti-HBV agents, eliminating the cccDNA remains 
challenging. The quantifying and understanding dynamics of cccDNA are essential 
for developing effective treatment strategies and new drugs. However, it 
requires a liver biopsy to measure the intrahepatic cccDNA, which is basically 
not accepted because of the ethical aspect. We here aimed to develop a 
non-invasive method for quantifying cccDNA in the liver using surrogate markers 
present in peripheral blood. We constructed a multiscale mathematical model that 
explicitly incorporates both intracellular and intercellular HBV infection 
processes. The model, based on age-structured partial differential equations

By applying this model, we successfully predicted the amount and dynamics of 
intrahepatic cccDNA using specific viral markers in serum samples, including HBV 
DNA, HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBcrAg. Our study represents a significant step towards 
advancing the understanding of chronic HBV infection. The non-invasive

Passalacqua LFM, Bredy TW, Wood MA, Lupták A.","A self-cleaving ribozyme that maps to an intron of the cytoplasmic 
polyadenylation element binding protein 3 ( CPEB3 ) gene is thought to play a 
role in human episodic memory, but the underlying mechanisms mediating this 
effect are not known. We tested the activity of the murine sequence and found 
that the ribozyme's self-scission half-life matches the time it takes an RNA 
polymerase to reach the immediate downstream exon, suggesting that the 
ribozyme-dependent intron cleavage is tuned to co-transcriptional splicing of 
the CPEB3 mRNA. Our studies also reveal that the murine ribozyme modulates 
maturation of its harboring mRNA in both cultured cortical neurons and the 
hippocampus: inhibition of the ribozyme using an antisense oligonucleotide leads 
to increased CPEB3 protein expression, which enhances polyadenylation and 
translation of localized plasticity-related target mRNAs, and subsequently 
strengthens hippocampal-dependent long-term memory. These findings reveal a 
previously unknown role for self-cleaving ribozyme activity in regulating 
experience-induced co-transcriptional and local translational processes required 
for learning and memory.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation is one 
of the key steps for regulating protein synthesis and neuroplasticity in the 
hippocampus. The CPEB3 ribozyme is a highly conserved mammalian self-cleaving 
catalytic RNA with unknown biological roles. In this study, we investigated how 
the intronic ribozyme affects the CPEB3 mRNA maturation and translation, and its 
subsequent effect on memory formation. Our findings show that the ribozyme 
activity is anti-correlated with CPEB3 mRNA splicing: inhibition of the ribozyme 
results in higher mRNA and protein levels, which contribute to long-term memory. 
Our studies offer new insights into the role of the CPEB3 ribozyme in neuronal 
translational control for the activity-dependent synaptic functions that 
underlie long-term memory and demonstrate a novel biological role for 
self-cleaving ribozymes.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.543953

Preprint.",Neighbor cells restrain furrowing during epithelial cytokinesis.,"Landino J, Misterovich E, Chumki S, Miller AL.","Cytokinesis challenges epithelial tissue homeostasis by generating forces that 
pull on neighboring cells via cell-cell junctions. Previous work has shown that 
junction reinforcement at the furrow in Xenopus laevis epithelia regulates the 
speed of furrowing 1 . This suggests the cytokinetic array that drives cell 
division is subject to resistive forces from epithelial neighbor cells. We show 
here that contractility factors accumulate in neighboring cells near the furrow 
during cytokinesis. Additionally, increasing neighbor cell stiffness, via 
ɑ-actinin overexpression, or contractility, through optogenetic Rho activation 
in one neighbor cell, slows or asymmetrically pauses furrowing, respectively. 
Notably, optogenetic stimulation of neighbor cell contractility on both sides of 
the furrow induces cytokinetic failure and binucleation. We conclude that forces 
from the cytokinetic array in the dividing cell are carefully balanced with 
restraining forces generated by neighbor cells, and neighbor cell mechanics 
regulate the speed and success of cytokinesis.

extending the base pairing alphabet beyond A-T and G-C to include the pair 
between 2-amino-8-(1'-β-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-imidazo-[1,2- a 
]-1,3,5-triazin-(8 H )-4-one and 
6-amino-3-(1'-β-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-5-nitro-(1 H )-pyridin-2-one, simply P 
and Z. To obtain the thermodynamic parameters needed to include P-Z pairs in the 
designs, we performed 47 optical melting experiments and combined the results 
with previous work to fit a new set of free energy and enthalpy nearest neighbor 
folding parameters for P-Z pairs and G-Z wobble pairs. We find that G-Z pairs 
have stability comparable to A-T pairs and therefore should be considered 
quantitatively by structure prediction and design algorithms. Additionally, we 
extrapolated the set of loop, terminal mismatch, and dangling end parameters to 
include P and Z nucleotides. These parameters were incorporated into the 
RNAstructure software package for secondary structure prediction and analysis. 
Using the RNAstructure Design program, we solved 99 of the 100 design problems 
posed by Eterna using the ACGT alphabet or supplementing with P-Z pairs. 
Extending the alphabet reduced the propensity of sequences to fold into 
off-target structures, as evaluated by the normalized ensemble defect (NED). The 
NED values were improved relative to those from the Eterna example solutions in 
91 of 99 cases where Eterna-player solutions were provided. P-Z-containing 
designs had average NED values of 0.040, significantly below the 0.074 of 
standard-DNA-only designs, and inclusion of the P-Z pairs decreased the time 
needed to converge on a design. This work provides a sample pipeline for 
inclusion of any expanded alphabet nucleotides into prediction and design

Preprint.","Natural Silencing of Quorum-Sensing Activity Protects Vibrio parahaemolyticus 
from Lysis by an Autoinducer-Detecting Phage.","Duddy OP, Silpe JE, Fei C, Bassler BL.","Quorum sensing (QS) is a chemical communication process that bacteria use to 
track population density and orchestrate collective behaviors. QS relies on the 
production, accumulation, and group-wide detection of extracellular signal 
molecules called autoinducers. Vibriophage 882 (phage VP882), a bacterial virus, 
encodes a homolog of the Vibrio QS receptor-transcription factor, called VqmA, 
that monitors the Vibrio QS autoinducer DPO. Phage VqmA binds DPO at high 
host-cell density and activates transcription of the phage gene qtip . Qtip, an 
antirepressor, launches the phage lysis program. Phage-encoded VqmA when bound 
to DPO also manipulates host QS by activating transcription of the host gene 
vqmR . VqmR is a small RNA that controls downstream QS target genes. Here, we 
sequence Vibrio parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882, the strain from which phage 
VP882 was initially isolated. The chromosomal region normally encoding vqmR and 
vqmA harbors a deletion encompassing vqmR and a portion of the vqmA promoter, 
inactivating that QS system. We discover that V. parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6

encoding the central QS transcriptional regulator LuxO. Both the vqmR-vqmA and 
luxO mutations lock V. parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882 into the low-cell 
density QS state. Reparation of the QS defects in V. parahaemolyticus strain 
O3:K6 882 promotes activation of phage VP882 lytic gene expression and LuxO is 
primarily responsible for this effect. Phage VP882-infected QS-competent V. 
parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882 cells lyse more rapidly and produce more viral 
particles than the QS-deficient parent strain. We propose that, in V. 
parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882, constitutive maintenance of the low-cell 
density QS state suppresses the launch of the phage VP882 lytic cascade, thereby 
protecting the bacterial host from phage-mediated lysis.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543668

dominance.","Coleman PT, Costanza-Chavez GW, Martin HN, Amat J, Frank MG, Sanchez RJ, Potter 
GJ, Mellert SM, Carter RK, Bonnici GN, Maier SF, Baratta MV.","Dominance status has extensive effects on physical and mental health, and an 
individual's relative position can be shaped by experiential factors. A variety 
of considerations suggest that the experience of behavioral control over 
stressors should produce winning in dominance tests and that winning should 
blunt the impact of later stressors, as does prior control. To investigate the 
interplay between competitive success and stressor control, we first examined 
the impact of stressor controllability on subsequent performance in a warm spot 
competition test modified for rats. Prior experience of controllable, but not 
physically identical uncontrollable, stress increased later effortful behavior 
and occupation of the warm spot. Controllable stress subjects consistently 
ranked higher than did uncontrollable stress subjects. Pharmacological 
inactivation of the prelimbic (PL) cortex during behavioral control prevented 
later facilitation of dominance. Next, we explored whether repeated winning 
experiences produced later resistance against the typical sequelae of 
uncontrollable stress. To establish dominance status, triads of rats were given 
five sessions of warm spot competition. Reversible inactivation of the PL or 
NMDA receptor blockade in the dorsomedial striatum led to a long-term reduction 
in social rank. Stable dominance blunted the later stress-induced increase in 
dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic activity, as well as prevented stress-induced 
social avoidance. In contrast, endocrine and neuroimmune responses to 
uncontrollable stress were unaffected, indicating a selective impact of prior 
dominance. Together, these data demonstrate that instrumental control over 
stress promotes later dominance, but also reveal that winning experiences buffer 
against the neural and behavioral outcomes of future adversity.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543982

enhanced quantitative perfusion (DCEQP) MRI sequences assessing iron deposition 
and vascular permeability were previously correlated with new hemorrhage in 
cavernous angiomas. We assessed their prospective changes in cavernous angiomas 
with symptomatic hemorrhage (CASH) in a multisite trial readiness project ( 
clinicaltrials.gov NCT03652181 ).
METHODS: Patients with CASH in the prior year, without prior or planned lesion 
resection or irradiation were enrolled. Mean QSM and DCEQP of CASH lesion were 
acquired at baseline, and at 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Sensitivity and 
specificity of biomarker changes were analyzed in relation to predefined 
lesional symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) or asymptomatic change (AC). Sample size 
calculations for hypothesized therapeutic effects were conducted.
RESULTS: We logged 143 QSM and 130 DCEQP paired annual assessments. Annual QSM 
change was greater in cases with SH than in cases without SH (p= 0.019). Annual 
QSM increase by ≥ 6% occurred in 7 of 7 cases (100%) with recurrent SH and in 7 
of 10 cases (70%) with AC during the same epoch, and 3.82 times more frequently 
than clinical events. DCEQP change had lower sensitivity for SH and AC than QSM 
change, and greater variance. A trial with smallest sample size would detect a 
30% difference in QSM annual change in 34 or 42 subjects (one and two-tailed, 
respectively), power 0.8, alpha 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of QSM change is feasible and sensitive to recurrent 
bleeding in CASH. Evaluation of an intervention on QSM percent change may be 
used as a time-averaged difference between 2 arms using a repeated measures 
analysis. DCEQP change is associated with lesser sensitivity and higher 
variability than QSM. These results are the basis of an application for

Preprint.","Sleep disruption precedes forebrain synaptic Tau burden and contributes to 
cognitive decline in a sex-dependent manner in the P301S Tau transgenic mouse 
model.","Martin SC, Joyce KK, Harper KM, Nikolova VD, Cohen TJ, Moy SS, Diering GH.","BACKGROUND: Sleep is an essential process that supports brain health and 
cognitive function in part through the modification of neuronal synapses. Sleep 
disruption, and impaired synaptic processes, are common features in 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
casual role of sleep disruption in disease progression is not clear. 
Neurofibrillary tangles, made from hyperphosphorylated and aggregated Tau 
protein, form one of the major hallmark pathologies seen in AD and contribute to 
cognitive decline, synapse loss and neuronal death.Tau has been shown to 
aggregate in synapses which may impair restorative synapse processes occurring 
during sleep. However, it remains unclear how sleep disruption and synaptic Tau 
pathology interact to drive cognitive decline. It is also unclear whether the 
sexes show differential vulnerability to the effects of sleep loss in the 
context of neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We used a piezoelectric home-cage monitoring system to measure sleep 
behavior in 3-11month-old transgenic hTau P301S Tauopathy model mice (PS19) and 
littermate controls of both sexes. Subcellular fractionation and Western blot 
was used to examine Tau pathology in mouse forebrain synapse fractions. To 
examine the role of sleep disruption in disease progression, mice were exposed 
to acute or chronic sleep disruption. The Morris water maze test was used to 
measure spatial learning and memory performance.
RESULTS: PS19 mice exhibited a selective loss of sleep during the dark phase, 
referred to as hyperarousal, as an early symptom with an onset of 3months in 
females and 6months in males. At 6months, forebrain synaptic Tau burden did not 
correlate with sleep measures and was not affected by acute or chronic sleep 
disruption. Chronic sleep disruption accelerated the onset of decline of 
hippocampal spatial memory in PS19 males, but not females.
CONCLUSIONS: Dark phase hyperarousal is an early symptom in PS19 mice that 
precedes robust Tau aggregation. We find no evidence that sleep disruption is a 
direct driver of Tau pathology in the forebrain synapse. However, sleep 
disruption synergized with Tau pathology to accelerate the onset of cognitive 
decline in males. Despite the finding that hyperarousal appears earlier in 
females, female cognition was resilient to the effects of sleep disruption.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544101

Preprint.","The Caulobacter NtrB-NtrC two-component system bridges nitrogen assimilation and 
cell development.","North H, McLaughlin M, Fiebig A, Crosson S.","A suite of molecular sensory systems enables Caulobacter to control growth, 
development, and reproduction in response to levels of essential elements. The 
enhancer binding protein NtrC and its cognate sensor histidine kinase NtrB are 
well-established regulators of nitrogen assimilation in bacteria, but their 
precise functions in Caulobacter metabolism and cell development remain largely 
undefined. Deletion of C. crescentus ntrC slowed cell growth in complex medium, 
while ntrB and ntrC were essential for growth when ammonium was the sole 
nitrogen source due to their requirement for glutamine synthase ( glnA ) 
expression. Random transposition of a conserved IS3-family mobile genetic 
element frequently rescued the growth defect of ntrC mutant strains by restoring 
transcription of the glnBA operon, revealing a possible role for IS3 
transposition in shaping the evolution of Caulobacter populations during 
nitrogen limitation. The chromosome of C. crescentus harbors dozens of NtrC 
binding sites, with a large fraction located near genes involved in 
polysaccharide biosynthesis. The majority of NtrC binding sites align with those 
of the nucleoid associated protein, GapR, an essential protein involved in 
chromosome organization, or MucR1, a cell cycle regulator. Thus, NtrC is 
predicted to directly impact the regulation of cell cycle and cell development. 
Indeed, loss of NtrC function led to elongated polar stalks and elevated 
synthesis of cell envelope polysaccharides. These phenotypes were rescued by 
supplementing media with glutamine or by ectopic expression of the glnBA operon. 
This study establishes regulatory connections between NtrC, nitrogen metabolism, 
polar morphogenesis, and envelope polysaccharide synthesis in Caulobacter .
IMPORTANCE: Bacteria balance metabolic and developmental processes with the 
availability of essential nutrients in their environment. The NtrB-NtrC 
two-component signaling system is responsible for controlling nitrogen 
assimilation in many bacteria. We have defined the growth defects of Caulobacter 
ntrB and ntrC mutants and uncovered a role for spontaneous IS element 
transposition in the rescue of transcriptional and nutritional deficiencies 
caused by ntrC mutation. We further defined the regulon of Caulobacter NtrC, a 
bacterial enhancer binding protein, and demonstrate that it shares specific 
binding sites with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and chromosome 
organization. Our work provides a comprehensive view of transcriptional 
regulation mediated by a distinctive NtrC protein, establishing its connection 
to nitrogen assimilation and developmental processes in Caulobacter .","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543975

Preprint.",The PALB2 DNA binding domain is an intrinsically disordered recombinase.,"Kyriukha Y, Watkins MB, Redington JM, Dastvan R, Hopkins J, Pozzi N, Korolev S.","Tumor suppressor Pa rtner and L ocalizer of B RCA 2 (PALB2) is a scaffold 
protein that links BRCA1, BRCA2 and other DNA repair factors and plays a crucial 
role in homologous recombination (HR). The interaction of PALB2 with DNA 
strongly enhances the efficiency of HR. Importantly, the PALB2 DNA-binding 
domain (PALB2-DBD) supports strand exchange of DNA or RNA, a complex multistep 
reaction carried by only a few protein families like RecA-like recombinases or 
Rad52. The mechanisms of PALB2 DNA binding and strand exchange are unknown. 
Through circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic spectroscopy and small-angle 
X-ray scattering, we found that the PALB2-DBD is intrinsically disordered, even 
when bound to DNA. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are prevalent in the 
human proteome and have many important biological functions. The advanced level 
of complexity of the strand exchange reaction significantly expands the 
functional repertoire of IDPs. Using confocal single-molecule FRET, we found 
that PALB2-DBD binding leads to oligomerization-dependent compaction of DNA. We 
hypothesize that PALB2-DBD uses a ""chaperone-like"" mechanism to aid formation 
and resolution of complex DNA and RNA multichain intermediates during DNA 
replication and repair. Similar DNA-binding IDRs may represent a novel class of 
functional domains evolved in eukaryotic nucleic acids metabolism complexes.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543259

Preprint.","Catalytic activity of the Bin3/MEPCE methyltransferase domain is dispensable for 
7SK snRNP function in Drosophila melanogaster.","Palumbo RJ, Hanes SD.","Methylphosphate Capping Enzyme (MEPCE) monomethylates the gamma phosphate at the 
5' end of the 7SK noncoding RNA, a modification thought to protect 7SK from 
degradation. 7SK serves as a scaffold for assembly of a snRNP complex that 
inhibits transcription by sequestering the positive elongation factor P-TEFb. 
While much is known about the biochemical activity of MEPCE in vitro , little is 
known about its functions in vivo , or what roles- if any-there are for regions 
outside the conserved methyltransferase domain. Here, we investigated the role 
of Bin3, the Drosophila ortholog of MEPCE, and its conserved functional domains 
in Drosophila development. We found that bin3 mutant females had strongly 
reduced rates of egg-laying, which was rescued by genetic reduction of P-TEFb 
activity, suggesting that Bin3 promotes fecundity by repressing P-TEFb. bin3 
mutants also exhibited neuromuscular defects, analogous to a patient with MEPCE 
haploinsufficiency. These defects were also rescued by genetic reduction of 
P-TEFb activity, suggesting that Bin3 and MEPCE have conserved roles in 
promoting neuromuscular function by repressing P-TEFb. Unexpectedly, we found 
that a Bin3 catalytic mutant (Bin3 Y795A ) could still bind and stabilize 7SK 
and rescue all bin3 mutant phenotypes, indicating that Bin3 catalytic activity 
is dispensable for 7SK stability and snRNP function in vivo . Finally, we 
identified a metazoan-specific motif (MSM) outside of the methyltransferase 
domain and generated mutant flies lacking this motif (Bin3 ΔMSM ). Bin3 ΔMSM 
mutant flies exhibited some-but not all- bin3 mutant phenotypes, suggesting that 
the MSM is required for a 7SK-independent, tissue-specific function of Bin3.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543302

Preprint.","Differential usage of DNA modifications in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia.","Tooley KB, Chucair-Elliott AJ, Ocañas SR, Machalinski AH, Pham KD, Stanford DR, 
Freeman WM.","BACKGROUND: Cellular identity is determined partly by cell type-specific 
epigenomic profiles that regulate gene expression. In neuroscience, there is a 
pressing need to isolate and characterize the epigenomes of specific CNS cell 
types in health and disease. This is especially true as for DNA modifications 
where most data are derived from bisulfite sequencing that cannot differentiate 
between DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation. In this study, we developed an 
in vivo tagging mouse model (Camk2a-NuTRAP) for paired isolation of neuronal DNA 
and RNA without cell sorting and then used this model to assess epigenomic 
regulation of gene expression between neurons and glia.
RESULTS: After validating the cell-specificity of the Camk2a-NuTRAP model, we 
performed TRAP-RNA-Seq and INTACT whole genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing to 
assess the neuronal translatome and epigenome in the hippocampus of young mice 
(3 months old). These data were then compared to microglial and astrocytic data 
from NuTRAP models. When comparing the different cell types, microglia had the 
highest global mCG levels followed by astrocytes and then neurons, with the 
opposite pattern observed for hmCG and mCH. Differentially modified regions 
between cell types were predominantly found within gene bodies and distal 
intergenic regions, with limited differences occurring within proximal 
promoters. Across cell types there was a negative correlation between DNA 
modifications (mCG, mCH, hmCG) and gene expression at proximal promoters. In 
contrast, a negative correlation of mCG with gene expression within the gene 
body while a positive relationship between distal promoter and gene body hmCG 
and gene expression was observed. Furthermore, we identified a neuron-specific 
inverse relationship between mCH and gene expression across promoter and gene 
body regions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified differential usage of DNA 
modifications across CNS cell types, and assessed the relationship between DNA 
modifications and gene expression in neurons and glia. Despite having different 
global levels, the general modification-gene expression relationship was 
conserved across cell types. The enrichment of differential modifications in 
gene bodies and distal regulatory elements, but not proximal promoters, across 
cell types highlights epigenomic patterning in these regions as potentially 
greater determinants of cell identity.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543497

Preprint.","The microbial derived bile acid lithocholate and its epimers inhibit 
Clostridioides difficile growth and pathogenicity while sparing members of the

the indigenous gut microbiota and causes the loss of microbial derived secondary 
bile acids that normally provide protection against C. difficile colonization. 
Previous work has shown that the secondary bile acid lithocholate (LCA) and its 
epimer isolithocholate (iLCA) have potent inhibitory activity against clinically 
relevant C. difficile strains. To further characterize the mechanisms by which 
LCA and its epimers iLCA and isoallolithocholate (iaLCA) inhibit C. difficile, 
we tested their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against C. difficile 
R20291, and a commensal gut microbiota panel. We also performed a series of 
experiments to determine the mechanism of action by which LCA and its epimers 
inhibit C. difficile through bacterial killing and effects on toxin expression 
and activity. Here we show that epimers iLCA and iaLCA strongly inhibit C. 
difficile growth in vitro while sparing most commensal Gram-negative gut 
microbes. We also show that iLCA and iaLCA have bactericidal activity against C. 
difficile, and these epimers cause significant bacterial membrane damage at 
subinhibitory concentrations. Finally, we observe that iLCA and iaLCA decrease 
the expression of the large cytotoxin tcdA while LCA significantly reduces toxin 
activity. Although iLCA and iaLCA are both epimers of LCA, they have distinct 
mechanisms for inhibiting C. difficile . LCA epimers, iLCA and iaLCA, represent 
promising compounds that target C. difficile with minimal effects on members of 
the gut microbiota that are important for colonization resistance.
IMPORTANCE: In the search for a novel therapeutic that targets C. difficile , 
bile acids have become a viable solution. Epimers of bile acids are particularly 
attractive as they may provide protection against C. difficile while leaving the 
indigenous gut microbiota largely unaltered. This study shows that iLCA and 
iaLCA specifically are potent inhibitors of C. difficile , affecting key 
virulence factors including growth, toxin expression and activity. As we move 
toward the use of bile acids as therapeutics, further work will be required to 
determine how best to deliver these bile acids to a target site within the host 
intestinal tract.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543867

evidence for the importance of SEL1L in HRD1 ERAD is lacking. Here we report 
that attenuation of the interaction between SEL1L and HRD1 impairs HRD1 ERAD 
function and has pathological consequences in mice. Our data show that SEL1L 
variant p.Ser658Pro ( SEL1L S 658 P ) previously identified in Finnish Hound 
suffering cerebellar ataxia is a recessive hypomorphic mutation, causing partial

RNA, RT, and host tRNA3 Lys . We therefore sought to identify co-evolutionary 
changes between the 5'-leader and RT in viruses developing RT-inhibitor 
resistance mutations.
METHODS: We sequenced 5'-leader positions 37-356 of paired plasma virus samples 
from 29 individuals developing the NRTI-resistance mutation M184V, 19 developing 
an NNRTI-resistance mutation, and 32 untreated controls. 5'-leader variants were 
defined as positions where ≥20% of NGS reads differed from the HXB2 sequence. 
Emergent mutations were defined as nucleotides undergoing ≥4-fold change in 
proportion between baseline and follow-up. Mixtures were defined as positions 
containing ≥2 nucleotides each present in ≥20% of NGS reads.
RESULTS: Among 80 baseline sequences, 87 positions (27.2%) contained a variant; 
52 contained a mixture. Position 201 was the only position more likely to 
develop a mutation in the M184V (9/29 vs. 0/32; p=0.0006) or NNRTI-resistance 
(4/19 vs. 0/32; p=0.02; Fisher's Exact Test) groups than the control group. 
Mixtures at positions 200 and 201 occurred in 45.0% and 28.8%, respectively, of 
baseline samples. Because of the high proportion of mixtures at these positions, 
we analyzed 5'-leader mixture frequencies in two additional datasets: five 
publications reporting 294 dideoxyterminator clonal GenBank sequences from 42 
individuals and six NCBI BioProjects reporting NGS datasets from 295 
individuals. These analyses demonstrated position 200 and 201 mixtures at 
proportions similar to those in our samples and at frequencies several times 
higher than at all other 5'-leader positions.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we did not convincingly document co-evolutionary changes 
between RT and 5'-leader sequences, we identified a novel phenomenon, wherein 
positions 200 and 201, immediately downstream of the HIV-1 primer binding site 
exhibited an extraordinarily high likelihood of containing a nucleotide mixture. 
Possible explanations for the high mixture rates are that these positions are 
particularly error-prone or provide a viral fitness advantage.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.04.23290942

patients avoid events within 24 months of diagnosis (EFS24) and the remainder 
have poor outcomes. Recent genetic and molecular classification of DLBCL has 
advanced our knowledge of disease biology, yet were not designed to predict 
early events and guide anticipatory selection of novel therapies. To address 
this unmet need, we used an integrative multiomic approach to identify a 
signature at diagnosis that will identify DLBCL at high risk of early clinical 
failure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor biopsies from 444 newly diagnosed DLBCL were 
analyzed by WES and RNAseq. A combination of weighted gene correlation network 
analysis and differential gene expression analysis followed by integration with 
clinical and genomic data was used to identify a multiomic signature associated 
with high risk of early clinical failure.
RESULTS: Current DLBCL classifiers are unable to discriminate cases who fail 
EFS24. We identified a high risk RNA signature that had a hazard ratio (HR, 
18.46 [95% CI 6.51-52.31] P < .001) in a univariate model, which did not 
attenuate after adjustment for age, IPI and COO (HR, 20.8 [95% CI, 7.14-61.09] P 
< .001). Further analysis revealed the signature was associated with metabolic 
reprogramming and a depleted immune microenvironment. Finally, WES data was 
integrated into the signature and we found that inclusion of ARID1A mutations 
resulted in identification of 45% of cases with an early clinical failure which 
was validated in external DLBCL cohorts.
CONCLUSION: This novel and integrative approach is the first to identify a

scattering profiles that are in quantitative agreement with SAXS experiments as 
well as chemical shifts that are consistent with NMR. We also show that COFFEE 
accurately describes the salt-induced unraveling of nucleosomes. Strikingly, our 
nucleosome simulations explain the destabilization effect of ARG to LYS 
mutations, which does not alter the balance of electrostatic interactions, but 
affects chemical interactions in subtle ways. The range of applications attests 
to the transferability of COFFEE, and we anticipate that it is a promising 
framework for simulating DNA-protein complexes at the molecular length-scale.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544064

contributor to immune cell-mediated neuropathology in neurodegenerative 
diseases. Recently, we demonstrated a robust upregulation of type I 
interferon-stimulated genes in microglia and astrocytes following experimental 
traumatic brain injury (TBI). The specific molecular and cellular mechanisms by 
which IFN-I signaling impacts the neuroimmune response and neuropathology 
following TBI remains unknown. Using the lateral fluid percussion injury model 
(FPI) in adult male mice, we demonstrated that IFN α/β receptor (IFNAR)

interferon-stimulated genes following TBI as well as decreased microgliosis and 
monocyte infiltration. Phenotypic alteration of reactive microglia also occurred 
with diminished expression of molecules needed for MHC class I antigen

accumulation of cytotoxic T cells in the brain. The IFNAR-dependent modulation 
of the neuroimmune response was accompanied by protection from secondary 
neuronal death, white matter disruption, and neurobehavioral dysfunction. These

Preprint.","Endodermal cells use contact inhibition of locomotion to achieve uniform cell 
dispersal during zebrafish gastrulation.","LaBelle J, Wyatt T, Woo S.","The endoderm is one of the three primary germ layers that ultimately gives rise 
to the gastrointestinal and respiratory epithelia and other tissues. In 
zebrafish and other vertebrates, endodermal cells are initially highly migratory 
with only transient interactions among one other, but later converge together to 
form an epithelial sheet. Here, we show that during their early, migratory 
phase, endodermal cells actively avoid each other through contact inhibition of 
locomotion (CIL), a characteristic response consisting of 1) actin 
depolymerization and membrane retraction at the site of contact, 2) preferential 
actin polymerization along a cell-free edge, and 3) reorientation of migration 
away from the other cell. We found that this response is dependent on the Rho 
GTPase RhoA and EphA/ephrin-A signaling - expression of dominant-negative (DN) 
RhoA or treatment with the EphA inhibitor dasatinib resulted in behaviors 
consistent with loss of CIL, including increased contact duration times and 
decreased likelihood of migration reorientation after contact. Computational 
modeling predicted that CIL is required to achieve the efficient and uniform 
dispersal characteristic of endodermal cells. Consistent with our model, we 
found that loss of CIL via DN RhoA expression resulted in irregular clustering 
of cells within the endoderm. Together, our results suggest that endodermal 
cells use EphA2- and RhoA-dependent CIL as a cell dispersal and spacing 
mechanism, demonstrating how local interactions can give rise to tissue-scale 
patterns.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543209

Parenchyma to Small Airways Disease in COPD.","Bell AJ, Ram S, Labaki WW, Hoff BA, Wang JM, Murray S, Kazerooni EA, Galban S, 
Lynch DA, Humphries SM, Martinez FJ, Hatt CR, Han MK, Galban CJ.","PURPOSE: Small airways disease (SAD), a major cause of airflow obstruction in 
COPD patients, has been identified as a precursor to emphysema. Nevertheless, 
there is a lack of clinical techniques that can quantify the progression of SAD. 
We aim to determine if our Parametric Response Mapping (PRM) method to quantify 
SAD offers insight into lung progression from healthy to emphysema.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PRM metrics quantifying normal lung (PRM Norm ) and 
functional SAD (PRM fSAD ) were generated from CT scans collected as part of the 
COPDGene study (n=8956). Volume density (V) and Euler-Poincaré Characteristic 
(χ) maps, measures of extent and coalescence of pocket formations, respectively, 
were determined for both PRM Norm and PRM fSAD . Association with COPD severity, 
emphysema, and spirometric measures were assessed via multivariable regression 
models.
RESULTS: Across all GOLD, we observed a strong linear correlation between χ fSAD 
and χ Norm (ρ =-0.745, p<0.001). Values of χ fSAD and χ Norm were found to flip 
signs in unison between GOLD 2 and 4, demonstrating an inversion in parenchymal 
topology. For subjects with COPD, multivariable analysis showed that both χ fSAD 
(β of 0.106, p<0.001) and V fSAD (β of 0.065, p=0.004) were independently 
associated with FEV 1 % predicted. V and χ measures for PRM fSAD and PRM Norm 
were independently associated with the amount of emphysema.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that χ of fSAD and Norm have independent value when 
associated with lung function and emphysema, even when considering the amount of 
each (i.e., V fSAD , V Norm ). Our approach for quantifying pocket formations of 
PRM fSAD from normal lung parenchyma (PRM Norm ) may show promise as a CT 
readout of emphysema onset.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.26.23290532

into behavior.","Parks DF, Schneider AM, Xu Y, Brunwasser SJ, Funderburk S, Thurber D, Blanche T, 
Dyer EL, Haussler D, Hengen KB.","Sleep and wake are understood to be slow, long-lasting processes that span the 
entire brain. Brain states correlate with many neurophysiological changes, yet 
the most robust and reliable signature of state is enriched in rhythms between 
0.1 and 20 Hz. The possibility that the fundamental unit of brain state could be 
a reliable structure at the scale of milliseconds and microns has not been 
addressable due to the physical limits associated with oscillation-based 
definitions. Here, by analyzing high resolution neural activity recorded in 10 
anatomically and functionally diverse regions of the murine brain over 24 h, we 
reveal a mechanistically distinct embedding of state in the brain. Sleep and 
wake states can be accurately classified based in 10 0 to 10 1 ms of neuronal 
activity sampled from 100 μm of brain tissue. In contrast to canonical rhythms, 
this embedding persists above 1,000 Hz. This latent fast embedding is robust to 
substates and nested neurophysiological events. To ascertain whether such fast 
and local structure is meaningful, we leveraged our observation that individual 
circuits intermittently switch states independently of the rest of the brain. 
Brief state discontinuities in subsets of circuits correspond with brief 
behavioral discontinuities during both sleep and wake. Our results suggest that 
the fundamental unit of state in the brain is consistent with the spatial and 
temporal scale of neuronal computation, and that this resolution can contribute 
to an understanding of cognition and behavior.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544399

signaling and reactive microglia/macrophage on the formation Müller 
glial-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the retinas of fish, birds and mice. 
We generated scRNA-seq libraries to identify transcriptional changes in Müller 
glia (MG) that result from the depletion of microglia from the chick retina. We 
found significant changes in different networks of genes in MG in normal and 
damaged retinas when the microglia are ablated. We identified a failure of MG to 
upregulate Wnt-ligands, Heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF), 
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), retinoic acid receptors and genes related to 
Notch-signaling. Inhibition of GSK3β, to simulate Wnt-signaling, failed to 
rescue the deficit in formation of proliferating MGPCs in damaged retinas 
missing microglia. By comparison, application of HBEGF or FGF2 completely 
rescued the formation of proliferating MGPCs in microglia-depleted retinas. 
Similarly, injection of a small molecule inhibitor to Smad3 or agonist to 
retinoic acid receptors partially rescued the formation of proliferating MGPCs 
in microglia-depleted damaged retinas. According to scRNA-seq libraries, 
patterns of expression of ligands, receptors, signal transducers and/or 
processing enzymes to cell-signaling via HBEGF, FGF, retinoic acid and TGFβ are 
rapidly and transiently upregulated by MG after neuronal damage, consistent with 
important roles for these cell-signaling pathways in regulating the formation of 
MGPCs. We conclude that quiescent and activated microglia have a significant 
impact upon the transcriptomic profile of MG. We conclude that signals produced 
by reactive microglia in damaged retinas stimulate MG to upregulate cell 
signaling through HBEGF, FGF and retinoic acid, and downregulate signaling 
through TGFβ/Smad3 to promote the reprogramming on MG into proliferating MGPCs.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544205

Y, Ruderfer DM.","Patients with schizophrenia have substantial comorbidity contributing to reduced 
life expectancy of 10-20 years. Identifying which comorbidities might be 
modifiable could improve rates of premature mortality in this population. We 
hypothesize that conditions that frequently co-occur but lack shared genetic 
risk with schizophrenia are more likely to be products of treatment, behavior, 
or environmental factors and therefore potentially modifiable. To test this 
hypothesis, we calculated phenome-wide comorbidity from electronic health 
records (EHR) in 250,000 patients in each of two independent health care 
institutions (Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Mass General Brigham) and 
association with schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS) across the same 
phenotypes (phecodes) in linked biobanks. Comorbidity with schizophrenia was 
significantly correlated across institutions (r = 0.85) and consistent with 
prior literature. After multiple test correction, there were 77 significant 
phecodes comorbid with schizophrenia. Overall, comorbidity and PRS association 
were highly correlated (r = 0.55, p = 1.29×10 -118 ), however, 36 of the EHR 
identified comorbidities had significantly equivalent schizophrenia PRS 
distributions between cases and controls. Fifteen of these lacked any PRS 
association and were enriched for phenotypes known to be side effects of 
antipsychotic medications (e.g., ""movement disorders"", ""convulsions"", 
""tachycardia"") or other schizophrenia related factors such as from smoking 
(""bronchitis"") or reduced hygiene (e.g., ""diseases of the nail"") highlighting 
the validity of this approach. Other phenotypes implicated by this approach 
where the contribution from shared common genetic risk with schizophrenia was 
minimal included tobacco use disorder, diabetes, and dementia. This work 
demonstrates the consistency and robustness of EHR-based schizophrenia 
comorbidities across independent institutions and with the existing literature. 
It identifies comorbidities with an absence of shared genetic risk indicating 
other causes that might be more modifiable and where further study of causal 
pathways could improve outcomes for patients.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.23290057

anti-depressant drug-like activities in mice.","Pogorelov VM, Rodriguiz RM, Roth BL, Wetsel WC.","There is now evidence from multiple Phase II clinical trials that psychedelic 
drugs can exert long-lasting anxiolytic, anti-depressant, and anti-drug abuse 
(nicotine and ethanol) effects in patients. Despite these benefits, the 
hallucinogenic actions of these drugs at the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) 
limit their clinical use in diverse settings. Activation of the 5-HT2AR can 
stimulate both G protein and β-arrestin (βArr) -mediated signaling. Lisuride is 
a G protein biased agonist at the 5-HT2AR and, unlike the structurally-related 
LSD, the drug does not typically produce hallucinations in normal subjects at 
routine doses. Here, we examined behavioral responses to lisuride, in wild-type 
(WT), βArr1-KO, and βArr2-KO mice. In the open field, lisuride reduced locomotor 
and rearing activities, but produced a U-shaped function for stereotypies in 
both βArr lines of mice. Locomotion was decreased overall in βArr1-KOs and 
βArr2-KOs, relative to WT controls. Incidences of head twitches and retrograde 
walking to lisuride were low in all genotypes. Grooming was depressed in βArr1 
mice, but was increased then decreased in βArr2 animals with lisuride. Prepulse 
inhibition (PPI) was unaffected in βArr2 mice, whereas 0.5 mg/kg lisuride 
disrupted PPI in βArr1 animals. The 5-HT2AR antagonist MDL100907 failed to 
restore PPI in βArr1 mice, whereas the dopamine D2/D3 antagonist raclopride 
normalized PPI in WTs but not in βArr1-KOs. Using vesicular monoamine 
transporter 2 mice, lisuride reduced immobility times in tail suspension and 
promoted a preference for sucrose that lasted up to 2 days. Together, it appears 
βArr1 and βArr2 play minor roles in lisuride's actions on many behaviors, while

Induced Death (REID). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
has adopted Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs) to limit the probability of REID 
to 3% for the risk of death due to radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The most 
significant contributor to current REID estimates for astronauts is the risk of 
lung cancer. Recently updated lung cancer estimates from Japan's atomic bomb 
survivors showed that the excess relative risk of lung cancer by age 70 is 
roughly four-fold higher in females compared to males. However, whether sex 
differences may impact the risk of lung cancer due to exposure to high charge 
and energy (HZE) radiation is not well studied. Thus, to evaluate the impact of 
sex differences on the risk of solid cancer development post-HZE radiation 
exposure, we irradiated Rb fl/fl ; Trp53 fl/+ male and female mice infected with 
Adeno-Cre with various doses of 320 kVp X-rays or 600 MeV/n 56 Fe ions and

addition, 1 Gy 56 Fe ion exposure compared to X-rays led to a significantly 
higher incidence of lung adenomas/carcinomas (p=0.02) and ENBs (p<0.0001). 
However, we did not find a significantly higher incidence of any solid

quality. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of ENBs suggested a distinct gene 
expression pattern with similar hallmark pathways altered, such as MYC targets

virulence, in part by increasing bacterial survival during exposure to lethal 
concentrations of H 2 O 2 , a crucial host defense against S. aureus . We now 
report that protection by agr surprisingly extends beyond post-exponential 
growth to the exit from stationary phase when the agr system is no longer turned 
on. Thus, agr can be considered a constitutive protective factor. Deletion of 
agr increased both respiration and aerobic fermentation but decreased ATP levels 
and growth, suggesting that Δ agr cells assume a hyperactive metabolic state in 
response to reduced metabolic efficiency. As expected from increased respiratory 
gene expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated more in the agr 
mutant than in wild-type cells, thereby explaining elevated susceptibility of Δ 
agr strains to lethal H 2 O 2 doses. Increased survival of wild-type agr cells 
during H 2 O 2 exposure required sodA , which detoxifies superoxide. 
Additionally, pretreatment of S. aureus with respiration-reducing menadione 
protected Δ agr cells from killing by H 2 O 2 . Thus, genetic deletion and 
pharmacologic experiments indicate that agr helps control endogenous ROS, 
thereby providing resilience against exogenous ROS. The long-lived ""memory"" of 
agr -mediated protection, which is uncoupled from agr activation kinetics, 
increased hematogenous dissemination to certain tissues during sepsis in

expression using MRI. LSAqp1 is a fusion protein composed of aquaporin-1 and a 
degradation tag that is sensitive to a cell-permeable ligand, which allows for 
dynamic small molecule modulation of MRI signals. LSAqp1 improves specificity 
for imaging gene expression by allowing reporter signals to be conditionally 
activated and distinguished from the tissue background by difference imaging. In

requirements, it is possible to image distinct cell types simultaneously.

Preprint.",A Quantitative Analysis of Locomotor Patterns in Developing C. elegans.,"Hassinan CW, Sterrett SC, Summy B, Khera A, Wang A, Bai J.","Adult animals display robust locomotion, yet the timeline and mechanisms of how 
juvenile animals acquire coordinated movements and how these movements evolve 
during development are not well understood. Recent advances in quantitative 
behavioral analyses have paved the way for investigating complex natural 
behaviors like locomotion. In this study, we tracked the swimming and crawling 
behaviors of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from postembryonic development 
through to adulthood. Our principal component analyses revealed that adult C. 
elegans swimming is low dimensional, suggesting that a small number of distinct 
postures, or eigenworms, account for most of the variance in the body shapes 
that constitute swimming behavior. Additionally, we found that crawling behavior 
in adult C. elegans is similarly low dimensional, corroborating previous 
studies. However, our analysis revealed that swimming and crawling are distinct 
gaits in adult animals, clearly distinguishable within the eigenworm space. 
Remarkably, young L1 larvae are capable of producing the postural shapes for 
swimming and crawling seen in adults, despite frequent instances of 
uncoordinated body movements. In contrast, late L1 larvae exhibit robust 
coordination of locomotion, while many neurons crucial for adult locomotion are 
still under development. In conclusion, this study establishes a comprehensive 
quantitative behavioral framework for understanding the neural basis of 
locomotor development, including distinct gaits such as swimming and crawling in 
C. elegans .","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.03.543584

Preprint.","Heritable epigenetic changes are constrained by the dynamics of regulatory 
architectures.",Jose AM.,"Interacting molecules create regulatory architectures that can persist despite 
turnover of molecules. Although epigenetic changes occur within the context of 
such architectures, there is limited understanding of how they can influence the 
heritability of changes. Here I develop criteria for the heritability of 
regulatory architectures and use quantitative simulations of interacting 
regulators parsed as entities, their sensors and the sensed properties to 
analyze how architectures influence heritable epigenetic changes. Information 
contained in regulatory architectures grows rapidly with the number of 
interacting molecules and its transmission requires positive feedback loops. 
While these architectures can recover after many epigenetic perturbations, some 
resulting changes can become permanently heritable. Such stable changes can (1) 
alter steady-state levels while preserving the architecture, (2) induce 
different architectures that persist for many generations, or (3) collapse the 
entire architecture. Architectures that are otherwise unstable can become 
heritable through periodic interactions with external regulators, which suggests 
that the evolution of mortal somatic lineages with cells that reproducibly 
interact with the immortal germ lineage could make a wider variety of regulatory 
architectures heritable. Differential inhibition of the positive feedback loops 
that transmit regulatory architectures across generations can explain the 
gene-specific differences in heritable RNA silencing observed in the nematode C. 
elegans , which range from permanent silencing, to recovery from silencing 
within a few generations and subsequent resistance to silencing. More broadly, 
these results provide a foundation for analyzing the inheritance of epigenetic 
changes within the context of the regulatory architectures implemented using 
diverse molecules in different living systems.
SIGNIFICANCE: Regulatory interactions in living systems are recreated in 
successive generations. Practical ways of analyzing how the information required 
for this recreation is transmitted across generations and how it can be changed 
are lacking. Simulating all heritable information by parsing regulatory 
interactions in terms of entities, their sensors, and the sensed properties 
reveals the minimal requirements for the heritability of regulatory interactions 
and how they influence the inheritance of epigenetic changes. Application of 
this approach can explain recent experimental results on the inheritance of RNA 
silencing across generations in the nematode C. elegans . Since all interactors 
can be abstracted as entity-sensor-property systems, similar analyses can be 
widely used to understand heritable epigenetic changes.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544138

Preprint.",Antigen perception in T cells by long-term Erk and NFAT signaling dynamics.,"Wither MJ, White WL, Pendyala S, Leanza PJ, Fowler D, Kueh HY.","Immune system threat detection hinges on T cells' ability to perceive varying 
peptide major-histocompatibility complex (pMHC) antigens. As the Erk and NFAT 
pathways link T cell receptor engagement to gene regulation, their signaling 
dynamics may convey information about pMHC inputs. To test this idea, we 
developed a dual reporter mouse strain and a quantitative imaging assay that, 
together, enable simultaneous monitoring of Erk and NFAT dynamics in live T 
cells over day-long timescales as they respond to varying pMHC inputs. Both 
pathways initially activate uniformly across various pMHC inputs, but diverge 
only over longer (9+ hrs) timescales, enabling independent encoding of pMHC 
affinity and dose. These late signaling dynamics are decoded via multiple 
temporal and combinatorial mechanisms to generate pMHC-specific transcriptional 
responses. Our findings underscore the importance of long timescale signaling 
dynamics in antigen perception, and establish a framework for understanding T 
cell responses under diverse contexts.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: To counter diverse pathogens, T cells mount distinct 
responses to varying peptide-major histocompatibility complex ligands (pMHCs). 
They perceive the affinity of pMHCs for the T cell receptor (TCR), which 
reflects its foreignness, as well as pMHC abundance. By tracking signaling 
responses in single living cells to different pMHCs, we find that T cells can 
independently perceive pMHC affinity vs dose, and encode this information 
through the dynamics of Erk and NFAT signaling pathways downstream of the TCR. 
These dynamics are jointly decoded by gene regulatory mechanisms to produce 
pMHC-specific activation responses. Our work reveals how T cells can elicit 
tailored functional responses to diverse threats and how dysregulation of these 
responses may lead to immune pathologies.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543260

J.","BACKGROUND: Debates on the allocation of medical resources during the COVID-19 
pandemic revealed the need for a better understanding of immunologic risk. 
Studies highlighted variable clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 
individuals with defects in both adaptive and innate immunity, suggesting 
additional contributions from other factors. Notably, none of these studies 
controlled for variables linked with social determinants of health.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the contributions of determinants of health to risk of 
hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals with inborn errors of 
immunodeficiencies.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study of 166 individuals 
with inborn errors of immunity, aged two months through 69 years, who developed 
SARS-CoV-2 infections from March 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Risks of 
hospitalization was assessed using a multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The risk of SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization was associated with 
underrepresented racial and ethnic populations (odds ratio [OR] 5.29; confidence 
interval [CI], 1.76-17.0), a diagnosis of any genetically-defined 
immunodeficiency (OR 4.62; CI, 1.60-14.8), use of B cell depleting therapy 
within one year of infection (OR 6.1; CI, 1.05-38.5), obesity (OR 3.74; CI, 
1.17-12.5), and neurologic disease (OR 5.38; CI, 1.61-17.8). COVID-19 
vaccination was associated with reduced hospitalization risk (OR 0.52; CI, 
0.31-0.81). Defective T cell function, immune-mediated organ dysfunction, and 
social vulnerability were not associated with increased risk of hospitalization 
after controlling for covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: The associations between race, ethnicity, and obesity with 
increased risk of hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection indicate the 
importance of variables linked with social determinants of health as immunologic 
risk factors for individuals with inborn errors of immunity.
HIGHLIGHTS: What is already known about this topic? Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 
infections in individuals with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are highly 
variable. Prior studies of patients with IEI have not controlled for race or 
social vulnerability. What does this article add to our knowledge ? For 
individuals with IEI, hospitalizations for SARS-CoV-2 were associated with race, 
ethnicity, obesity, and neurologic disease. Specific types of immunodeficiency, 
organ dysfunction, and social vulnerability were not associated with increased 
risk of hospitalization. How does this study impact current management 
guidelines? Current guidelines for the management of IEIs focus on risk 
conferred by genetic and cellular mechanisms. This study highlights the 
importance of considering variables linked with social determinants of health 
and common comorbidities as immunologic risk factors.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.23290843

tissue changes and enables enhanced understanding of numerous diseases. However, 
this modality suffers from low signal arising from limitations imposed by the 
maximum permissible dose of illumination and the need for rapid image 
acquisition to avoid motion artifacts. Recently, deep learning methods have been 
developed to facilitate the extraction of quantitative information from such 
images. Here, we employ deep neural architectures in the synthesis of a 
multiscale denoising algorithm optimized for restoring metrics of metabolic 
activity from low-SNR, two-photon images. Two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) 
images of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and 
flavoproteins (FAD) from freshly excised human cervical tissues are used. We 
assess the impact of the specific denoising model, loss function, data 
transformation, and training dataset on established metrics of image restoration 
when comparing denoised single frame images with corresponding six frame 
averages, considered as the ground truth. We further assess the restoration 
accuracy of six metrics of metabolic function from the denoised images relative 
to ground truth images. Using a novel algorithm based on deep denoising in the

metrics. Our results highlight the promise of denoising algorithms to recover 
diagnostically useful information from low SNR label-free two-photon images and 
their potential importance in the clinical translation of such imaging.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544033

P, Manson JE, Whitsel EA, Eaton CB.","BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) was recently 
identified as a risk factor for incident heart failure (HF). Whether CHIP is 
associated selectively with risk of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) subtypes is 
unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether CHIP is associated with incident HF subtypes, 
HFrEF versus HFpEF.
METHODS: We obtained CHIP status from whole genome sequencing of blood DNA in 
participants without prevalent HF from a multi-ethnic sample of post-menopausal 
women without prevalent HF (N=5,214) from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). 
Cox proportional hazards models were performed, adjusting for demographic and 
clinical risk factors.
RESULTS: CHIP was significantly associated with a 42% (95%CI 6%, 91%) increased 
risk of HFpEF (P=0.02). In contrast, there was no evidence of association 
between CHIP and risk of incident HFrEF. When the three most common CHIP 
subtypes were assessed individually, the risk of HFpEF was more strongly 
associated with TET2 (HR=2.5; 95%CI 1.54, 4.06; P<0.001), than DNMT3A or ASXL1.

Perturbation-based balance training (PBT), a form of rehabilitation that 
intentionally introduces small, unpredictable disruptions to an individual's 
gait cycle, can improve balance. The Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) is a 
cable-driven robotic trainer that applies perturbations to the user's pelvis 
during treadmill walking. Earlier work showcased improved gait stability and the 
first evidence of increased cognition acutely. The mobile Tethered Pelvic Assist 
Device (mTPAD), a portable version of the TPAD, applies perturbations to a 
pelvic belt via a posterior walker during overground gait, as opposed to 
treadmill walking. Forty healthy older adults were randomly assigned to a 
control group (CG, n = 20) without mTPAD PBT or an experimental group (EG, 
n = 20) with mTPAD PBT for a two-day study. Day 1 consisted of baseline 
anthropometrics, vitals, and functional and cognitive measurements. Day 2 
consisted of training with the mTPAD and post-interventional cognitive and

Preprint.",DNA damage primes hematopoietic stem cells for direct megakaryopoiesis.,"Garyn CM, Bover O, Murray JW, Jing M, Salas-Briceno K, Ross SR, Snoeck HW.","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow (BM), can self-renew, 
and generate all cells of the hematopoietic system. 1 Most hematopoietic 
lineages arise through successive, increasingly lineage-committed progenitors. 
In contrast, megakaryocytes (MKs), hyperploid cells that generate platelets 
essential to hemostasis, can derive rapidly and directly from HSCs. 2 The 
underlying mechanism is unknown however. Here we show that DNA damage and 
subsequent arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle rapidly induce MK commitment 
specifically in HSCs, but not in progenitors, through an initially predominantly 
post-transcriptional mechanism. Cycling HSCs show extensive replication-induced 
DNA damage associated with uracil misincorporation in vivo and in vitro . 
Consistent with this notion, thymidine attenuated DNA damage, rescued HSC 
maintenance and reduced the generation of CD41 + MK-committed HSCs in vitro . 
Similarly, overexpression of the dUTP-scavenging enzyme, dUTPase, enhanced in 
vitro maintenance of HSCs. We conclude that a DNA damage response drives direct 
megakaryopoiesis and that replication stress-induced direct megakaryopoiesis, at 
least in part caused by uracil misincorporation, is a barrier to HSC maintenance 
in vitro . DNA damage-induced direct megakaryopoiesis may allow rapid generation 
of a lineage essential to immediate organismal survival, while simultaneously 
removing damaged HSCs and potentially avoiding malignant transformation of 
self-renewing stem cells.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.13.540665

Preprint.",Differential dynamics specify MeCP2 function at methylated DNA and nucleosomes.,"Chua GNL, Watters JW, Olinares PDB, Luo JA, Chait BT, Liu S.","Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is an essential chromatin-binding protein 
whose mutations cause Rett syndrome (RTT), a leading cause of monogenic 
intellectual disabilities in females. Despite its significant biomedical 
relevance, the mechanism by which MeCP2 navigates the chromatin epigenetic 
landscape to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression remains unclear. 
Here, we used correlative single-molecule fluorescence and force microscopy to 
directly visualize the distribution and dynamics of MeCP2 on a variety of DNA 
and chromatin substrates. We found that MeCP2 exhibits differential diffusion 
dynamics when bound to unmethylated and methylated bare DNA. Moreover, we 
discovered that MeCP2 preferentially binds nucleosomes within the context of 
chromatinized DNA and stabilizes them from mechanical perturbation. The distinct 
behaviors of MeCP2 at bare DNA and nucleosomes also specify its ability to 
recruit TBLR1, a core component of the NCoR1/2 co-repressor complex. We further 
examined several RTT mutations and found that they disrupt different aspects of 
the MeCP2-chromatin interaction, rationalizing the heterogeneous nature of the 
disease. Our work reveals the biophysical basis for MeCP2's 
methylation-dependent activities and suggests a nucleosome-centric model for its

the Center for Open Bioimage Analysis (COBA), Bioimaging North America (BINA), 
and the Royal Microscopical Society Data Analysis in Imaging Section (RMS DAIM) 
to understand the needs of the imaging community. Through multi-choice and 
open-ended questions, the survey inquired about demographics, image analysis 
experiences, future needs, and suggestions on the role of tool developers and 
users. Participants of the survey were from diverse roles and domains of the 
life and physical sciences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to 
survey cross-community to bridge knowledge gaps between physical and life 
sciences imaging. Survey results indicate that respondents' overarching needs 
are documentation, detailed tutorials on the usage of image analysis tools, 
user-friendly intuitive software, and better solutions for segmentation, ideally 
in a format tailored to their specific use cases. The tool creators suggested 
the users familiarize themselves with the fundamentals of image analysis, 
provide constant feedback, and report the issues faced during image analysis 
while the users would like more documentation and an emphasis on tool 
friendliness. Regardless of the computational experience, there is a strong 
preference for 'written tutorials' to acquire knowledge on image analysis. We 
also observed that the interest in having 'office hours' to get an expert 
opinion on their image analysis methods has increased over the years. In 
addition, the community suggests the need for a common repository for the 
available image analysis tools and their applications. The opinions and 
suggestions of the community, released here in full, will help the image 
analysis tool creation and education communities to design and deliver the 
resources accordingly.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543701

Preprint.","Common computations in automatic cue combination and metacognitive confidence 
reports.","Gao Y, Xue K, Odegaard B, Rahnev D.","Appropriate perceptual decision making necessitates the accurate estimation and 
use of sensory uncertainty. Such estimation has been studied in the context of 
both low-level multisensory cue combination and metacognitive estimation of 
confidence, but it remains unclear whether the same computations underlie both 
sets of uncertainty estimation. We created visual stimuli with low vs. high 
overall motion energy, such that the high-energy stimuli led to higher 
confidence but lower accuracy in a visual-only task. Importantly, we tested the 
impact of the low- and high-energy visual stimuli on auditory motion perception 
in a separate task. Despite being irrelevant to the auditory task, both visual 
stimuli impacted auditory judgments presumably via automatic low-level 
mechanisms. Critically, we found that the high-energy visual stimuli influenced 
the auditory judgments more strongly than the low-energy visual stimuli. This 
effect was in line with the confidence but contrary to the accuracy differences 
between the high- and low-energy stimuli in the visual-only task. These effects 
were captured by a simple computational model that assumes common computational 
principles underlying both confidence reports and multisensory cue combination. 
Our results reveal a deep link between automatic sensory processing and 
metacognitive confidence reports, and suggest that vastly different stages of

Residue Correlation Networks.","Chang CE, Hung TI, Hsieh YJ, Lu WL, Wu KP.","Identifying critical residues in protein-protein binding and efficiently 
designing stable and specific protein binders to target another protein is 
challenging. In addition to direct contacts in a protein-protein binding 
interface, our study employs computation modeling to reveal the essential 
network of residue interaction and dihedral angle correlation critical in 
protein-protein recognition. We propose that mutating residues regions exhibited 
highly correlated motions within the interaction network can efficiently 
optimize protein-protein interactions to create tight and selective protein 
binders. We validated our strategy using ubiquitin (Ub) and MERS coronaviral 
papain-like protease (PLpro) complexes, where Ub is one central player in many 
cellular functions and PLpro is an antiviral drug target. Molecular dynamics 
simulations and experimental assays were used to predict and verify our designed 
Ub variant (UbV) binders. Our designed UbV with 3 mutated residues resulted in a 
~3,500-fold increase in functional inhibition, compared with the wild-type Ub. 
Further optimization by incorporating 2 more residues within the network, the 
5-point mutant achieved a KD of 1.5 nM and IC50 of 9.7 nM. The modification led 
to a 27,500-fold and 5,500-fold enhancements in affinity and potency, 
respectively, as well as improved selectivity, without destabilizing the UbV 
structure. Our study illustrates the importance of residue correlation and 
interaction networks in protein-protein interaction and introduces a new

health-promoting effects of exercise throughout the body. Yet, the mechanisms by 
which beneficial information is transmitted from extracellular vesicles to 
recipient cells are poorly understood, precluding a holistic understanding of 
how exercise promotes cellular and tissue health. In this study, using articular 
cartilage as a model, we introduced a network medicine paradigm to simulate how 
exercise facilitates communication between circulating EVs and chondrocytes, the 
cells resident in articular cartilage. Using the archived small RNA-seq data of 
EV before and after aerobic exercise, microRNA regulatory network analysis based 
on network propagation inferred that circulating EVs activated by aerobic 
exercise perturb chondrocyte-matrix interactions and downstream cellular aging 
processes. Building on the mechanistic framework identified through 
computational analyses, follow up experimental studies interrogated the direct 
influence of exercise on EV-mediated chondrocyte-matrix interactions. We found 
that pathogenic matrix signaling in chondrocytes was abrogated in the presence 
of exercise-primed EVs, restoring a more youthful phenotype, as determined by 
chondrocyte morphological profiling and evaluation of chondrogenicity. 
Epigenetic reprograming of the gene encoding the longevity protein, α-Klotho,

transduces rejuvenation signals to circulating EVs, endowing EVs with the

Addressing the conspicuous void of efficacious in vitro or animal models for

and 64 promising small molecule candidates for NIHL protection. Afatinib and 
zorifertinib, both inhibitors of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), 
were validated for their protective efficacy against NIHL in experimental 
zebrafish and murine models. This protective effect was further confirmed with 
EGFR conditional knockout mice and EGF knockdown zebrafish, both demonstrating

toward its implementation: a survey.","Zhong AY, Lui AJ, Katz MS, Berlin A, Kamran SC, Kishan AU, Murthy V, Nagar H, 
Seible D, Stish BJ, Tree AC, Seibert TM.","BACKGROUND: In a recent phase III randomized control trial (FLAME), delivering a 
focal radiotherapy (RT) boost to tumors visible on MRI was shown to improve 
outcomes for prostate cancer patients without increasing toxicity. The aim of 
this study was to assess how widely this technique is being applied in current 
practice as well as physicians' perceived barriers toward its implementation.
METHODS: An online survey assessing the use of intraprostatic focal boost was 
conducted in December 2022 and February 2023. The survey link was distributed to 
radiation oncologists worldwide via email list, group text platform, and social 
media.
RESULTS: The survey initially collected 205 responses from various countries 
over a two-week period in December 2022. The survey was then reopened for one 
week in February 2023 to allow for more participation, leading to a total of 263 
responses. The highest-represented countries were the United States (42%), 
Mexico (13%), and the United Kingdom (8%). The majority of participants worked 
at an academic medical center (52%) and considered their practice to be at least 
partially genitourinary (GU)-subspecialized (74%). 57% of participants reported 
not routinely using intraprostatic focal boost. Even among complete 
subspecialists, a substantial proportion (39%) do not routinely use focal boost. 
Less than half of participants in both high-income and low-to-middle-income 
countries were shown to routinely use focal boost. The most commonly cited 
barriers were concerns about registration accuracy between MRI and CT (37%), 
concerns about risk of additional toxicity (35%), and challenges to accessing 
high-quality MRI (29%).
CONCLUSION: Despite level 1 evidence from the FLAME trial, most radiation 
oncologists surveyed are not routinely offering focal RT boost. Adoption of this 
technique might be accelerated by increased access to high-quality MRI, better 
registration algorithms of MRI to CT simulation images, physician education on 
benefit-to-harm ratio, and training on contouring prostate lesions on MRI.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.01.23285345

Patients with infections, active malignancy, or any history of transplantation 
were excluded. In 238 healthy controls, median cTfh percentages (range 4.8% -

of macromolecules, typically consisting of bond-forming ""stickers"" connected by

the rigid holoenzyme Rubisco and its flexible partner EPYC1. Remarkably, halving 
EPYC1 linker lengths decreases critical concentrations by ten-fold. We attribute 
this difference to the molecular ""fit"" between EPYC1 and Rubisco. Varying 
Rubisco sticker locations reveals that the native sites yield the poorest fit, 
thus optimizing phase separation. Surprisingly, shorter linkers mediate a 
transition to a gas of rods as Rubisco stickers approach the poles. These

selective BCL-2 inhibitor, on human B-ALL using both single-agent and 
combinatorial treatments. The combination treatment of fedratinib and venetoclax 
improved killing of the human B-ALL cell lines RS4;11 and SUPB-15 in vitro over 
single-agent treatments. This combinatorial effect was not detected in the human 
B-ALL cell line NALM-6, which was less responsive to fedratinib due to the 
absence of Flt3 expression. The combination treatment induces a unique gene 
expression profile relative to single-agent treatment and with an enrichment in 
apoptotic pathways. Finally, the combination treatment was superior to single 
agent treatment in an in vivo xenograft model of human B-ALL with a two-week 
treatment regimen significantly improving overall survival. Overall, our data 
demonstrates the efficacy of a combinatorial treatment strategy of fedratinib

preterm labor (PL). In prior drug discovery efforts, we identified mundulone and 
its analog mundulone acetate (MA) as inhibitors of in vitro intracellular Ca 2+ 
-regulated myometrial contractility. In this study, we probed the tocolytic and 
therapeutic potential of these small molecules using myometrial cells and 
tissues obtained from patients receiving cesarean deliveries, as well as a mouse 
model of PL resulting in preterm birth. In a phenotypic assay, mundulone 
displayed greater efficacy in the inhibition of intracellular-Ca 2+ from 
myometrial cells; however, MA showed greater potency and uterine-selectivity, 
based IC 50 and E max values between myometrial cells compared to aorta vascular 
smooth muscle cells, a major maternal off-target site of current tocolytics. 
Cell viability assays revealed that MA was significantly less cytotoxic. Organ 
bath and vessel myography studies showed that only mundulone exerted 
concentration-dependent inhibition of ex vivo myometrial contractions and that 
neither mundulone or MA affected vasoreactivity of ductus arteriosus, a major 
fetal off-target of current tocolytics. A high-throughput combination screen of 
in vitro intracellular Ca 2+ -mobilization identified that mundulone exhibits 
synergism with two clinical-tocolytics (atosiban and nifedipine), and MA 
displayed synergistic efficacy with nifedipine. Of these synergistic 
combinations, mundulone + atosiban demonstrated a favorable in vitro therapeutic 
index (TI)=10, a substantial improvement compared to TI=0.8 for mundulone alone. 
The ex vivo and in vivo synergism of mundulone and atosiban was substantiated, 
yielding greater tocolytic efficacy and potency on isolated mouse and human 
myometrial tissue and reduced preterm birth rates in a mouse model of PL 
compared to each single agent. Treatment with mundulone 5hrs after mifepristone 
administration (and PL induction) dose-dependently delayed the timing of 
delivery. Importantly, mundulone in combination with atosiban (FR 3.7:1, 
6.5mg/kg + 1.75mg/kg) permitted long-term management of PL after induction with 
30 μg mifepristone, allowing 71% dams to deliver viable pups at term (> day 19, 
4-5 days post-mifepristone exposure) without any visible maternal and fetal 
consequences. Collectively, these studies provide a strong foundation for the

established chr6p22.2-21.32 HLA region, we identified pleiotropic regions on 
chr3q28 near OSTN and chr19q13.32 near APOE that were enriched for

and Mendelian Randomization and identified 42 putative causal proteins for AD, 
15 of which have drugs available. Finally, we developed a proteomics-based risk 
score for AD that outperforms genetics-based polygenic risk scores. These 
findings will be instrumental to further understand the biology and identify 
causal and druggable proteins for brain and neurological traits.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2814616/v1

plays a pivotal role in disease progression and metastasis and could provide 
novel opportunities for patient treatment. Macrophages are the most abundant 
immune cells in the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) and are capable of 
killing tumor cells. To identify genes in the tumor cells that are critical for 
macrophage-mediated killing, we performed a genome-wide co-culture CRISPR screen 
and identified AR, PRKCD, and multiple components of the NF-κB pathway as hits, 
whose expression in the tumor cell are essential for being targeted and killed 
by macrophages. These data position AR signaling as an immunomodulator, and 
confirmed by androgen-deprivation experiments, that rendered hormone-deprived 
tumor cells resistant to macrophage-mediated killing. Proteomic analyses showed 
a downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in the PRKCD- and IKBKG-KO cells 
compared to the control, suggesting impaired mitochondrial function, which was 
confirmed by electron microscopy analyses. Furthermore, phosphoproteomic 
analyses revealed that all hits impaired ferroptosis signaling, which was 
validated transcriptionally using samples from a neoadjuvant clinical trial with 
the AR-inhibitor enzalutamide. Collectively, our data demonstrate that AR 
functions together with the PRKCD and the NF-κB pathway to evade 
macrophage-mediated killing. As hormonal intervention represents the mainstay 
therapy for treatment of prostate cancer patients, our findings may have direct 
implications and provide a plausible explanation for the clinically observed 
persistence of tumor cells despite androgen deprivation therapy.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543873

Phelps AM, Cook AP, Phelps JS, Erginkaya M, Lee WA, Card GM, Daly KC, Dacks AM.","Natural behaviors are a coordinated symphony of motor acts which drive 
self-induced or reafferent sensory activation. Single sensors only signal 
presence and magnitude of a sensory cue; they cannot disambiguate exafferent 
(externally-induced) from reafferent sources. Nevertheless, animals readily 
differentiate between these sources of sensory signals to make appropriate 
decisions and initiate adaptive behavioral outcomes. This is mediated by 
predictive motor signaling mechanisms, which emanate from motor control pathways 
to sensory processing pathways, but how predictive motor signaling circuits 
function at the cellular and synaptic level is poorly understood. We use a 
variety of techniques, including connectomics from both male and female electron 
microscopy volumes, transcriptomics, neuroanatomical, physiological and 
behavioral approaches to resolve the network architecture of two pairs of 
ascending histaminergic neurons (AHNs), which putatively provide predictive 
motor signals to several sensory and motor neuropil. Both AHN pairs receive 
input primarily from an overlapping population of descending neurons, many of 
which drive wing motor output. The two AHN pairs target almost exclusively 
non-overlapping downstream neural networks including those that process visual, 
auditory and mechanosensory information as well as networks coordinating wing, 
haltere, and leg motor output. These results support the conclusion that the AHN 
pairs multi-task, integrating a large amount of common input, then tile their 
output in the brain, providing predictive motor signals to non-overlapping 
sensory networks affecting motor control both directly and indirectly.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544074

revealed by proximal proteome mapping in human muscle cells.","Ray A, Wen J, Yammine L, Culver J, Garren J, Xue L, Hales K, Xiang Q, Birnbaum 
MJ, Zhang BB, Monetti M, McGraw TE.","Regulation of glucose transport into muscle and adipocytes, central for control 
of whole-body metabolism, is determined by the amount of GLUT4 glucose 
transporter in the plasma membrane ( PM ). Physiologic signals (activated 
insulin receptor or AMP kinase [ AMPK ]), acutely increase PM GLUT4 to enhance 
glucose uptake. Here we show in kinetic studies that intracellular GLUT4 is in 
equilibrium with the PM in unstimulated cultured human skeletal muscle cells, 
and that AMPK promotes GLUT4 redistribution to the PM by regulating both 
exocytosis and endocytosis. AMPK-stimulation of exocytosis requires Rab10 and 
Rab GTPase activating protein TBC1D4, requirements shared with insulin control 
of GLUT4 in adipocytes. Using APEX2 proximity mapping, we identify, at 
high-density and high-resolution, the GLUT4 proximal proteome, revealing GLUT4 
traverses both PM proximal and distal compartments in unstimulated muscle cells. 
These data support intracellular retention of GLUT4 in unstimulated muscle cells 
by a dynamic mechanism dependent on the rates of internalization and recycling. 
AMPK promoted GLUT4 translocation to the PM involves redistribution of GLUT4 
among the same compartments traversed in unstimulated cells, with a significant 
redistribution of GLUT4 from the PM distal Trans Golgi Network Golgi 
compartments. The comprehensive proximal protein mapping provides an integrated, 
whole cell accounting of GLUT4's localization at a resolution of ∼20 nm, a

trafficking downstream of different signaling inputs in physiologically relevant

Pathogenicity in Chronic Intestinal Inflammation.","Bamidele AO, Mishra SK, Hirsova P, Fehrenbach PJ, Valenzuela-Pérez L, Kim Lee 
HS.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Incapacitated regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute to 
immune-mediated diseases. Inflammatory Tregs are evident during human 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, mechanisms driving the development of 
these cells and their function are not well understood. Therefore, we 
investigated the role of cellular metabolism in Tregs relevant to gut 
homeostasis.
METHODS: Using human Tregs, we performed mitochondrial ultrastructural studies 
via electron microscopy and confocal imaging, biochemical and protein analyses 
using proximity ligation assay, immunoblotting, mass cytometry and 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting, metabolomics, gene expression analysis, and 
real-time metabolic profiling utilizing Seahorse XF analyzer. We utilized 
Crohn's disease single-cell RNA sequencing dataset to infer therapeutic 
relevance of targeting metabolic pathways in inflammatory Tregs. We examined the 
superior functionality of genetically-modified Tregs in CD4 + T cell-induced 
murine colitis models.
RESULTS: Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) appositions, known to mediate 
pyruvate entry into mitochondria via VDAC1, are abundant in Tregs. VDAC1 
inhibition perturbed pyruvate metabolism, eliciting sensitization to other 
inflammatory signals reversible by membrane-permeable methyl pyruvate (MePyr) 
supplementation. Notably, IL-21 diminished mitochondria-ER appositions, 
resulting in enhanced enzymatic function of glycogen synthase kinase 3 β 
(GSK3β), a putative negative regulator of VDAC1, and a hypermetabolic state that 
amplified Treg inflammatory response. MePyr and GSK3β pharmacologic inhibitor 
(LY2090314) reversed IL-21-induced metabolic rewiring and inflammatory state. 
Moreover, IL-21-induced metabolic genes in Tregs in vitro were enriched in human 
Crohn's disease intestinal Tregs. Adoptively transferred Il21r -/- Tregs 
efficiently rescued murine colitis in contrast to wild-type Tregs.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-21 triggers metabolic dysfunction associated with Treg 
inflammatory response. Inhibiting IL-21-induced metabolism in Tregs may mitigate 
CD4 + T cell-driven chronic intestinal inflammation.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543518

Preprint.","Direct measurement of dynamic attractant gradients reveals breakdown of the 
Patlak-Keller-Segel chemotaxis model.","Phan TV, Mattingly HH, Vo L, Marvin JS, Looger LL, Emonet T.","Chemotactic bacteria not only navigate chemical gradients, but also shape their 
environments by consuming and secreting attractants. Investigating how these 
processes influence the dynamics of bacterial populations has been challenging 
because of a lack of experimental methods for measuring spatial profiles of 
chemoattractants in real time. Here, we use a fluorescent sensor for aspartate 
to directly measure bacterially generated chemoattractant gradients during 
collective migration. Our measurements show that the standard 
Patlak-Keller-Segel model for collective chemotactic bacterial migration breaks 
down at high cell densities. To address this, we propose modifications to the 
model that consider the impact of cell density on bacterial chemotaxis and 
attractant consumption. With these changes, the model explains our experimental 
data across all cell densities, offering new insight into chemotactic dynamics. 
Our findings highlight the significance of considering cell density effects on 
bacterial behavior, and the potential for fluorescent metabolite sensors to shed 
light on the complex emergent dynamics of bacterial communities.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: During collective cellular processes, cells often 
dynamically shape and respond to their chemical environments. Our understanding 
of these processes is limited by the ability to measure these chemical profiles 
in real time. For example, the Patlak-Keller-Segel model has widely been used to 
describe collective chemotaxis towards self-generated gradients in various 
systems, albeit without direct verification. Here we used a biocompatible 
fluorescent protein sensor to directly observe attractant gradients created and 
chased by collectively-migrating bacteria. Doing so uncovered limitations of the 
standard chemotaxis model at high cell densities and allowed us to establish an 
improved model. Our work demonstrates the potential for fluorescent protein 
sensors to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of chemical environments in 
cellular communities.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543315

S.","The Ebola virus (EBOV) transcriptional regulation involves host protein 
phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, which dephosphorylate the transcriptional cofactor of 
EBOV polymerase VP30. The 1E7-03 compound, which targets PP1, induces VP30 
phosphorylation and inhibits EBOV infection. This study aimed to investigate the 
role of PP1 in EBOV replication. When EBOV-infected cells were continuously 
treated with 1E7-03, the NP E619K mutation was selected. This mutation 
moderately reduced EBOV minigenome transcription, which was restored by the 
treatment with 1E7-03. Formation of EBOV capsids, when NP was co-expressed with 
VP24 and VP35, was impaired with NPE 619K. Treatment with 1E7-03 restored capsid 
formation by NP E619K mutation, but inhibited capsids formed by WT NP. The 
dimerization of NP E619K, tested in a split NanoBiT assay, was significantly 
decreased (~ 15-fold) compared to WT NP. NP E619K bound more efficiently to PP1 
(~ 3-fold) but not B56 subunit of PP2A or VP30. Cross-linking and 
co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed fewer monomers and dimers for NP E619K 
which were increased with 1E7-03 treatment. NP E619K showed increased 
co-localization with PP1α compared to WT NP. Mutations of potential PP1 binding 
sites and NP deletions disrupted its interaction with PP1. Collectively, our 
findings suggest that PP1 binding to the NP regulates NP dimerization and capsid 
formation, and that NP E619K mutation, which has the enhanced PP1 binding, 
disrupts these processes. Our results point to a new role for PP1 in EBOV 
replication in which NP binding to PP1 may facilitate viral transcription by 
delaying capsid formation and EBOV replication.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2963943/v1

However, adenoviral vectored (AdV) vaccines may be less immunogenic than mRNA 
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. We assessed anti-spike and anti-vector immunity 
among infection-naïve Health Care Workers (HCW) following two doses of AdV 
(AZD1222) versus mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine. 183 AdV and 274 mRNA vaccinees 
enrolled between April and October 2021. Median ages were 42 and 39 years, 
respectively. Blood was collected at least once, 10-48 days after vaccine dose 
2. Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and spike binding antibody titres 
were a median of 4.2 and 2.2 times lower, respectively, for AdV compared to mRNA 
vaccinees (p<0.001). Median percentages of memory B cells that recognized 
fluorescent-tagged spike and RBD were 2.9 and 8.3 times lower, respectively for 
AdV compared to mRNA vaccinees. Titres of IgG reactive with human Adenovirus 
type 5 hexon protein rose a median of 2.2-fold after AdV vaccination but were 
not correlated with anti-spike antibody titres. Together the results show that

Modifications in Individual Ion Mass Spectrometry Data.","Faizi M, Fellers RT, Lu D, Drown BS, Jambhekar A, Lahav G, Kelleher NL, 
Gunawardena J.","MOTIVATION: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins regulate protein 
structures and functions. A single protein molecule can possess multiple 
modification sites that can accommodate various PTM types, leading to a variety 
of different patterns, or combinations of PTMs, on that protein. Different PTM 
patterns can give rise to distinct biological functions. To facilitate the study 
of multiple PTMs, top-down mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to be a useful tool 
to measure the mass of intact proteins, thereby enabling even widely separated 
PTMs to be assigned to the same protein molecule and allowing determination of 
how many PTMs are attached to a single protein.
RESULTS: We developed a Python module called MSModDetector that studies PTM 
patterns from individual ion mass spectrometry (I MS) data. I MS is an intact 
protein mass spectrometry approach that generates true mass spectra without the 
need to infer charge states. The algorithm first detects and quantifies mass 
shifts for a protein of interest and subsequently infers potential PTM patterns 
using linear programming. The algorithm is evaluated on simulated I MS data and 
experimental I MS data for the tumor suppressor protein p53. We show that 
MSModDetector is a useful tool for comparing a protein's PTM pattern landscape 
across different conditions. An improved analysis of PTM patterns will enable a 
deeper understanding of PTM-regulated cellular processes.

particularly for patients unresponsive to conventional treatments, is 
increasingly recognized. A core symptom of depression, anhedonia, or the loss of 
enjoyment or interest in previously pleasurable activities, is known to be 
significantly alleviated by ketamine. While several hypotheses have been 
proposed regarding the mechanisms by which ketamine alleviates anhedonia, the 
specific circuits and synaptic changes responsible for its sustained therapeutic 
effects are not yet understood. Here, we show that the nucleus accumbens (NAc), 
a major hub of the reward circuitry, is essential for ketamine's effect in 
rescuing anhedonia in mice subjected to chronic stress, a critical risk factor 
in the genesis of depression in humans. Specifically, a single exposure to 
ketamine rescues stress-induced decreased strength of excitatory synapses on NAc 
D1 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs). By using a novel 
cell-specific pharmacology method, we demonstrate that this cell-type specific 
neuroadaptation is necessary for the sustained therapeutic effects of ketamine. 
To test for causal sufficiency, we artificially mimicked ketamine-induced 
increase in excitatory strength on D1-MSNs and found that this recapitulates the 
behavioral amelioration induced by ketamine. Finally, to determine the 
presynaptic origin of the relevant glutamatergic inputs for ketamine-elicited 
synaptic and behavioral effects, we used a combination of opto- and 
chemogenetics. We found that ketamine rescues stress-induced reduction in 
excitatory strength at medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus inputs 
to NAc D1-MSNs. Chemogenetically preventing ketamine-evoked plasticity at those 
unique inputs to the NAc reveals a ketamine-operated input-specific control of 
hedonic behavior. These results establish that ketamine rescues stress-induced 
anhedonia via cell-type-specific adaptations as well as information integration 
in the NAc via discrete excitatory synapses.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544088

S.","Background : Balancing autonomy and supervision during medical residency is 
important for trainee development while ensuring patient safety. In the modern 
clinical learning environment, tension exists when this balance is skewed. This 
study aimed to understand the current and ideal states of autonomy and 
supervision, then describe the factors that contribute to imbalance from both 
trainee and attending perspectives. Methods : A mixed-methods design included 
surveys and focus groups of trainees and attendings at three institutionally 
affiliated hospitals between May 2019-June 2020. Survey responses were compared 
using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Open-ended survey and focus 
group questions were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results : Surveys were 
sent to 182 trainees and 208 attendings; 76 trainees (42%) and 101 attendings 
(49%) completed the survey. Fourteen trainees (8%) and 32 attendings (32%) 
participated in focus groups. Trainees perceived the current culture to be 
significantly more autonomous than attendings; both groups described an ""ideal"" 
culture as more autonomous than the current state. Focus group analysis revealed 
five core contributors to the balance of autonomy and supervision: attending-, 
trainee-, patient-, interpersonal-, and institutional-related factors. These 
factors were found to be dynamic and interactive with each other. Additionally, 
we identified a cultural shift in how the modern inpatient environment is 
impacted by increased hospitalist attending supervision and emphasis on patient 
safety and health system improvement initiatives. Conclusions : Trainees and 
attendings agree that the clinical learning environment should favor resident 
autonomy and that the current environment does not achieve the ideal balance. 
There are several factors contributing to autonomy and supervision, including 
attending-, resident-, patient-, interpersonal-, and institutional-related. 
These factors are complex, multifaceted, and dynamic. Cultural shifts towards 
supervision by primarily hospitalist attendings and increased attending 
accountability for patient safety and systems improvement outcomes further 
impacts trainee autonomy.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2982838/v1

Preprint.","Analysis of RNA Exosome Subunit Transcript Abundance Across Tissues: 
Implications for Neurological Disease Pathogenesis.","de Amorim JL, Asafu-Adjaye D, Corbett AH.","Exosomopathies are a collection of rare diseases caused by mutations in genes 
that encode structural subunits of a ribonuclease complex termed the RNA 
exosome. The RNA exosome mediates both RNA processing and degradation of 
multiple classes of RNA. This complex is evolutionarily conserved and required 
for fundamental cellular functions, including rRNA processing. Recently, 
missense mutations in genes encoding structural subunits of the RNA exosome 
complex have been linked to a variety of distinct neurological diseases, many of 
them childhood neuronopathies with at least some cerebellar atrophy. 
Understanding how these missense mutations lead to the disparate clinical 
presentations that have been reported for this class of diseases necessitates 
investigation of how these specific changes alter cell-specific RNA exosome 
function. Although the RNA exosome complex is routinely referred to as 
ubiquitously expressed, little is known about the tissue- or cell-specific 
expression of the RNA exosome complex or any individual subunit. Here, we 
leverage publicly available RNA-sequencing data to analyze RNA exosome subunit 
transcript levels in healthy human tissues, focusing on those tissues that are 
impacted in exosomopathy patients described in clinical reports. This analysis 
provides evidence to support the characterization of the RNA exosome as 
ubiquitously expressed with transcript levels for the individual subunits that 
vary in different tissues. However, the cerebellar hemisphere and cerebellum 
have high levels of nearly all RNA exosome subunit transcripts. These findings 
could suggest that the cerebellum has a high requirement for RNA exosome 
function and potentially explain why cerebellar pathology is common in RNA 
exosomopathies.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544082

Preprint.","A hypothetical intervention to reduce inequities in anxiety for Multiracial 
people: simulating an intervention on childhood adversity.","Lam-Hine T, Bradshaw PT, Allen AM, Omi M, Riddell CA.","Multiracial people report higher mean Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) 
scores and prevalence of anxiety than other racial groups. Studies using 
statistical interactions to estimate racial differences in ACEs-anxiety 
associations do not show stronger associations for Multiracial people. Using 
data from Waves 1 (1995-97) through 4 (2008-09) of the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we simulated a stochastic 
intervention over 1,000 resampled datasets to estimate the race-specific cases 
averted per 1,000 of anxiety if all racial groups had the same exposure 
distribution of ACEs as Whites. Simulated cases averted were greatest for the 
Multiracial group, (median = -4.17 cases per 1,000, 95% CI: -7.42, -1.86). The 
model also predicted smaller risk reductions for Black participants (-0.76, 95% 
CI: -1.53, -0.19). CIs around estimates for other racial groups included the 
null. An intervention to reduce racial disparities in exposure to ACEs could 
help reduce the inequitable burden of anxiety on the Multiracial population.

Preprint.","Methoxsalen inhibited the acquisition of nicotine self-administration: 
attenuation by cotinine replacement in rats.","Ding ZM, Neslund EM, Sun D, Tan X.","Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of disease and death. 
Nicotine is the primary reinforcing ingredient in cigarettes sustaining 
addiction. Cotinine is the major metabolite of nicotine that produces a myriad 
of neurobehavioral effects. Cotinine supported self-administration and rats with 
a history of intravenous self-administration of cotinine exhibited relapse-like 
drug-seeking behavior, suggesting cotinine may also be reinforcing. To date, a 
potential contribution of cotinine to nicotine reinforcement remains unknown. 
Nicotine metabolism is mainly catalyzed by hepatic CYP2B1 enzyme in the rat and 
methoxsalen is a potent CYP2B1 inhibitor. The study tested the hypothesis that 
methoxsalen inbibits nicotine metabolism and self-administration, and that 
cotinine replacement attenuates the inhibitory effects of methoxsalen. Acute 
methoxsalen decreased plasma cotinine levels and increased nicotine levels 
following subcutaneous nicotine injection. Repeated methoxsalen reduced the 
acquisition of nicotine self-administration, leading to fewer nicotine 
infusions, disruption of lever differentiation, smaller total nicotine intake, 
and lower plasma cotinine levels. On the other hand, methoxsalen did not alter 
nicotine self-administration during the maintenance phase despite great 
reduction of plasma cotinine levels. Cotinine replacement by mixing cotinine 
with nicotine for self-administration dose-dependently increased plasma cotinine 
levels, counteracted effects of methoxsalen, and enhanced the acquisition of 
self-administration. Neither basal nor nicotine-induced locomotor activity was 
altered by methoxsalen. These results indicate that methoxsalen depressed 
cotinine formation from nicotine and the acquisition of nicotine 
self-administration, and that replacement of plasma cotinine attenuated the 
inhibitory effects of methoxsalen, suggesting that cotinine may contribute to 
the development of nicotine reinforcement.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.04.543614

Suresh S, Hain BA, Regan J, Ofer R, Wright L, Robling A, Cao X, Alliston T, 
Marks AR, Waning DL, Mohammad KS, Guise TA.","SUMMARY: Zoledronic acid (ZA) prevents muscle weakness in mice with bone 
metastases; however, its role in muscle weakness in non-tumor-associated 
metabolic bone diseases and as an effective treatment modality for the 
prevention of muscle weakness associated with bone disorders, is unknown. We 
demonstrate the role of ZA-treatment on bone and muscle using a mouse model of 
accelerated bone remodeling, which represents the clinical manifestation of 
non-tumor associated metabolic bone disease. ZA increased bone mass and strength 
and rescued osteocyte lacunocanalicular organization. Short-term ZA treatment 
increased muscle mass, whereas prolonged, preventive treatment improved muscle 
mass and function. In these mice, muscle fiber-type shifted from oxidative to 
glycolytic and ZA restored normal muscle fiber distribution. By blocking TGFβ 
release from bone, ZA improved muscle function, promoted myoblast 
differentiation and stabilized Ryanodine Receptor-1 calcium channel. These data 
demonstrate the beneficial effects of ZA in maintaining bone health and 
preserving muscle mass and function in a model of metabolic bone disease.
CONTEXT AND SIGNIFICANCE: TGFβ is a bone regulatory molecule which is stored in 
bone matrix, released during bone remodeling, and must be maintained at an 
optimal level for the good health of the bone. Excess TGFβ causes several bone 
disorders and skeletal muscle weakness. Reducing excess TGFβ release from bone 
using zoledronic acid in mice not only improved bone volume and strength but 
also increased muscle mass, and muscle function. Progressive muscle weakness 
coexists with bone disorders, decreasing quality of life and increasing 
morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is a critical need for treatments 
improving muscle mass and function in patients with debilitating weakness. 
Zoledronic acid's benefit extends beyond bone and could also be useful in 
treating muscle weakness associated with bone disorders.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543305

Preprint.","Novel Roles for Diacylglycerol in Synaptic Vesicle Priming and Release Revealed 
by Complete Reconstitution of Core Protein Machinery.","Sundaram RVK, Chatterjee A, Bera M, Grushin K, Panda A, Li F, Coleman J, Lee S, 
Ramakrishnan S, Ernst AM, Gupta K, Rothman JE, Krishnakumar SS.","Here we introduce the full functional reconstitution of genetically-validated 
core protein machinery (SNAREs, Munc13, Munc18, Synaptotagmin, Complexin) for 
synaptic vesicle priming and release in a geometry that enables detailed 
characterization of the fate of docked vesicles both before and after release is 
triggered with Ca 2+ . Using this novel setup, we discover new roles for 
diacylglycerol (DAG) in regulating vesicle priming and Ca 2+- triggered release 
involving the SNARE assembly chaperone Munc13. We find that low concentrations 
of DAG profoundly accelerate the rate of Ca 2+ -dependent release, and high 
concentrations reduce clamping and permit extensive spontaneous release. As 
expected, DAG also increases the number of ready-release vesicles. Dynamic 
single-molecule imaging of Complexin binding to ready-release vesicles directly 
establishes that DAG accelerates the rate of SNAREpin assembly mediated by 
Munc13 and Munc18 chaperones. The selective effects of physiologically validated 
mutations confirmed that the Munc18-Syntaxin-VAMP2 'template' complex is a 
functional intermediate in the production of primed, ready-release vesicles, 
which requires the coordinated action of Munc13 and Munc18.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Munc13 and Munc18 are SNARE-associated chaperones that 
act as ""priming"" factors, facilitating the formation of a pool of docked, 
release-ready vesicles and regulating Ca 2+ -evoked neurotransmitter release. 
Although important insights into Munc18/Munc13 function have been gained, how 
they assemble and operate together remains enigmatic. To address this, we 
developed a novel biochemically-defined fusion assay which enabled us to 
investigate the cooperative action of Munc13 and Munc18 in molecular terms. We 
find that Munc18 nucleates the SNARE complex, while Munc13 promotes and 
accelerates the SNARE assembly in a DAG-dependent manner. The concerted action 
of Munc13 and Munc18 stages the SNARE assembly process to ensure efficient 
'clamping' and formation of stably docked vesicles, which can be triggered to 
fuse rapidly (∼10 msec) upon Ca 2+ influx.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543781

after repetitive ischemia with reperfusion injury.","Quijas MM, Queme LF, Weyler AA, Butterfield A, Joshi DP, Mitxelena-Balerdi I, 
Jankowski MP.","Repetitive ischemia with reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common cause of myalgia. 
I/R injuries occur in many conditions that differentially affect males and 
females including complex regional pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. Our 
preclinical studies have indicated that primary afferent sensitization and 
behavioral hypersensitivity due to I/R may be due to sex specific gene 
expression in the DRGs and distinct upregulation of growth factors and cytokines 
in the affected muscles. In order to determine how these unique gene expression 
programs may be established in a sex dependent manner in a model that more 
closely mimics clinical scenarios, we utilized a newly developed prolonged 
ischemic myalgia model in mice whereby animals experience repeated I/R injuries 
to the forelimb and compared behavioral results to unbiased and targeted 
screening strategies in male and female DRGs. Several distinct proteins were 
found to be differentially expressed in male and female DRGs, including AU-rich 
element RNA binding protein (AUF1), which is known to regulate gene expression. 
Nerve specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of AUF1 inhibited prolonged 
hypersensitivity in females only, while overexpression of AUF1 in male DRG 
neurons increased some pain-like responses. Further, AUF1 knockdown was able to 
specifically inhibit repeated I/R induced gene expression in females but not 
males. Data suggests that RNA binding proteins like AUF1 may underlie the sex 
specific effects on DRG gene expression that modulate behavioral 
hypersensitivity after repeated I/R injury. This study may aid in finding 
distinct receptor differences related to the evolution of acute to chronic 
ischemic muscle pain development between sexes.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544080

Preprint.",Gauge equivariant convolutional neural networks for diffusion mri.,"Hussain U, Khan AR.","Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an imaging technique widely used in neuroimaging 
research, where the signal carries directional information of underlying 
neuronal fibres, based on the diffusivity of water molecules. One of the 
shortcomings of dMRI is that numerous images, sampled at gradient directions on 
a sphere, must be acquired to achieve a reliable angular resolution for 
model-fitting, which translates to longer scan times, higher costs, and barriers 
to clinical adoption. In this work we introduce gauge equivariant convolutional 
neural network (gCNN) layers that overcome the challenges associated with the 
dMRI signal being acquired on a sphere with antipodal points identified, by 
making it equivalent to the real projective plane, R P 2 , which is a 
non-euclidean and a non-orientable manifold. This is in stark contrast to a 
rectangular grid which typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed 
for. We apply our method to upsample angular resolution for predicting diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI) parameters from just six diffusion gradient directions. The 
symmetries introduced allow gCNNs the ability to train with fewer subjects and 
are general enough to be applied to many dMRI related problems.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544263

Preprint.","IL-22 promotes acute kidney injury through activation of the DNA damage response 
and cell death in proximal tubule cells.","Taguchi K, Sugahara S, Elias BC, Pabla N, Canaud G, Brooks CR.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects over 13 million people world-wide annually and 
is associated with a fourfold increase in mortality. Our lab and others have 
shown that DNA damage response (DDR) governs the outcome of AKI in a bimodal 
manner. Activation of DDR sensor kinases protects against AKI, while 
hyperactivation of DDR effector proteins, such as p53, induces to cell death and 
worsens AKI. The factors that trigger the switch from pro-reparative to pro-cell 
death DDR remain to be resolved. Here we investigate the role of interleukin 22 
(IL-22), an IL-10 family member whose receptor (IL-22RA1) is expressed on 
proximal tubule cells (PTCs), in DDR activation and AKI. Using cisplatin and 
aristolochic acid (AA) induced nephropathy as models of DNA damage, we identify 
PTCs as a novel source of urinary IL-22, making PTCs the only epithelial cells 
known to secret IL-22, to our knowledge. Functionally, IL-22 binding its 
receptor (IL-22RA1) on PTCs amplifies the DDR. Treating primary PTCs with IL-22 
alone induces rapid activation of the DDR in vitro . The combination of IL-22 + 
cisplatin or AA treatment on primary PTCs induces cell death, while the same 
dose of cisplatin or AA alone does not. Global deletion of IL-22 protects 
against cisplatin or AA induced AKI. IL-22 deletion reduces expression of 
components of the DDR and inhibits PTC cell death. To confirm PTC IL-22 
signaling contributes to AKI, we knocked out IL-22RA1 in renal epithelial cells 
by crossing IL-22RA1floxed mice with Six2-Cre mice. IL-22RA1 KO reduced DDR 
activation, cell death, and kidney injury. These data demonstrate that IL-22 
promotes DDR activation in PTCs, switching pro-recovery DDR responses to a 
pro-cell death response and worsening AKI. Targeting IL-22 represents a novel 
therapeutic approach to prevent the negative consequences of the DDR activation 
while not interfering with the processes necessary for repair of damaged DNA.
TRANSLATIONAL STATEMENT: Acute kidney injury, which affects 10-20% of 
hospitalized patients, is associated with a fourfold increase in mortality and 
predisposes patients to chronic kidney disease. In the present study, we 
identify interleukin 22 as a cofactor which worsens acute kidney injury. 
Interleukin 22 activates the DNA damage response, which in combination with 
nephrotoxic drugs amplifies the injury response in kidney epithelial cells and 
increases cell death. Deletion of interleukin 22 from mice or its receptor from 
mouse kidneys ameliorates cisplatin induced nephropathy. These findings may help 
clarify the molecular mechanisms of DNA damage induced kidney injury and 
identify interventions that can help treat acute kidney injury.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544134

cells to acute kidney injury.","Creed HA, Kannan S, Tate BL, Banerjee P, Mitchell BM, Chakraborty S, Rutkowski 
JM.","The inflammatory response to acute kidney injury (AKI) likely dictates future 
renal health. Lymphatic vessels are responsible for maintaining tissue 
homeostasis through transport and immunomodulatory roles. Due to the relative 
sparsity of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the kidney, past sequencing 
efforts have not characterized these cells and their response to AKI. Here we 
characterized murine renal LEC subpopulations by single-cell RNA sequencing and 
investigated their changes in cisplatin AKI. We validated our findings by qPCR 
in LECs isolated from both cisplatin-injured and ischemia reperfusion injury, by 
immunofluorescence, and confirmation in in vitro human LECs. We have identified 
renal LECs and their lymphatic vascular roles that have yet to be characterized 
in previous studies. We report unique gene changes mapped across control and 
cisplatin injured conditions. Following AKI, renal LECs alter genes involved 
endothelial cell apoptosis and vasculogenic processes as well as 
immunoregulatory signaling and metabolism. Differences between injury models are 
also identified with renal LECs further demonstrating changed gene expression 
between cisplatin and ischemia reperfusion injury models, indicating the renal 
LEC response is both specific to where they lie in the lymphatic vasculature and 
the renal injury type. How LECs respond to AKI may therefore be key in 
regulating future kidney disease progression.

Preprint.","DNA methylation signatures of early life adversity are exposure-dependent in 
wild baboons.","Anderson JA, Lin D, Lea AJ, Johnston RA, Voyles T, Akinyi MY, Archie EA, Alberts 
SC, Tung J.","The early life environment can profoundly shape the trajectory of an animal's 
life, even years or decades later. One mechanism proposed to contribute to these 
early life effects is DNA methylation. However, the frequency and functional 
importance of DNA methylation in shaping early life effects on adult outcomes is 
poorly understood, especially in natural populations. Here, we integrate 
prospectively collected data on fitness-associated variation in the early 
environment with DNA methylation estimates at 477,270 CpG sites in 256 wild 
baboons. We find highly heterogeneous relationships between the early life 
environment and DNA methylation in adulthood: aspects of the environment linked 
to resource limitation (e.g., low-quality habitat, early life drought) are 
associated with many more CpG sites than other types of environmental stressors 
(e.g., low maternal social status). Sites associated with early resource 
limitation are enriched in gene bodies and putative enhancers, suggesting they 
are functionally relevant. Indeed, by deploying a baboon-specific, massively 
parallel reporter assay, we show that a subset of windows containing these sites 
are capable of regulatory activity, and that, for 88% of early 
drought-associated sites in these regulatory windows, enhancer activity is DNA 
methylation-dependent. Together, our results support the idea that DNA 
methylation patterns contain a persistent signature of the early life 
environment. However, they also indicate that not all environmental exposures 
leave an equivalent mark and suggest that socioenvironmental variation at the 
time of sampling is more likely to be functionally important. Thus, multiple 
mechanisms must converge to explain early life effects on fitness-related 
traits.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The environment animals face when young can affect how 
they function throughout life. Long-lasting changes in DNA methylation-a 
chemical mark deposited on DNA that can affect gene activity-have been 
hypothesized to contribute to early life effects. But evidence for persistent, 
early environment-associated differences in DNA methylation is lacking in wild 
animals. Here, we show that early life adversity in wild baboons predicts DNA 
methylation levels in adulthood, especially for animals born in low resource 
environments and drought conditions. We also show that some of the changes we 
observe in DNA methylation have the capacity to influence gene activity levels. 
Together, our results support the idea that early experiences can become 
biologically embedded in the genomes of wild animals.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.542485

Preprint.",Multistability in neural systems with random cross-connections.,"Breffle J, Mokashe S, Qiu S, Miller P.","Neural circuits with multiple discrete attractor states could support a variety 
of cognitive tasks according to both empirical data and model simulations. We 
assess the conditions for such multistability in neural systems, using a 
firing-rate model framework, in which clusters of neurons with net 
self-excitation are represented as units, which interact with each other through 
random connections. We focus on conditions in which individual units lack 
sufficient self-excitation to become bistable on their own. Rather, 
multistability can arise via recurrent input from other units as a network 
effect for subsets of units, whose net input to each other when active is 
sufficiently positive to maintain such activity. In terms of the strength of 
within-unit self-excitation and standard-deviation of random cross-connections, 
the region of multistability depends on the firing-rate curve of units. Indeed, 
bistability can arise with zero self-excitation, purely through zero-mean random 
cross-connections, if the firing-rate curve rises supralinearly at low inputs 
from a value near zero at zero input. We simulate and analyze finite systems, 
showing that the probability of multistability can peak at intermediate system 
size, and connect with other literature analyzing similar systems in the 
infinite-size limit. We find regions of multistability with a bimodal 
distribution for the number of active units in a stable state. Finally, we find 
evidence for a log-normal distribution of sizes of attractor basins, which can 
appear as Zipf's Law when sampled as the proportion of trials within which 
random initial conditions lead to a particular stable state of the system.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543727

the ALSPAC Birth Cohort.","Papini NM, Bulik CM, Chawner SJ, Micali N.","OBJECTIVE: Pica has been largely understudied in general population samples. 
Pica occurs most often in childhood and appears more prevalent in individuals 
with autism and developmental delays (DD). Pica occurrence in the general 
population is poorly understood due to few epidemiological studies.
METHOD: Data on 10,109 caregivers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents 
and Children (ALSPAC) study who reported pica behavior at 36, 54, 66, 77, and 
115 months on their child were included. Autism was obtained through clinical 
and education records, while DD was derived from the Denver Developmental 
Screening Test.
RESULTS: A total of 312 parents reported pica behaviors in their child. Of 
these, 19.55% reported pica at least at two waves (n=61). Pica was most common 
at 36 months (N=226; 2.29%) and decreased as children aged. A significant 
association was found between pica and autism at all five waves (p < .001). 
There was a significant relationship between pica and DD, with individuals with 
DD more likely to experience pica than those without DD at 36 (p = .01), and 54 
(p < .001), 65 (p=.04), 77 (p <.001), and 115 months (p=.006). Exploratory 
analyses examined pica behaviors with broader eating difficulties and child body 
mass index.
DISCUSSION: Pica is an uncommon behavior in childhood; however, children with DD 
or autism may benefit from pica screening and diagnosis between ages 36-115 
months. Children who exhibit undereating, overeating, and food fussiness may 
also engage in pica behaviors.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.04.23290951

primary and secondary vibrissal somatosensory cortices (vS1 and vS2) interact 
during whisker touch. In the mouse, whisker touch-responsive neurons are 
topographically organized in both vS1 and vS2. Both areas receive thalamic touch

their rarity, these neurons served as the main conduits of touch-evoked activity

unlesioned area, with whisker-specific vS1 lesions degrading whisker-specific 
vS2 touch responses. Thus, a sparse and superficial population of broadly tuned 
touch neurons recurrently amplifies touch responses across vS1 and vS2.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543886

Preprint.","Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi uses two type 3 secretion systems to replicate 
in human macrophages and to colonize humanized mice.","Hamblin M, Schade R, Narasimhan R, Monack DM.","Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi) is a human-restricted pathogen 
that replicates in macrophages. In this study, we investigated the roles of the 
S. Typhi Type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs) encoded on Salmonella Pathogenicity 
Islands (SPI) -1 (T3SS-1) and -2 (T3SS-2) during human macrophage infection. We 
found that mutants of S . Typhi deficient for both T3SSs were defective for 
intramacrophage replication as measured by flow cytometry, viable bacterial 
counts, and live time-lapse microscopy. T3SS-secreted proteins PipB2 and SifA 
contributed to S. Typhi replication and were translocated into the cytosol of 
human macrophages through both T3SS-1 and -2, demonstrating functional 
redundancy for these secretion systems. Importantly, an S . Typhi mutant strain 
that is deficient for both T3SS-1 and -2 was severely attenuated in the ability 
to colonize systemic tissues in a humanized mouse model of typhoid fever. 
Overall, this study establishes a critical role for S. Typhi T3SSs during its 
replication within human macrophages and during systemic infection of humanized 
mice.
IMPORTANCE: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen 
that causes typhoid fever. Understanding the key virulence mechanisms that 
facilitate S. Typhi replication in human phagocytes will enable rational vaccine 
and antibiotic development to limit spread of this pathogen. While S. 
Typhimurium replication in murine models has been studied extensively, there is 
limited information available about S. Typhi replication in human macrophages, 
some of which directly conflicts with findings from S. Typhimurium murine 
models. This study establishes that both of S. Typhi's two Type 3 Secretion 
Systems (T3SS-1 and -2) contribute to intramacrophage replication and virulence.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543980

levels are known to induce intraneuronal Tau pathology ( i.e. 
hyperphosphorylation, oligomerization) in animal models, their role in 
trans-neuronal Tau spreading is unexplored. Here, we find that GCs promote 
secretion of full-length, vesicle-free, phosphorylated Tau from murine 
hippocampal neurons and ex vivo brain slices. This process occurs via type 1 
unconventional protein secretion (UPS) and requires neuronal activity and the 
kinase GSK3β. GCs also dramatically enhance trans-neuronal Tau spreading in vivo 
, and this effect is blocked by an inhibitor of Tau oligomerization and type 1 
UPS. These findings uncover a potential mechanism by which stress/GCs stimulate

point-scanning two-photon microscopy (PSTPM), especially in neuroscience. 
However, due to sequential scanning, PSTPM is slow. With wide-field 
illumination, temporal focusing microscopy (TFM), on the other hand, is much 
faster. However, since a camera detector is used, TFM suffers from the 
scattering of emission photons. So in TFM images fluorescent signals from small

DeScatterNet to de-scatter TFM images. Using a 3D convolutional neural network, 
we build a map from TFM to PSTPM modalities, enabling fast TFM imaging while 
maintaining high image quality through scattering media. We demonstrate this 
approach for in-vivo imaging of dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons in the 
mouse visual cortex. We quantitatively show that our trained network recovers 
biologically relevant features previously buried in the scattered fluorescence 
in the TFM images. In-vivo imaging that combines TFM and the proposed neural

Mbu DL, Naidoo CC, Derendinger B, Walzl G, Malherbe ST, van Helden PD, Semitala 
FC, Yoon C, Gupta RK, Noursadeghi M, Warren RM, Theron G.","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB), a major cause of death in people living with HIV 
(PLHIV), remains challenging to diagnose. Diagnostic accuracy data are lacking 
for promising triage tests, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and confirmatory 
tests, such as sputum and urine Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra), and urine LAM, 
without prior symptom selection.
METHODS: 897 PLHIV initiating antiretroviral therapy were consecutively 
recruited in settings with high TB incidence, irrespective of symptoms. 
Participants were offered sputum induction, with a liquid culture reference 
standard. First, we evaluated point-of-care CRP testing on blood, compared to 
the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended four-symptom screen (W4SS) for 
triage (n=800). Second, we evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) versus Xpert 
MTB/RIF (Xpert) for sputum-based confirmatory testing (n=787), with or without 
sputum induction. Third, we evaluated Ultra and Determine LF-LAM for urine-based 
confirmatory testing (n=732).
FINDINGS: CRP and number of W4SS symptoms had areas under the receiver operator 
characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.73, 0.83) and 0.70 
(0.64, 0.75), respectively. For triage, CRP (≥10 mg/l) has similar sensitivity 
to W4SS [77% (68, 85) vs. 77% (68, 85); p>0.999] but higher specificity [64% 
(61, 68) vs. 48% (45, 52); p<0.001]; reducing unnecessary confirmatory testing 
by 138 per 1000 people and the number-needed-to-test from 6.91 (6.25, 7.81) to 
4.87 (4.41, 5.51). Using sputum, which required induction in 31% (24, 39) of 
people, Ultra had higher sensitivity than Xpert [71% (61, 80) vs. 56% (46, 66); 
p<0.001] but lower specificity [98% (96, 100) vs. 99% (98, 100); p<0.001]. The 
proportion of people with ≥1 positive confirmatory result detected by Ultra 
increased from 45% (26, 64) to 66% (46, 82) when induction was done. 
Programmatically-done haemoglobin, triage test combinations, and urine tests 
showed comparatively worse performance.
INTERPRETATION: Among ART-initiators in a high burden setting, CRP is a more 
specific triage test than W4SS. Sputum induction improves yield. Sputum Ultra is 
a more accurate confirmatory test than Xpert.
FUNDING: SAMRC (MRC-RFA-IFSP-01-2013), EDCTP2 (SF1401, OPTIMAL DIAGNOSIS), 
NIH/NIAD (U01AI152087).
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study: Novel triage and confirmatory 
tests are urgently needed for TB, especially in key risk groups like PLHIV. Many 
TB cases do not meet World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended four-symptom 
screen (W4SS) criteria despite accounting for significant transmission and 
morbidity. W4SS also lacks specificity, which makes onward referral of 
triage-positive people for expensive confirmatory testing inefficient and 
hampers diagnostic scale-up. Alternative triage approaches like CRP have 
promise, but have comparatively little data in ART-initiators, especially when 
done without syndromic preselection and using point-of-care (POC) tools. After 
triage, confirmatory testing can be challenging due to sputum scarcity and 
paucibacillary early-stage disease. Next generation WHO-endorsed rapid molecular 
tests (including Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra; Ultra) are a standard-of-care for 
confirmatory testing. However, there are no supporting data in ART-initiators, 
among whom Ultra may offer large sensitivity gains over predecessors like Xpert 
MTB/RIF (Xpert). The added value of sputum induction to augment diagnostic 
sampling for confirmatory testing is also unclear. Lastly, the performance of 
urine tests (Ultra, Determine LF-LAM) in this population requires more 
data.Added value of this study: We evaluated repurposed and new tests for triage 
and confirmatory testing using a rigorous microbiological reference standard in 
a highly vulnerable high-priority patient population (ART-initiators) regardless 
of symptoms and ability to naturally expectorate sputum. We showed POC CRP 
triage is feasible, performs better than W4SS, and that combinations of 
different triage approaches offer no advantages over CRP alone. Sputum Ultra has 
superior sensitivity to Xpert; often detecting W4SS-negative TB. Furthermore, 
without induction, confirmatory sputum-based testing would not be possible in a 
third of people. Urine tests had poor performance. This study contributed 
unpublished data to systematic reviews and meta-analyses used by the WHO to 
inform global policy supporting use of CRP triage and Ultra in PLHIV.Implication 
of all the available evidence: POC CRP triage testing is feasible and superior 
to W4SS and, together with sputum induction in people who triage CRP-positive 
should, after appropriate cost and implementation research, be considered for 
roll-out in ART-initiators in high burden settings. Such people should be 
offered Ultra, which outperforms Xpert.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.30.23290716

SE, Tilling K, Lawlor DA, Borges MC, Sanderson E.","IMPORTANCE: Observational studies suggest that chronotype is associated with 
pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Whether these associations are causal is 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To explore associations of a lifetime genetic predisposition to an 
evening preference chronotype with pregnancy and perinatal outcomes, and explore 
differences in associations of insomnia and sleep duration with those outcomes 
between chronotype.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization 
(MR) using 105 genetic variants reported in a genome-wide association study 
(N=248 100) to instrument for lifelong predisposition to evening-versus 
morning-preference chronotypes. We generated variant-outcome associations in 
European ancestry women from UK Biobank (UKB, N=176 897), Avon Longitudinal 
Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N=6826), Born in Bradford (BiB, N=2940) 
and Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa, with linked data from 
the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), N=57 430), and extracted equivalent 
associations from FinnGen (N=190 879). We used inverse variance weighted (IVW) 
as main analysis, with weighted median and MR-Egger as sensitivity analyses. We 
also conducted IVW analyses of insomnia and sleep duration on the outcomes 
stratified by genetically predicted chronotype.
EXPOSURES: Self-reported and genetically predicted chronotype, insomnia and 
sleep duration.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Stillbirth, miscarriage, preterm birth, gestational 
diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, perinatal depression, low 
birthweight and macrosomia.
RESULTS: In IVW and sensitivity analyses we did not find robust evidence of 
effects of chronotype on the outcomes. Insomnia was associated with a higher 
risk of preterm birth among evening preference women (odds ratio 1.61, 95% 
confidence interval: 1.17, 2.21), but not among morning preference women (odds 
ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.64, 1.18), with an interaction 
P-value=0.01. There was no evidence of interactions between insomnia and 
chronotype on other outcomes, or between sleep duration and chronotype on any 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study raises the possibility of a higher risk of 
preterm birth among women with insomnia who also have an evening preference 
chronotype. Our findings warrant replications due to imprecision of the 
estimates.
KEY POINTS: Question: Does an evening preference chronotype adversely affect 
pregnancy and perinatal outcomes? Is there an interaction between chronotype and 
either insomnia or sleep duration in relation to those outcomes?Findings: There 
was no evidence that evening preference was associated with pregnancy or 
perinatal outcomes. Women with a genetically predicted insomnia had a higher 
risk of preterm birth, if they also had a genetically predicted preference for 
evening chronotype.Meaning: The suggestive interaction between insomnia and 
evening preference on preterm birth, if replicated, supports targeting insomnia 
prevention in women of reproductive age with an evening chronotype.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.23290898

Preprint.",Punishment resistance for cocaine is associated with inflexible habits in rats.,"Jones BO, Paladino MS, Cruz AM, Spencer HF, Kahanek PL, Scarborough LN, Georges 
SF, Smith RJ.","Addiction is characterized by continued drug use despite negative consequences. 
In an animal model, a subset of rats continues to self-administer cocaine 
despite footshock consequences, showing punishment resistance. We sought to test 
the hypothesis that punishment resistance arises from failure to exert 
goal-directed control over habitual cocaine seeking. While habits are not 
inherently permanent or maladaptive, continued use of habits under conditions 
that should encourage goal-directed control makes them maladaptive and 
inflexible. We trained male and female Sprague Dawley rats on a seeking-taking 
chained schedule of cocaine self-administration (2 h/day). We then exposed them 
to 4 days of punishment testing, in which footshock (0.4 mA, 0.3 s) was 
delivered randomly on one-third of trials, immediately following completion of 
seeking and prior to extension of the taking lever. Before and after punishment 
testing (4 days pre-punishment and ≥4 days post-punishment), we assessed whether 
cocaine seeking was goal-directed or habitual using outcome devaluation via 
cocaine satiety. We found that punishment resistance was associated with 
continued use of habits, whereas punishment sensitivity was associated with 
increased goal-directed control. Although punishment resistance was not 
predicted by habitual responding pre-punishment, it was associated with habitual 
responding post-punishment. In parallel studies of food self-administration, we 
similarly observed that punishment resistance was associated with habitual 
responding post-punishment but not pre-punishment. These findings indicate that 
punishment resistance is related to habits that have become inflexible and 
persist under conditions that should encourage a transition to goal-directed 
behavior.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544242

Preprint.","The Entrainment of the Substantia Nigra During Temporal Lobe Seizures is 
Dependent on the Seizure Onset Pattern.","Connolly MJ, Jiang J, Gutekunst CA, Gross RE, Devergnas A.","RATIONALE: Temporal lobe (TL) epilepsy is the most common form of drug-resistant 
epilepsy. While the limbic circuit and the structures composing the TL have been 
a major focus of human and animal studies on TL seizures, there is also evidence 
suggesting that the basal ganglia have an active role in the propagation and 
control of TL seizures. Studies in patients have shown that TL seizures can 
cause changes in the oscillatory activity of the basal ganglia when the seizures 
spread to extratemporal structures. Preclinical studies have found that 
inhibition of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN), a major output 
structure of the basal ganglia, can reduce the duration and severity of TL 
seizures in animal models. These findings suggest the SN plays a role critical 
in the maintenance or propagation of TL seizures. Two stereotyped onset patterns 
commonly observed in TL seizures are low-amplitude fast (LAF) and high-amplitude 
slow (HAS). Both onset patterns can arise from the same ictogenic circuit, 
however seizures with LAF onset pattern typically spread farther and have a 
larger onset zone than HAS. Therefore, we would expect LAF seizures to entrain 
the SN more so than HAS seizures. Here, we use a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of 
TL seizures to confirm the implication of the SN in TL seizure and to 
characterize the relationship between TL seizure onset pattern and the 
entrainment of the SN.
METHODS: Recording electrodes were implanted in the hippocampus (HPC) and SN in 
2 NHPs. One subject was also implanted with extradural screws for recording 
activity in the somatosensory cortex (SI). Neural activity from both structures 
was recorded at a 2 kHz sampling rate. Seizures were induced by intrahippocampal 
injection of penicillin, which produced multiple spontaneous, nonconvulsive 
seizures over 3-5 hours. The seizure onset patterns were manually classified as 
LAF, HAS or other/undetermined. Across all seizures, spectral power and 
coherence were calculated for the frequency bands 1-7 Hz, 8-12 Hz and 13-25 Hz 
from/between both structures and compared between the 3 seconds before the 
seizure, the first 3 seconds of the seizure, and the 3 seconds before seizure 
offset. These changes were then compared between the LAF and HAS onset patterns.
RESULTS: During temporal lobe seizures, the 8-12 Hz and 13-25 Hz power in the SN 
along with the 1-7 Hz and 13-15 Hz power in the SI was significantly higher 
during onset than before the seizure. Both the SN and SI had an increase in 
coherence with the HPC in the 13-25 Hz and 1- 7 Hz frequency ranges, 
respectively. Comparing these differences between LAF and HAS, both were 
associated with the increase in the HPC/SI coherence, while the increase in 
HPC/SN increase was specific to LAF.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the SN may be entrained by temporal lobe 
seizures secondary to the SI during the farther spreading of LAF seizures, which 
supports the theory that the SN plays a role in the generalization and/or 
maintenance of temporal lobe seizures and helps explains the anti-ictogenic 
effect of SN inhibition.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.04.543608

model of Alzheimer's disease.","Fong V, Kanuri B, Traubert O, Lui M, Patel SB.","The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex and involves an 
imbalance between production and clearance of amyloid-ß peptides (Aß), resulting 
in accumulation of Aß in senile plaques. Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk 
factor for developing AD, with cholesterol shown to accumulate in senile plaques 
and increase production of Aß. ABCG4 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette 
transporters predominantly expressed in the CNS, and has been suggested to play 
a role in cholesterol and Aß efflux from the brain. In this study, we bred Abcg4 
knockout (KO) with the APP Swe,Ind (J9) mouse model of AD to test the hypothesis 
that loss of Abcg4 would exacerbate the AD phenotype. Unexpectedly, no 
differences were observed in Novel object recognition (NOR) and Novel object

for senile plaque numbers. Furthermore, clearance of radiolabeled Aß from the 
brains did not differ between Abcg4 KO and control mice. Metabolic testing by

the microbiomes of individuals living in helminth-endemic regions are

Preprint.",Gender-based heterogeneity of FAHFAs in trained runners.,"Nelson AB, Chow LS, Dengel DR, Pan M, Hughey CC, Han X, Puchalska P, Crawford 
PA.","Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) are anti-diabetic and 
anti-inflammatory lipokines. Recently FAHFAs were also found to predict 
cardiorespiratory fitness in trained runners. Here we compared the association 
between circulating FAHFA baseline concentrations and body composition, 
determined by dual x-ray absorptiometry, in female runners who were lean (BMI < 
25 kg/m 2 , n = 6), to those who were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 , n = 7). We 
also compared circulating FAHFAs in lean male runners (n = 8) to the same 
trained lean female (n = 6) runner group. Circulating FAHFAs were increased in 
females in a manner that was modulated by specific adipose depot sizes, blood 
glucose, and lean body mass. As expected, circulating FAHFAs were diminished in 
the overweight group, but, strikingly, in both lean and overweight cohorts, 
increases in circulating FAHFAs were promoted by increased fat mass, relative to 
lean mass. These studies suggest multimodal regulation of circulating FAHFAs and 
raise hypotheses to test endogenous FAHFA dynamic sources and sinks in health 
and disease, which will be essential for therapeutic target development.

hampered in part by the lack of suitable animal models. Here we used 
ACE2-transgenic mice recovered from Omicron (BA.1) infection to test for 
pulmonary and behavioral post-acute sequelae. Through in-depth phenotyping by 
CyTOF, we demonstrate that naïve mice experiencing a first Omicron infection 
exhibit profound immune perturbations in the lung after resolving acute 
infection. This is not observed if mice were first vaccinated with 
spike-encoding mRNA. The protective effects of vaccination against post-acute 
sequelae were associated with a highly polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell 
response that was recalled upon BA.1 breakthrough infection but not seen with 
BA.1 infection alone. Without vaccination, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 was 
uniquely upregulated on multiple pulmonary immune subsets in the BA.1 
convalescent mice, a process previously connected to severe COVID-19. Taking 
advantage of recent developments in AI-based assessments of murine behaviors, we 
demonstrate that BA.1 convalescent mice respond abnormally to a stimulus after

Preprint.","Effects of sex and estrous cycle on intravenous oxycodone self-administration 
and the reinstatement of oxycodone-seeking behavior in rats.","Hinds NM, Wojtas ID, Gallagher CA, Corbett CM, Manvich DF.","The increasing misuse of both prescription and illicit opioids has culminated in 
a national healthcare crisis in the United States. Oxycodone is among the most 
widely prescribed and misused opioid pain relievers and has been associated with 
a high risk for transition to compulsive opioid use. Here, we sought to examine 
potential sex differences and estrous cycle-dependent effects on the reinforcing 
efficacy of oxycodone, as well as on stress-induced or cue-induced 
oxycodone-seeking behavior, using intravenous (IV) oxycodone self-administration 
and reinstatement procedures. In experiment 1, adult male and female Long-Evans 
rats were trained to self-administer 0.03 mg/kg/inf oxycodone according to a 
fixed-ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement in daily 2-hr sessions, and a 
dose-response function was subsequently determined (0.003-0.03 mg/kg/inf). In 
experiment 2, a separate group of adult male and female Long-Evans rats were 
trained to self-administer 0.03 mg/kg/inf oxycodone for 8 sessions, followed by 
0.01 mg/kg/inf oxycodone for 10 sessions. Responding was then extinguished, 
followed by sequential footshock-induced and cue-induced reinstatement tests. In 
the dose-response experiment, oxycodone produced a typical inverted U-shape 
function with 0.01 mg/kg/inf representing the maximally effective dose in both 
sexes. No sex differences were detected in the reinforcing efficacy of 
oxycodone. In the second experiment, the reinforcing effects of 0.01-0.03 
mg//kg/inf oxycodone were significantly attenuated in females during 
proestrus/estrus as compared to metestrus/diestrus phases of the estrous cycle. 
Neither males nor females displayed significant footshock-induced reinstatement 
of oxycodone seeking, but both sexes exhibited significant cue-induced 
reinstatement of oxycodone seeking at magnitudes that did not differ either by 
sex or by estrous cycle phase. These results confirm and extend previous work 
suggesting that sex does not robustly influence the primary reinforcing effects 
of oxycodone nor the reinstatement of oxycodone-seeking behavior. However, our 
findings reveal for the first time that the reinforcing efficacy of IV oxycodone 
varies across the estrous cycle in female rats.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543393

Differences between IVV, IVC and IVR embryos were mainly contributed by ICM and

of these non-TE cells between groups pointed to highly active metabolic and 
biosynthetic processes, with reduced cellular signaling and membrane transport 
in IVC embryos, which may lead to reduced developmental potential. IVR embryos 
had lower activities in metabolic and biosynthetic processes, but increased 
cellular signaling and membrane transport, suggesting these cellular mechanisms 
may contribute to the improved blastocyst development compared to IVC embryos. 
However, the IVR embryos had compromised development when compared to IVV 
embryos with notably over-active membrane transport activities that led to 
impaired ion homeostasis.

the Caenorhabditis elegans cuticle.","Birnbaum SK, Cohen JD, Belfi A, Murray JI, Adams JRG, Chisholm AD, Sundaram MV.","Some types of collagens, including transmembrane MACIT collagens and C. elegans 
cuticle collagens, are N-terminally cleaved at a dibasic site that resembles the 
consensus for furin or other proprotein convertases of the subtilisin/kexin 
(PCSK) family. Such cleavage may release transmembrane collagens from the plasma 
membrane and affect extracellular matrix assembly or structure. However, the 
functional consequences of such cleavage are unclear and evidence for the role 
of specific PCSKs is lacking. Here, we used endogenous collagen fusions to 
fluorescent proteins to visualize the secretion and assembly of the first 
collagen-based cuticle in C. elegans and then tested the role of the PCSK BLI-4 
in these processes. Unexpectedly, we found that cuticle collagens SQT-3 and 
DPY-17 are secreted into the extraembryonic space several hours before cuticle 
matrix assembly. Furthermore, this early secretion depends on BLI-4/PCSK; in 
bli-4 and cleavage-site mutants, SQT-3 and DPY-17 are not efficiently secreted 
and instead form large intracellular aggregates. Their later assembly into 
cuticle matrix is reduced but not entirely blocked. These data reveal a role for 
collagen N-terminal processing in intracellular trafficking and in the spatial 
and temporal restriction of matrix assembly in vivo . Our observations also 
prompt a revision of the classic model for C. elegans cuticle matrix assembly

across gestation. Understanding differences in ongoing pregnancies are essential 
to identify the role of chorionic villi at specific times in gestation and 
develop biomarkers and prognostic indicators of maternal- fetal health.
METHODS: The normative mRNA profile is established using next-generation 
sequencing of 124 first trimester and 43 third trimester human placentas from 
ongoing healthy pregnancies. Stably expressed genes not different between 
trimesters and with low variability are identified. Differential expression 
analysis of first versus third trimester adjusted for fetal sex is performed, 
followed by a subanalysis with 23 matched pregnancies to control for subject 
variability using the same genetic and environmental background.
RESULTS: Placenta expresses 14,979 mRNAs above sequencing noise (TPM>0.66), with 
1,545 stably expressed genes across gestation. Differentially expressed genes 
account for 86.7% of genes in the full cohort (FDR<0.05). Fold changes highly 
correlate between the full cohort and subanalysis (Pearson = 0.98). At stricter 
thresholds (FDR<0.001, fold change>1.5), there are 6,941 differentially 
expressed protein coding genes (3,206 upregulated in first and 3,735 upregulated 
in third trimester).
CONCLUSION: This is the largest mRNA atlas of healthy human placenta across 
gestation, controlling for genetic and environmental factors, demonstrating 
substantial changes from first to third trimester in chorionic villi. Specific 
differences and stably expressed genes may be used to understand the specific 
role of the chorionic villi throughout gestation and develop first trimester 
biomarkers of placental health that transpire across gestation, which can be 
used for future development of biomarkers in maternal-fetal disease.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543972

context-dependent function. Our aim is to define the contribution of eosinophils 
in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), since their role in ESCC is 
unknown.
METHODS: Eosinophils were enumerated in tissues from two ESCC cohorts. Mice were 
treated with 4-nitroquinolone-1-oxide (4-NQO) for 8 weeks to induce pre-cancer 
or 16 weeks to induce carcinoma. Eosinophil number was modified by monoclonal 
antibody to IL-5 (IL5mAb), recombinant IL-5 (rIL-5), or genetically with 
eosinophil-deficient (ΔdblGATA) mice or mice deficient in eosinophil 
chemoattractant eotaxin-1 ( Ccl11 -/- ). Esophageal tissue and eosinophil 
specific RNA-sequencing was performed to understand eosinophil function. 3-D 
co-culturing of eosinophils with pre-cancer or cancer cells was done to 
ascertain direct effects of eosinophils.
RESULTS: Activated eosinophils are present in higher numbers in early stage 
versus late stage ESCC. Mice treated with 4-NQO exhibit more esophageal 
eosinophils in pre-cancer versus cancer. Correspondingly, epithelial cell Ccl11 
expression is higher in mice with pre-cancer. Eosinophil depletion using three 
mouse models ( Ccl11 -/- mice, ΔdblGATA mice, IL5mAb treatment) all display 
exacerbated 4-NQO tumorigenesis. Conversely, treatment with rIL-5 increases 
esophageal eosinophilia and protects against pre-cancer and carcinoma. Tissue 
and eosinophil RNA-sequencing revealed eosinophils drive oxidative stress in 
pre-cancer. In vitro co-culturing of eosinophils with pre-cancer or cancer cells 
resulted in increased apoptosis in the presence of a degranulating agent, which 
is reversed with N-acetylcysteine, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. 
ΔdblGATA mice exhibited increased CD4 T cell infiltration, IL-17, and enrichment 
of IL-17 pro-tumorigenic pathways.
CONCLUSION: Eosinophils likely protect against ESCC through ROS release during 
degranulation and suppression of IL-17.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543287

Enhancer mRNA.","Whittaker A, Goss DJ.","Cap-independent translation initiation in eukaryotes involves initiation factor 
(eIF) binding to a transcript's 5' untranslated region (UTR). 
Internal-ribosome-entry-site (IRES)-like cap-independent translation initiation 
does not require a free 5' end for eIF binding, as eIFs recruit the ribosome to 
or near the start codon. For viral mRNA, recruitment usually utilizes RNA 
structure, such as a pseudoknot. However, for cellular mRNA cap-independent 
translation, no consensus RNA structures or sequences have yet been identified 
for eIF binding. Fibroblast-growth factor 9 (FGF-9) is a member of a subset of 
mRNA that are cap-independently upregulated in breast and colorectal cancer 
cells using this IRES-like method. Death-associated factor 5 (DAP5), an eIF4GI 
homolog, binds directly to the FGF-9 5' UTR to initiate translation. However, 
the DAP5 binding site within the FGF-9 5' UTR is unknown. Moreover, DAP5 binds 
to other, dissimilar 5' UTRs, some of which need a free 5' end to stimulate 
cap-independent translation. We propose that a particular RNA structure 
involving tertiary folding, rather than a conserved sequence or secondary 
structure, acts as a DAP5 binding site. Using SHAPE-seq, we modeled the FGF-9 5' 
UTR RNA's complex secondary and tertiary structure in vitro. Further, DAP5 
footprinting and toeprinting experiments show DAP5's preference for one face of 
this structure. DAP5 binding appears to stabilize a higher-energy RNA fold that 
frees the 5' end to solvent and brings the start codon close to the recruited 
ribosome. Our findings offer a fresh perspective in the hunt for cap-independent 
translational enhancers. Structural, rather than sequence-specific, eIF binding 
sites may act as attractive chemotherapeutic targets or as dosage tools for 
mRNA-based therapies.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.542187

understanding RNA regulation by assigning proteins, particularly RBPs, to 
specific RNA substrates, there has been considerably less exploration leveraging 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) methodologies to identify and study the role 
of proteins in mRNA life-cycle stages. To address this gap, we generated an 
RNA-aware RBP-centric PPI map across the mRNA life-cycle by immunopurification 
(IP-MS) of ∼100 endogenous RBPs across the life-cycle in the presence or absence 
of RNase, augmented by size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MS). Aside from 
confirming 8,700 known and discovering 20,359 novel interactions between 1125 
proteins, we determined that 73% of our IP interactions are regulated by the 
presence of RNA. Our PPI data enables us to link proteins to life-cycle stage 
functions, highlighting that nearly half of the proteins participate in at least 
two distinct stages. We show that one of the most highly interconnected 
proteins, ERH, engages in multiple RNA processes, including via interactions 
with nuclear speckles and the mRNA export machinery. We also demonstrate that 
the spliceosomal protein SNRNP200 participates in distinct stress 
granule-associated RNPs and occupies different RNA target regions in the 
cytoplasm during stress. Our comprehensive RBP-focused PPI network is a novel

dissection of pathways contributing to CRCI and pharmacologic screens to

Preprint.","Asymmetric distribution of color-opponent response types across mouse visual 
cortex supports superior color vision in the sky.","Franke K, Cai C, Ponder K, Fu J, Sokoloski S, Berens P, Tolias AS.","Color is an important visual feature that informs behavior, and the retinal 
basis for color vision has been studied across various vertebrate species. While 
we know how color information is processed in visual brain areas of primates, we 
have limited understanding of how it is organized beyond the retina in other 
species, including most dichromatic mammals. In this study, we systematically 
characterized how color is represented in the primary visual cortex (V1) of 
mice. Using large-scale neuronal recordings and a luminance and color noise 
stimulus, we found that more than a third of neurons in mouse V1 are 
color-opponent in their receptive field center, while the receptive field 
surround predominantly captures luminance contrast. Furthermore, we found that 
color-opponency is especially pronounced in posterior V1 that encodes the sky, 
matching the statistics of mouse natural scenes. Using unsupervised clustering, 
we demonstrate that the asymmetry in color representations across cortex can be 
explained by an uneven distribution of green-On/UV-Off color-opponent response 
types that are represented in the upper visual field. This type of 
coloropponency in the receptive field center was not present at the level of the 
retinal output and, therefore, is likely computed in the cortex by integrating 
upstream visual signals. Finally, a simple model with natural scene-inspired 
parametric stimuli shows that green-On/UV-Off color-opponent response types may 
enhance the detection of ""predatory""-like dark UV-objects in noisy daylight 
scenes. The results from this study highlight the relevance of color processing 
in the mouse visual system and contribute to our understanding of how color 
information is organized in the visual hierarchy across species. More broadly, 
they support the hypothesis that visual cortex combines upstream information 
towards computing neuronal selectivity to behaviorally-relevant sensory 
features.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543054

Preprint.","Electric field stimulation unmasks a subtle role for T-type calcium channels in 
regulating lymphatic contraction.","Davis MJ, Castorena-Gonzalez JA, Zawieja SD.","We previously identified two isoforms of T-type, voltage-gated calcium (Ca v 3) 
channels (Ca v 3.1, Ca v 3.2) that are functionally expressed in murine 
lymphatic muscle cells; however, contractile tests of lymphatic vessels from 
single and double Ca v 3 knock-out (DKO) mice, exhibited nearly identical 
parameters of spontaneous twitch contractions as wild-type (WT) vessels, 
suggesting that Ca v 3 channels play no significant role. Here, we considered 
the possibility that the contribution of Ca v 3 channels might be too subtle to 
detect in standard contraction analyses. We compared the sensitivity of 
lymphatic vessels from WT and Ca v 3 DKO mice to the L-type calcium channel (Ca 
v 1.2) inhibitor nifedipine and found that the latter vessels were significantly 
more sensitive to inhibition, suggesting that the contribution of Ca v 3 
channels might normally be masked by Ca v 1.2 channel activity. We hypothesized 
that shifting the resting membrane potential (Vm) of lymphatic muscle to a more 
negative voltage might enhance the contribution of Ca v 3 channels. Because even 
slight hyperpolarization is known to completely silence spontaneous 
contractions, we devised a method to evoke nerve-independent, twitch 
contractions from mouse lymphatic vessels using single, short pulses of electric 
field stimulation (EFS). TTX was present throughout to block the potential 
contributions of voltage-gated Na + channels in perivascular nerves and 
lymphatic muscle. In WT vessels, EFS evoked single contractions that were 
comparable in amplitude and degree of entrainment to those occurring 
spontaneously. When Ca v 1.2 channels were blocked or deleted, only small 
residual EFS-evoked contractions (~ 5% of normal amplitude) were present. These 
residual, EFS-evoked contractions were enhanced (to 10-15%) by the K ATP channel 
activator pinacidil (PIN) but were absent in Ca v 3 DKO vessels. Our results 
point to a subtle contribution of Ca v 3 channels to lymphatic contractions that 
can be unmasked in the absence of Ca v 1.2 channel activity and when the resting 
Vm is more hyperpolarized than normal.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2938440/v1

C-Dependent Cardiac Hypertrophic Signaling.","Wei W, Smrcka AV.","Chronically elevated neurohumoral drive, and particularly elevated adrenergic 
tone leading to β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) overstimulation in cardiac 
myocytes, is a key mechanism involved in the progression of heart failure. β1-AR 
and β2-ARs are the two major subtypes of β-ARs present in the human heart, 
however, they elicit different or even opposite effects on cardiac function and 
hypertrophy. For example, chronic activation of β1ARs drives detrimental cardiac 
remodeling while β2AR signaling is protective. The underlying molecular 
mechanisms for cardiac protection through β2ARs remain unclear. Here we show 
that β2-AR protects against hypertrophy through inhibition of PLCε signaling at 
the Golgi apparatus. The mechanism for β2AR-mediated PLC inhibition requires 
internalization of β2AR, activation of Gi and Gβγ subunit signaling at endosomes 
and ERK activation. This pathway inhibits both angiotensin II and 
Golgi-β1-AR-mediated stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis at the Golgi 
apparatus ultimately resulting in decreased PKD and HDAC5 phosphorylation and 
protection against cardiac hypertrophy. This reveals a mechanism for β2-AR 
antagonism of the PLCε pathway that may contribute to the known protective 
effects of β2-AR signaling on the development of heart failure.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544153

Preprint.","α-synuclein promotes neuronal dysfunction and death by disrupting the binding of 
ankyrin to ß-spectrin.","Maor G, Dubreuil RR, Feany MB.","α-synuclein plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and 
related disorders, but critical interacting partners and molecular mechanisms 
mediating neurotoxicity are incompletely understood. We show that α-synuclein 
binds directly to ß-spectrin. Using males and females in a Drosophila model of 
α-synuclein-related disorders we demonstrate that ß-spectrin is critical for 
α-synuclein neurotoxicity. Further, the ankyrin binding domain of ß-spectrin is 
required for α-synuclein binding and neurotoxicity. A key plasma membrane target 
of ankyrin, Na + /K + ATPase, is mislocalized when human α-synuclein is 
expressed in Drosophila . Accordingly, membrane potential is depolarized in 
α-synuclein transgenic fly brains. We examine the same pathway in human neurons 
and find that Parkinson's disease patient-derived neurons with a triplication of 
the α-synuclein locus show disruption of the spectrin cytoskeleton, 
mislocalization of ankyrin and Na + /K + ATPase, and membrane potential 
depolarization. Our findings define a specific molecular mechanism by which 
elevated levels of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and related 
α-synucleinopathies leads to neuronal dysfunction and death.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The small synaptic vesicle associate protein α-synuclein 
plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related 
disorders, but the disease-relevant binding partners of α-synuclein and 
proximate pathways critical for neurotoxicity require further definition. We 
show that α-synuclein binds directly to ß-spectrin, a key cytoskeletal protein 
required for localization of plasma membrane proteins and maintenance of 
neuronal viability. Binding of α-synuclein to ß-spectrin alters the organization 
of the spectrin-ankyrin complex, which is critical for localization and function 
of integral membrane proteins, including Na + /K + ATPase. These finding outline 
a previously undescribed mechanism of α-synuclein neurotoxicity and thus suggest 
potential new therapeutic approaches in Parkinson's disease and related

the United States during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Bayly H, Stoddard M, Egeren DV, Murray EJ, Raifman J, Chakravarty A, White LF.","Contact tracing forms a crucial part of the public-health toolbox in mitigating 
and understanding emergent pathogens and nascent disease outbreaks. Contact 
tracing in the United States was conducted during the pre-Omicron phase of the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This tracing relied on voluntary reporting and 
responses, often using rapid antigen tests (with a high false negative rate) due 
to lack of accessibility to PCR tests. These limitations, combined with 
SARS-CoV-2's propensity for asymptomatic transmission, raise the question ""how 
reliable was contact tracing for COVID-19 in the United States""? We answered 
this question using a Markov model to examine the efficiency with which 
transmission could be detected based on the design and response rates of contact 
tracing studies in the United States. Our results suggest that contact tracing 
protocols in the U.S. are unlikely to have identified more than 1.65% (95% 
uncertainty interval: 1.62%-1.68%) of transmission events with PCR testing and 
0.88% (95% uncertainty interval 0.86%-0.89%) with rapid antigen testing. When 
considering an optimal scenario, based on compliance rates in East Asia with PCR 
testing, this increases to 62.7% (95% uncertainty interval: 62.6%-62.8%). These 
findings highlight the limitations in interpretability for studies of SARS-CoV-2 
disease spread based on U.S. contact tracing and underscore the vulnerability of

Preprint.","Strain-dependent effects on neurobehavioral and seizure phenotypes in Scn2a 
(K1422E) mice.","Echevarria-Cooper DM, Hawkins NA, Kearney JA.","Pathogenic variants in SCN2A are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental 
disorders (NDD). Despite being largely monogenic, SCN2A -related NDD show 
considerable phenotypic variation and complex genotype-phenotype correlations. 
Genetic modifiers can contribute to variability in disease phenotypes associated 
with rare driver mutations. Accordingly, different genetic backgrounds across 
inbred rodent strains have been shown to influence disease-related phenotypes, 
including those associated with SCN2A -related NDD. Recently, we developed a 
mouse model of the variant SCN2A -p.K1422E that was maintained as an isogenic 
line on the C57BL/6J (B6) strain. Our initial characterization of NDD phenotypes 
in heterozygous Scn2a K1422E mice revealed alterations in anxiety-related 
behavior and seizure susceptibility. To determine if background strain affects 
phenotype severity in the Scn2a K1422E mouse model, phenotypes of mice on B6 and 
[DBA/2JxB6]F1 hybrid (F1D2) strains were compared. Convergent evidence from 
neurobehavioral assays demonstrated lower anxiety-like behavior in Scn2a K1422E 
mice compared to wild-type and further suggested that this effect is more 
pronounced on the B6 background compared to the F1D2 background. Although there 
were no strain-dependent differences in occurrence of rare spontaneous seizures, 
response to the chemoconvulsant kainic acid revealed differences in seizure 
generalization and lethality risk, with variation based on strain and sex. 
Continued examination of strain-dependent effects in the Scn2a K1422E mouse 
model could reveal genetic backgrounds with unique susceptibility profiles that 
would be relevant for future studies on specific traits and enable the 
identification of highly penetrant phenotypes and modifier genes that could 
provide clues about the primary pathogenic mechanism of the K1422E variant.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543929

lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9ALS/FTD), while a CGG 
trinucleotide repeat expansion in FMR1 leads to the neurodegenerative disorder 
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). These GC-rich repeats form 
RNA secondary structures that support repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) 
translation of toxic proteins that contribute to disease pathogenesis. Here we 
assessed whether these same repeats might trigger stalling and interfere with 
translational elongation. We find that depletion of ribosome-associated quality 
control (RQC) factors NEMF, LTN1, and ANKZF1 markedly boost RAN translation 
product accumulation from both G4C2 and CGG repeats while overexpression of 
these factors reduces RAN production in both reporter cell lines and C9ALS/FTD 
patient iPSC-derived neurons. We also detected partially made products from both 
G4C2 and CGG repeats whose abundance increased with RQC factor depletion. Repeat 
RNA sequence, rather than amino acid content, is central to the impact of RQC 
factor depletion on RAN translation - suggesting a role for RNA secondary 
structure in these processes. Together, these findings suggest that ribosomal 
stalling and RQC pathway activation during RAN translation elongation inhibits 
the generation of toxic RAN products. We propose augmenting RQC activity as a 
therapeutic strategy in GC-rich repeat expansion disorders.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544135

Subramanyam V, Gilbert LA, Goodarzi H, Li L.","ENPP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in many cancers, and we 
previously discovered that ENPP1 is the dominant hydrolase of extracellular 
cGAMP: a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter that activates the anticancer 
STING pathway. However, ENPP1 has other catalytic activities and the molecular 
and cellular mechanisms contributing to its tumorigenic effects remain unclear. 
Here, using single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), we show that ENPP1 overexpression 
drives primary breast tumor growth and metastasis by synergistically dampening 
extracellular cGAMP-STING mediated antitumoral immunity and activating 
immunosuppressive extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling. In addition to 
cancer cells, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) also 
express ENPP1 that restrains their response to tumor-derived cGAMP. Enpp1 
loss-of-function in both cancer cells and normal tissues slowed primary tumor 
initiation and growth and prevented metastasis in an extracellular cGAMP- and 
STING-dependent manner. Selectively abolishing the cGAMP hydrolysis activity of 
ENPP1 phenocopied total ENPP1 knockout, demonstrating that restoration of 
paracrine cGAMP-STING signaling is the dominant anti-cancer mechanism of ENPP1 
inhibition. Strikingly, we find that breast cancer patients with low ENPP1 
expression have significantly higher immune infiltration and improved response 
to therapeutics impacting cancer immunity upstream or downstream of the 
cGAMP-STING pathway, like PARP inhibitors and anti-PD1. Altogether, selective 
inhibition of ENPP1's cGAMP hydrolase activity alleviates an innate immune 
checkpoint to boost cancer immunity and is therefore a promising therapeutic 
approach against breast cancer that may synergize with other cancer 
immunotherapies.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543353

MA, Weaver A, Sekar S, Liu C.","OBJECTIVES: To compare how junior clinical researchers generate data-driven 
hypotheses with a visual interactive analytic tool for filtering and summarizing 
large health data sets coded with hierarchical terminologies (VIADS) or other 
analytical tools routinely used by participants on the same datasets.
METHODS: We recruited clinical researchers from all over the United States of 
America and separated them into ""experienced"" and ""inexperienced"" groups using 
predetermined criteria. Within the groups, participants were randomly assigned 
to a VIADS or non-VIADS groups (control) group. We recruited two participants 
for the pilot study and 18 for the main study. Fifteen (out of 18) were junior 
clinical researchers, including seven in the control group and eight in the 
VIADS group. All participants used the same datasets and study scripts. Each 
participant conducted a remote 2-hour study session for hypothesis generation. 
The VIADS groups also had a 1-hour training session. The same researcher 
coordinated the study session. Two participants in the pilot study were one 
experienced and one inexperienced clinical researcher. During the session, all 
participants followed a think-aloud protocol to verbalize their thoughts and 
actions during data analysis and hypothesis generation. Follow-up surveys were 
administered to all participants after each study session. All screen activities 
and audio were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed. Every ten randomly 
selected hypotheses were included in one Qualtrics survey for quality 
evaluation. Seven expert panel members rated each hypothesis on validity, 
significance, and feasibility.
RESULTS: Eighteen participants generated 227 hypotheses, of which 147 (65%) were 
valid based on our criteria. Each participant generated between one and 19 valid 
hypotheses during the 2-hour session. The VIADS and control groups generated a 
similar number of hypotheses on average. It took the VIADS group participants 
approximately 258 seconds to generate one valid hypothesis; for the control 
group- it took 379 seconds; however, the difference was not statistically 
significant. Furthermore, the validity and significance of the hypotheses were 
slightly lower in the VIADS group, though not statistically significant. The 
feasibility of the hypotheses was statistically significantly lower in the VIADS 
group than in the control group. The average quality rating of hypotheses per 
participant ranged from 7.04 to 10.55 (out of 15). In the follow-up surveys, 
VIADS users provided overwhelmingly positive feedback on VIADS, and they all 
agreed (100%) that VIADS offered new perspectives on the datasets.
CONCLUSION: The role of VIADS in hypothesis generation trended favorably with 
respect to the assessment of hypotheses generated; however, a statistically 
significant difference was not reached, possibly related to sample size or the 
2-hour study session being inadequate. Further characterization of hypotheses, 
including specifics on how they might be improved, could guide future tool 
development. Larger-scale studies may help to reveal more conclusive hypothesis 
generation mechanisms.

Pina-Oviedo S, Juvvadi PR, Steinbach WJ, Ciofani M, Hong J, Heitman J.","Fungal infections are of mounting global concern, and the current limited 
treatment arsenal poses challenges when treating such infections. In particular, 
infections by Cryptococcus neoformans are associated with high mortality, 
emphasizing the need for novel therapeutic options. Calcineurin is a protein 
phosphatase that mediates fungal stress responses, and calcineurin inhibition by 
the natural product FK506 blocks C. neoformans growth at 37°C. Calcineurin is 
also required for pathogenesis. However, because calcineurin is conserved in 
humans, and inhibition with FK506 results in immunosuppression, the use of FK506 
as an anti-infective agent is precluded. We previously elucidated the structures 
of multiple fungal calcineurin-FK506-FKBP12 complexes and implicated the C-22 
position on FK506 as a key point for differential modification of ligand 
inhibition of the mammalian versus fungal target proteins. Through in vitro 
antifungal and immunosuppressive testing of analogs of FK520 (natural analog of 
FK506) analogs, we identified JH-FK-08 as a lead candidate for further 
antifungal development. JH-FK-08 exhibited significantly reduced 
immunosuppressive activity and both reduced fungal burden and prolonged survival 
of infected animals. JH-FK-08 exhibited additive activity in combination with 
fluconazole in vivo . These findings further advance calcineurin inhibition as 
an antifungal therapeutic approach.
IMPORTANCE: Fungal infections cause significant morbidity and mortality 
globally. The therapeutic armamentarium against these infections is limited and 
development of antifungal drugs has been hindered by the evolutionary 
conservation between fungi and the human host. With rising resistance to the 
current antifungal arsenal and an increasing at-risk population, there is an 
urgent need for the development of new antifungal compounds. The FK520 analogs 
described in this study display potent antifungal activity as a novel class of 
antifungals centered on modifying an existing orally-active FDA approved 
therapy. This research advances the development of much needed newer antifungal 
treatment options with novel mechanisms of action.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543712

thrombosis in arteries with a two-phase continuum model. The model explicitly 
tracks the formation and rupture of the two types of interplatelet bonds, the 
rates of which are coupled with the local flow conditions. The motion of 
platelets in the thrombi results from competition between the viscoelastic 
forces generated by the interplatelet bonds and the fluid drag. Our simulation 
results indicate that stable occlusive thrombi form only under specific 
combinations for the ranges of model parameters such as rates of bond formation

Preprint.","PRFect: A tool to predict programmed ribosomal frameshifts in prokaryotic and 
viral genomes.","McNair K, Salamon P, Edwards RA, Segall AM.","Background One of the stranger phenomena that can occur during gene translation 
is where, as a ribosome reads along the mRNA, various cellular and molecular 
properties contribute to stalling the ribosome on a slippery sequence, shifting 
the ribosome into one of the other two alternate reading frames. The alternate 
frame has different codons, so different amino acids are added to the peptide 
chain, but more importantly, the original stop codon is no longer in-frame, so 
the ribosome can bypass the stop codon and continue to translate the codons past 
it. This produces a longer version of the protein, a fusion of the original 
in-frame amino acids, followed by all the alternate frame amino acids. There is 
currently no automated software to predict the occurrence of these programmed 
ribosomal frameshifts (PRF), and they are currently only identified by manual 
curation. Results Here we present PRFect, an innovative machine-learning method 
for the detection and prediction of PRFs in coding genes of various types. 
PRFect combines advanced machine learning techniques with the integration of 
multiple complex cellular properties, such as secondary structure, codon usage, 
ribosomal binding site interference, direction, and slippery site motif. 
Calculating and incorporating these diverse properties posed significant 
challenges, but through extensive research and development, we have achieved a 
user-friendly approach. The code for PRFect is freely available, open-source, 
and can be easily installed via a single command in the terminal. Our 
comprehensive evaluations on diverse organisms, including bacteria, archaea, and 
phages, demonstrate PRFect's strong performance, achieving high sensitivity, 
specificity, and an accuracy exceeding 90%. Conclusion PRFect represents a 
significant advancement in the field of PRF detection and prediction, offering a 
powerful tool for researchers and scientists to unravel the intricacies of 
programmed ribosomal frameshifting in coding genes.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2997217/v1

contribute markedly to the negative aspects of the disorder. Here, we identify 
the mechanisms that underlie hypersensitivity in a sensorimotor reflex found to 
be altered in humans and in mice with loss-of-function in the ASD risk-factor 
gene SCN2A . The cerebellum-dependent vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which helps 
maintain one's gaze during movement, was hypersensitized due to deficits in 
cerebellar synaptic plasticity. Heterozygous loss of SCN2A -encoded Na V 1.2 
sodium channels in granule cells impaired high-frequency transmission to 
Purkinje cells and long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity 
important for modulating VOR gain. VOR plasticity could be rescued in adolescent 
mice via a CRISPR-activator approach that increases Scn2a expression, 
highlighting how evaluation of simple reflexes can be used as quantitative 
readout of therapeutic interventions.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543814

development of uterine fibroids (UFs) in women. UFs, non-cancerous tumors, are 
thought to originate from abnormal myometrial stem cells (MMSCs). Defective DNA 
repair capacity may contribute to the emergence of mutations that promote tumor 
growth. The multifunctional cytokine TGFβ1 is associated with UF progression and 
DNA damage repair pathways. To investigate the impact of EDC exposure on TGFβ1 
and nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways, we isolated MMSCs from 5-months 
old Eker rats exposed neonatally to Diethylstilbestrol (DES), an EDC, or to 
vehicle (VEH). EDC-MMSCs exhibited overactivated TGFβ1 signaling and reduced 
mRNA and protein levels of NER pathway components compared to VEH-MMSCs. 
EDC-MMSCs also demonstrated impaired NER capacity. Exposing VEH-MMSCs to TGFβ1 
decreased NER capacity while inhibiting TGFβ signaling in EDC-MMSCs restored it. 
RNA-seq analysis and further validation revealed decreased expression of Uvrag, 
a tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA damage recognition, in VEH-MMSCs treated 
with TGFβ1, but increased expression in EDC-MMSCs after TGFβ signaling 
inhibition. Overall, we demonstrated that the overactivation of the TGFβ pathway 
links early-life exposure to EDCs with impaired NER capacity, which would lead 
to increased genetic instability, arise of mutations, and fibroid tumorigenesis.

Peripheral Organs of Preclinical Animal Models.","Rosado-Franco JJ, Ellison AL, White CJ, Price AS, Moore CF, Williams RE, Fridman 
LB, Weerts EM, Williams DW.","The endocannabinoid system is widely expressed throughout the body and is 
comprised of receptors, ligands, and enzymes that maintain metabolic, immune, 
and reproductive homeostasis. Increasing interest in the endocannabinoid system 
has arisen due to these physiologic roles, policy changes leading to more 
widespread recreational use, and the therapeutic potential of Cannabis and 
phytocannabinoids. Rodents have been the primary preclinical model of focus due 
to their relative low cost, short gestational period, genetic manipulation 
strategies, and gold-standard behavioral tests. However, the potential for lack 
of clinical translation to non-human primates and humans is high as 
cross-species comparisons of the endocannabinoid system has not been evaluated. 
To bridge this gap in knowledge, we evaluate the relative gene expression of 14 
canonical and extended endocannabinoid receptors in seven peripheral organs of 
C57/BL6 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, and non-human primate rhesus macaques. 
Notably, we identify species- and organ-specific heterogeneity in 
endocannabinoid receptor distribution where there is surprisingly limited 
overlap among the preclinical models. Importantly, we determined there were only 
five receptors (CB2, GPR18, GPR55, TRPV2, and FAAH) that had identical 
expression patterns in mice, rats, and rhesus macaques. Our findings demonstrate 
a critical, yet previously unappreciated, contributor to challenges of rigor and

Zanowiak J, Hussain S, Zafar H, Lim S, Islam N, Ahmed N.","Background : Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affects South Asians in 
the United States (US). Living with T2D can be challenging due to the distress 
it can create for an individual. Distress associated with diabetes, commonly 
known as diabetes distress (DD), may lead to complications and challenges with 
the management of diabetes. This study aims to describe the prevalence of DD 
among a sample of South Asians in New York City (NYC) seeking care in 
community-based primary care settings and its association with sociodemographic 
characteristics and clinical measures. Methods : This study utilized baseline 
data from the Diabetes Research, Education, and Action for Minorities (DREAM) 
Initiative, an intervention designed to reduce hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) among 
South Asians with uncontrolled T2D in NYC. DD was measured using the Diabetes 
Distress Scale (DDS). First, descriptive statistics were used to analyze 
sociodemographic variables. Chi-square tests assessed categorical variables and 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests assessed continuous variables using a Type I error rate 
of 0.05. Logistic regression was performed to determine if HbA1c and mental 
health, along with other covariates, were associated with dichotomized DDS 
subscales. Results : Overall, 415 participants completed the DDS at baseline. 
Median age was 56 years (IQR: 48-62). A total of 25.9% had high emotional burden 
distress, 6.6% had high physician-related distress, and 22.2% had high 
regimen-related distress based on subscales. In adjusted analyses, individuals 
with any days of poor mental health had significantly higher odds of overall 
distress (OR:3.7, p=0.014), emotional burden distress (OR:4.9, p<0.001), and 
physician-related distress (OR:5.0, p=0.002) compared to individuals with no 
days of poor mental health. Individuals with higher HbA1c had significantly 
higher odds of regimen-related distress (OR:1.31, p=0.007). Conclusions : 
Findings suggest that DD is prevalent among this sample of South Asians with 
diagnosed T2D in NYC. Screening for DD in patients with prediabetes/diabetes 
should be considered by providers to help provide mental and physical health 
services during primary care visits. Future research can also benefit from a 
longitudinal analysis of the impact of DD on diabetes self-management, 
medication adherence, and mental and physical health. Trial registration: This 
study uses baseline data from ""Diabetes Management Intervention For South

Serpooshan V, Coskun A, Jones RM.","The oral microbiome is a complex community that matures with dental development 
while oral health is also a recognized risk factor for systemic disease. Despite 
the oral cavity having a substantial microbial burden, healing of superficial 
oral wounds occurs quickly and with little scarring. By contrast, creation of an 
oro-nasal fistula (ONF), often occurring after surgery to correct a cleft 
palate, is a significant wound healing challenge that is further complicated by 
a connection of the oral and nasal microbiome. In this study, we characterized 
the changes in the oral microbiome of mice following a freshly inflicted wound 
in the oral palate that results in an open and unhealed ONF. Creation of an ONF 
in mice significantly lowered oral microbiome alpha diversity, with concurrent 
blooms of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus lentus, and Staphylococcus 
xylosus in the oral cavity. Treatment of mice with oral antibiotics one week 
prior to ONF infliction resulted in a reduction in the alpha diversity, 
prevented E. faecalis and S. lentus, and S. xylosus blooms, but did not impact 
ONF healing. Strikingly, delivery of the beneficial microbe Lactococcus lactis 
subsp. cremoris (LLC) to the wound bed of the freshly inflicted ONF via a 
PEG-MAL hydrogel vehicle resulted in rapid healing of the ONF. Healing of the 
ONF was associated with the maintenance of relatively high microbiome alpha 
diversity, and limited the abundance of E. faecalis and S. lentus, and S. 
xylosus in the oral cavity. These data demonstrate that a freshly inflicted ONF 
in the murine palate is associated with a dysbiotic oral microbiome state that 
may prevent ONF healing, and a bloom of opportunistic pathogens. The data also 
demonstrate that delivery of a specific beneficial microbe, LLC, to the ONF can 
boost wound healing, can restore and/or preserve oral microbiome diversity, and 
inhibit blooms of opportunistic pathogens.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543508

TN, Fruge AD, Kavazis AN.","We examined the myofibrillar (MyoF) and non-myofibrillar (non-MyoF) proteomic 
profiles of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle of younger (Y, 22±2 years old; n=5) 
and middle-aged participants (MA, 56±8 years old; n=6), and MA following eight 
weeks of knee extensor resistance training (RT, 2d/week). Shotgun/bottom-up 
proteomics in skeletal muscle typically yields wide protein abundance ranges 
that mask lowly expressed proteins. Thus, we adopted a novel approach whereby 
the MyoF and non-MyoF fractions were separately subjected to protein corona 
nanoparticle complex formation prior to digestion and Liquid Chromatography Mass 
Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. A total of 10,866 proteins (4,421 MyoF and 6,445 
non-MyoF) were identified. Across all participants, the number of non-MyoF 
proteins detected averaged to be 5,645 ± 266 (range: 4,888-5,987) and the number 
of MyoF proteins detected averaged to be 2,611 ± 326 (range: 1,944-3,101). 
Differences in the non-MyoF (8.4%) and MyoF (2.5%) proteome were evident between 
age cohorts. Further, most of these age-related non-MyoF proteins (447/543) were 
more enriched in MA versus Y. Several biological processes in the non- MyoF 
fraction were predicted to be operative in MA versus Y including (but not 
limited to) increased cellular stress, mRNA splicing, translation elongation, 
and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Non-MyoF proteins associated with splicing 
and proteostasis were further interrogated, and in agreement with 
bioinformatics, alternative protein variants, spliceosome- associated proteins 
(snRNPs), and proteolysis-related targets were more abundant in MA versus Y. RT 
in MA non-significantly increased VL muscle cross-sectional area (+6.5%, 
p=0.066) and significantly increased knee extensor strength (+8.7%, p=0.048). 
However, RT modestly altered the MyoF (∼0.3%, 11 upregulated and two 
downregulated proteins) and non-MyoF proteomes (∼1.0%, 56 upregulated and eight 
downregulated proteins, p<0.01). Further, RT did not affect predicted biological 
processes in either fraction. Although participant numbers were limited, these 
preliminary results using a novel deep proteomic approach in skeletal muscle 
suggest that aging and RT predominantly affects protein abundances in the 
non-contractile protein pool. However, the marginal proteome adaptations 
occurring with RT suggest either: a) this may be an aging-associated phenomenon, 
b) more rigorous RT may stimulate more robust effects, or c) RT, regardless of 
age, subtly affects skeletal muscle protein abundances in the basal state.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543459

integration in a type I-G CRISPR-Cas system.","Dhingra Y, Sashital DG.","CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems uptake short 'spacer' sequences from foreign 
DNA and incorporate them into the host genome to serve as templates for crRNAs 
that guide interference against future infections. Adaptation in CRISPR systems 
is mediated by Cas1-Cas2 complexes that catalyze integration of prespacer 
substrates into the CRISPR array. Many DNA targeting systems also require Cas4 
endonucleases for functional spacer acquisition. Cas4 selects prespacers 
containing a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and removes the PAM prior to 
integration, both of which are required to ensure host immunization. Cas1 has 
also been shown to function as a nuclease in some systems, but a role for this 
nuclease activity in adaptation has not been demonstrated. We identified a type 
I-G Cas4/1 fusion with a nucleolytically active Cas1 domain that can directly 
participate in prespacer processing. The Cas1 domain is both an integrase and a 
sequence-independent nuclease that cleaves the non-PAM end of a prespacer, 
generating optimal overhang lengths that enable integration at the leader side. 
The Cas4 domain sequence-specifically cleaves the PAM end of the prespacer, 
ensuring integration of the PAM end at the spacer side. The two domains have 
varying metal ion requirements. While Cas4 activity is Mn 2+ dependent, Cas1 
preferentially uses Mg 2+ over Mn 2+ . The dual nuclease activity of Cas4/1 
eliminates the need for additional factors in prespacer processing, making the 
adaptation module self-reliant for prespacer maturation and directional

Jalife J.","BACKGROUND: Andersen-Tawil Syndrome Type 1 (ATS1) is a rare heritable disease 
caused by mutations in the strong inwardly rectifying K + channel Kir2.1. The 
extracellular Cys122-to-Cys154 disulfide bond in the Kir2.1 channel structure is 
crucial for proper folding, but has not been associated with correct channel 
function at the membrane. We tested whether a human mutation at the 
Cys122-to-Cys154 disulfide bridge leads to Kir2.1 channel dysfunction and 
arrhythmias by reorganizing the overall Kir2.1 channel structure and 
destabilizing the open state of the channel.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified a Kir2.1 loss-of-function mutation in Cys122 
(c.366 A>T; p.Cys122Tyr) in a family with ATS1. To study the consequences of 
this mutation on Kir2.1 function we generated a cardiac specific mouse model 
expressing the Kir2.1 C122Y mutation. Kir2.1 C122Y animals recapitulated the 
abnormal ECG features of ATS1, like QT prolongation, conduction defects, and 
increased arrhythmia susceptibility. Kir2.1 C122Y mouse cardiomyocytes showed 
significantly reduced inward rectifier K + (I K1 ) and inward Na + (I Na ) 
current densities independently of normal trafficking ability and localization 
at the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Kir2.1 C122Y formed 
heterotetramers with wildtype (WT) subunits. However, molecular dynamic modeling 
predicted that the Cys122-to-Cys154 disulfide-bond break induced by the C122Y 
mutation provoked a conformational change over the 2000 ns simulation, 
characterized by larger loss of the hydrogen bonds between Kir2.1 and 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) than WT. Therefore, consistent 
with the inability of Kir2.1 C 122 Y channels to bind directly to PIP 2 in 
bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments, the PIP 2 binding pocket 
was destabilized, resulting in a lower conductance state compared with WT. 
Accordingly, on inside-out patch-clamping the C122Y mutation significantly 
blunted Kir2.1 sensitivity to increasing PIP 2 concentrations.
CONCLUSION: The extracellular Cys122-to-Cys154 disulfide bond in the 
tridimensional Kir2.1 channel structure is essential to channel function. We 
demonstrated that ATS1 mutations that break disulfide bonds in the extracellular 
domain disrupt PIP 2 -dependent regulation, leading to channel dysfunction and 
life-threatening arrhythmias.
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE: NOVELTY AND SIGNIFICANCE: What is known? Andersen-Tawil 
Syndrome Type 1 (ATS1) is a rare arrhythmogenic disease caused by 
loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ2 , the gene encoding the strong inward 
rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 responsible for I K1 . Extracellular Cys 122 
and Cys 154 form an intramolecular disulfide bond that is essential for proper 
Kir2.1 channel folding but not considered vital for channel function. 
Replacement of Cys 122 or Cys 154 residues in the Kir2.1 channel with either 
alanine or serine abolished ionic current in Xenopus laevis oocytes. What new 
information does this article contribute? We generated a mouse model that 
recapitulates the main cardiac electrical abnormalities of ATS1 patients 
carrying the C122Y mutation, including prolonged QT interval and 
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.We demonstrate for the first time that 
a single residue mutation causing a break in the extracellular Cys122-to-Cys154 
disulfide-bond leads to Kir2.1 channel dysfunction and arrhythmias in part by 
reorganizing the overall Kir2.1 channel structure, disrupting PIP2-dependent 
Kir2.1 channel function and destabilizing the open state of the channel.Defects 
in Kir2.1 energetic stability alter the functional expression of the 
voltage-gated cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5, one of the main Kir2.1 interactors 
in the macromolecular channelosome complex, contributing to the arrhythmias.The 
data support the idea that susceptibility to arrhythmias and SCD in ATS1 are 
specific to the type and location of the mutation, so that clinical management 
should be different for each patient.Altogether, the results may lead to the 
identification of new molecular targets in the future design of drugs to treat a 
human disease that currently has no defined therapy.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544151

pattern generating circuit.","Cronin EM, Schneider AC, Nadim F, Bucher D.","Neuromodulation lends flexibility to neural circuit operation. However, the 
general notion that different neuromodulators sculpt neural circuit output into 
distinct and characteristic patterns is complicated by interindividual 
variability. In addition, some neuromodulators converge onto the same signaling 
pathways, with similar effects on neurons and synapses. We compared the effects 
of three neuropeptides on the rhythmic pyloric circuit in the crab Cancer 
borealis stomatogastric nervous system. Proctolin (PROC), crustacean 
cardioactive peptide (CCAP), and red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH) all 
activate the same modulatory inward current, I MI , and have convergent actions 
on synapses. However, while PROC targets all four neuron types in the core 
pyloric circuit, CCAP and RPCH target the same subset of only two neurons. After 
removal of spontaneous neuromodulator release, none of the neuropeptides 
restored the control cycle frequency, but all restored the relative timing 
between neuron types. Consequently, differences between neuropeptide effects 
were mainly found in the spiking activity of different neuron types. We 
performed statistical comparisons using the Euclidean distance in the 
multidimensional space of normalized output attributes to obtain a single 
measure of difference between modulatory states. Across preparations, circuit 
output in PROC was distinguishable from CCAP and RPCH, but CCAP and RPCH were 
not. However, we argue that even between PROC and the other two neuropeptides, 
population data overlapped enough to prevent reliable identification of 
individual output patterns as characteristic for a specific neuropeptide. We 
confirm this notion by showing that blind classifications by machine learning 
algorithms are only moderately successful.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543756

Finally, our tools also provide a spatial mapping between the a 3D MRI scan 
(when available) and the 2D slices, which enables accurate 
neuropathological-neuroimaging correlation. We evaluate our toolbox on a 
synthetic dataset and on dissection photographs from two NIH Alzheimer's Disease 
Research Centers (ADRC). Our methodology yields accurate 3D reconstruction and 
automated segmentations that are highly correlated to those obtained from ex 
vivo MRI, and that can detect expected differences between brains with 
Alzheimer's disease and controls. The tools are available as part of our 
widespread neuroimaging suite ""FreeSurfer"" ( 
https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools ).
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: When donated human brains are dissected at brain banks, 
they are first cut into slabs that are routinely photographed just with 
archiving purposes. Here we present a set of novel, open-source computational 
tools that enable 3D reconstruction of these photographs into a volumetric 
dataset, as well as subsequent 3D segmentation of the reconstructed volumes 
(i.e., assigning neuroanatomical labels to every pixel in the images). Our tools 
enable quantitative analyses of the brain at the macroscopic level (e.g., 
measuring volumes of brain regions) without requiring MRI scans of the 
specimens. The tools also provide a spatial mapping between an MRI (if 
available) and the photographs, thus enabling the study of correlations between 
macroscopic and microscopic features (e.g., atrophy vs histology).","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544050

Preprint.","Pre-attentive representation of prediction certainty in autism: A mismatch 
negativity (MMN) study.","Reisli S, Molholm S.","According to predictive processing theories of perception, the brain generates 
predictions to prepare for sensory input, and calibrates certainty of 
predictions based on their likelihood. When an input doesn't match the 
prediction, an error signal leads to updating of the predictive model. Prior 
research suggests altered prediction certainty in autism, but predictive 
processing occurs across the cortical hierarchy, and the stage(s) of processing 
where prediction certainty breaks down is unknown. We therefore tested the 
integrity of prediction certainty in autism at pre-attentive and relatively 
automatic processing stages using the pre-attentive Mismatch Negativity (MMN) 
brain response. The MMN occurs in response to a ""deviant"" presented in a stream 
of ""standards"" and is measured while the participant performs an orthogonal 
task. Most critically, MMN amplitude typically varies with the level of 
certainty associated with the prediction. We recorded high-density EEG while 
presenting adolescents and young adults with and without autism with repetitive 
tones every half second (the standard) interspersed with infrequent pitch and 
inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) deviants. Pitch and ISI deviant probabilities were 
manipulated at 4, 8, or 16% within a block of trials to test whether MMN 
amplitude varied in a typical manner with respect to probability. For both 
groups, Pitch-MMN amplitude increased as the probability of deviance decreased. 
Unexpectedly, ISI-MMN amplitude did not reliably vary by probability in either 
group. Our Pitch-MMN findings suggest intact neural representation of 
pre-attentive prediction certainty in autism, addressing a critical knowledge 
gap in autism research. The implications of these findings are considered.
LAY SUMMARY: Our brains are always trying to predict what will happen next. For 
example, when you open your utensil drawer, it would be surprising to see books 
because your brain expected to see utensils. In our study, we looked at whether 
the brains of autistic individuals automatically and accurately recognize when 
something unexpected happens. Results showed similar brain patterns in 
individuals with and without autism, suggesting that responses to prediction 
violations are generated in a typical manner during early cortical information 
processing.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543878

Das US, Ghosh S, Dimopoulos T, Babu A, Connelly C, FitzGerald GA, Beers MF.","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic parenchymal lung disease 
characterized by repetitive alveolar cell injury, myofibroblast proliferation, 
and excessive extracellular matrix deposition for which unmet need persists for 
effective therapeutics. The bioactive eicosanoid, prostaglandin F2 α , and its 
cognate receptor FPr ( Ptfgr ) are implicated as a TGF β 1 independent signaling 
hub for IPF. To assess this, we leveraged our published murine PF model (I ER 
-Sftpc I 73 T ) expressing a disease-associated missense mutation in the 
surfactant protein C ( Sftpc ) gene. Tamoxifen treated I ER - Sftpc I 73 T mice 
develop an early multiphasic alveolitis and transition to spontaneous fibrotic 
remodeling by 28 days. I ER - Sftpc I 73 T mice crossed to a Ptgfr null (FPr - / 
- ) line showed attenuated weight loss and gene dosage dependent rescue of 
mortality compared to FPr +/+ cohorts. I ER - Sftpc I 73 T /FPr - / - mice also 
showed reductions in multiple fibrotic endpoints for which administration of 
nintedanib was not additive. Single cell RNA sequencing, pseudotime analysis, 
and in vitro assays demonstrated Ptgfr expression predominantly within 
adventitial fibroblasts which were reprogrammed to an 
""inflammatory/transitional"" cell state in a PGF2 α / FPr dependent manner. 
Collectively, the findings provide evidence for a role for PGF2 α signaling in 
IPF, mechanistically identify a susceptible fibroblast subpopulation, and 
establish a benchmark effect size for disruption of this pathway in mitigating 
fibrotic lung remodeling.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.543956

pressure.","Mata-Daboin A, Garrud TAC, Fernandez-Pena C, Peixoto-Neves D, Leo MD, 
Bernardelli AK, Singh P, Malik KU, Jaggar JH.","Endothelial cells (ECs) regulate vascular contractility to control regional 
organ blood flow and systemic blood pressure. Several cation channels are 
expressed in ECs which regulate arterial contractility. In contrast, the 
molecular identity and physiological functions of anion channels in ECs is 
unclear. Here, we generated tamoxifen-inducible, EC-specific TMEM16A knockout ( 
TMEM16A ecKO) mice to investigate the functional significance of this chloride 
(Cl - ) channel in the resistance vasculature. Our data demonstrate that TMEM16A 
channels generate calcium-activated Cl - currents in ECs of control ( TMEM16A 
fl/fl ) mice that are absent in ECs of TMEM16A ecKO mice. Acetylcholine (ACh), a 
muscarinic receptor agonist, and GSK101, a TRPV4 agonist, activate TMEM16A 
currents in ECs. Single molecule localization microscopy data indicate that 
surface TMEM16A and TRPV4 clusters locate in very close nanoscale proximity, 
with ∼18% exhibiting overlap in ECs. ACh stimulates TMEM16A currents by 
activating Ca 2+ influx through surface TRPV4 channels without altering the size 
or density of TMEM16A or TRPV4 surface clusters, their spatial proximity or 
colocalization. ACh-induced activation of TMEM16A channels in ECs produces 
hyperpolarization in pressurized arteries. ACh, GSK101 and intraluminal ATP, 
another vasodilator, all dilate pressurized arteries through TMEM16A channel 
activation in ECs. Furthermore, EC-specific knockout of TMEM16A channels 
elevates systemic blood pressure in conscious mice. In summary, these data 
indicate that vasodilators stimulate TRPV4 channels, leading to Ca 2+ -dependent 
activation of nearby TMEM16A channels in ECs to produce arterial 
hyperpolarization, vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure. We identify 
TMEM16A as an anion channel present in ECs that regulates arterial contractility 
and blood pressure.

Yoshikawa M, Kojima H, Okabe M, Cheng AG.","Cochlear melanocytes are intermediate cells in the stria vascularis that 
generate endocochlear potentials required for auditory function. Human PAX3 
mutations cause Waardenburg syndrome and abnormalities of melanocytes, 
manifested as congenital hearing loss and hypopigmentation of skin, hair and 
eyes. However, the underlying mechanism of hearing loss remains unclear. During 
development, cochlear melanocytes in the stria vascularis are dually derived 
from Pax3-Cre+ melanoblasts migrating from neuroepithelial cells including 
neural crest cells and Plp1+ Schwann cell precursors originated from also neural 
crest cells, differentiating in a basal-apical manner. Here, using a Pax3-Cre 
mouse line, we found that Pax3 deficiency causes foreshortened cochlea, 
malformed vestibular apparatus, and neural tube defects. Lineage tracing and in 
situ hybridization show that Pax3-Cre derivatives contribute to S100+ , Kir4.1+ 
and Dct+ melanocytes (intermediate cells) in the developing stria vascularis, 
all significantly diminished in Pax3 mutant animals. Taken together, these

Physical, Mental, and Behavioral Health.","Lam-Hine T, Riddell CA, Bradshaw PT, Omi M, Allen AM.","INTRODUCTION: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor 
adulthood health, with individuals experiencing multiple ACEs at greatest risk. 
Multiracial people have high mean ACEs scores and elevated risk of several 
outcomes, but are infrequently the focus of health equity research. This study 
aimed to determine whether this group should be targeted for prevention efforts.
METHODS: We analyzed Waves 1 (1994-95), 3 (2001-02), and 4 (2008-09) of the 
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 12,372) in 2023, 
estimating associations between four or more ACEs and physical (metabolic 
syndrome, hypertension, asthma), mental (anxiety, depression), and behavioral 
(suicidal ideation, drug use) outcomes. We estimated risk ratios for each 
outcome in modified Poisson models with a race × ACEs interaction, adjusted for 
hypothesized confounders of the ACE-outcome relationships. We used the 
interaction contrast to estimate excess cases per 1,000 individuals for each 
group relative to Multiracial participants.
RESULTS: Excess case estimates of asthma were significantly smaller for White 
(-123 cases, 95% CI: -251, -4), Black (-141, 95% CI: -285, -6), and Asian (-169, 
95% CI: -334, -7) participants compared to Multiracial participants. Black 
(-100, 95% CI: -189, -10), Asian (-163, 95% CI: -247, -79) and Indigenous (-144, 
95% CI: -252, -42) participants had significantly fewer excess cases of and 
weaker (p < 0.001) relative scale association with anxiety compared to 
Multiracial participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted associations between ACEs and asthma or anxiety appear

Preprint.",Recording morphogen signals reveals origins of gastruloid symmetry breaking.,"McNamara HM, Solley SC, Adamson B, Chan MM, Toettcher JE.","When cultured in three dimensional spheroids, mammalian stem cells can 
reproducibly self-organize a single anterior-posterior axis and sequentially 
differentiate into structures resembling the primitive streak and tailbud. 
Whereas the embryo's body axes are instructed by spatially patterned 
extra-embryonic cues, it is unknown how these stem cell gastruloids break 
symmetry to reproducibly define a single anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. Here, we 
use synthetic gene circuits to trace how early intracellular signals predict 
cells' future anterior-posterior position in the gastruloid. We show that Wnt 
signaling evolves from a homogeneous state to a polarized state, and identify a 
critical 6-hour time period when single-cell Wnt activity predicts future 
cellular position, prior to the appearance of polarized signaling patterns or 
morphology. Single-cell RNA sequencing and live-imaging reveal that early 
Wnt-high and Wnt-low cells contribute to distinct cell types and suggest that 
axial symmetry breaking is driven by sorting rearrangements involving 
differential cell adhesion. We further extend our approach to other canonical 
embryonic signaling pathways, revealing that even earlier heterogeneity in TGFβ 
signaling predicts A-P position and modulates Wnt signaling during the critical 
time period. Our study reveals a sequence of dynamic cellular processes that 
transform a uniform cell aggregate into a polarized structure and demonstrates 
that a morphological axis can emerge out of signaling heterogeneity and cell 
movements even in the absence of exogenous patterning cues.

Preprint.",Learning Peptide Properties with Positive Examples Only.,"Ansari M, White AD.","Deep learning can create accurate predictive models by exploiting existing 
large-scale experimental data, and guide the design of molecules. However, a 
major barrier is the requirement of both positive and negative examples in the 
classical supervised learning frameworks. Notably, most peptide databases come 
with missing information and low number of observations on negative examples, as 
such sequences are hard to obtain using high-throughput screening methods. To 
address this challenge, we solely exploit the limited known positive examples in 
a semi-supervised setting, and discover peptide sequences that are likely to map 
to certain antimicrobial properties via positive-unlabeled learning (PU). In 
particular, we use the two learning strategies of adapting base classifier and 
reliable negative identification to build deep learning models for inferring 
solubility, hemolysis, binding against SHP-2, and non-fouling activity of 
peptides, given their sequence. We evaluate the predictive performance of our PU

controlling distinct behaviors has benefited greatly from the simplicity offered 
by zebrafish. Electrophysiological studies have shown that additional to 
connectivity, understanding of circuitry requires identification of functional 
specializations among individual circuit components, such as those that regulate 
levels of transmitter release and neuronal excitability. In this study we use 
single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify molecular distinctions causal 
to the unique physiology of primary motoneuron (PMn) function, as well as 
specialized interneurons that are tailored specifically for mediation of the 
powerful escape response. Transcriptional profiles of larval zebrafish spinal

ion channel types and synaptic proteins termed functional 'cassettes'. These 
cassettes serve the purpose of generating maximal power output, essential for 
rapid escape. The ion channel cassette, in particular, acts through promoting 
high frequency firing of action potentials and augmented transmitter release at 
the neuromuscular junction. Our analysis highlights the utility of scRNAseq in

Preprint.","Astrocyte store-operated calcium entry is required for centrally mediated 
neuropathic pain.","Prokhorenko MA, Smyth JT.","Central sensitization is a critical step in chronic neuropathic pain formation 
following acute nerve injury. Central sensitization is defined by nociceptive 
and somatosensory circuitry changes in the spinal cord leading to dysfunction of 
antinociceptive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic cells (Li et al., 2019), 
amplification of ascending nociceptive signals, and hypersensitivity (Woolf, 
2011). Astrocytes are key mediators of the neurocircuitry changes that underlie 
central sensitization and neuropathic pain, and astrocytes respond to and 
regulate neuronal function through complex Ca 2+ signaling mechanisms. Clear 
definition of the astrocyte Ca 2+ signaling mechanisms involved in central 
sensitization may lead to new therapeutic targets for treatment of chronic 
neuropathic pain, as well as enhance our understanding of the complex central 
nervous system (CNS) adaptions that occur following nerve injury. Ca 2+ release 
from astrocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ stores via the inositol 
1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R) is required for centrally mediated 
neuropathic pain (Kim et al, 2016); however recent evidence suggests the 
involvement of additional astrocyte Ca 2+ signaling mechanisms. We therefore 
investigated the role of astrocyte store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE), which 
mediates Ca 2+ influx in response to ER Ca 2+ store depletion. Using an adult 
Drosophila melanogaster model of central sensitization based on thermal 
allodynia in response to leg amputation nerve injury (Khuong et al., 2019), we 
show that astrocytes exhibit SOCE-dependent Ca 2+ signaling events three to four 
days following nerve injury. Astrocyte-specific suppression of Stim and Orai, 
the key mediators of SOCE Ca 2+ influx, completely inhibited the development of 
thermal allodynia seven days following injury, and also inhibited the loss of 
ventral nerve cord (VNC) GABAergic neurons that is required for central 
sensitization in flies. We lastly show that constitutive SOCE in astrocytes 
results in thermal allodynia even in the absence of nerve injury. Our results 
collectively demonstrate that astrocyte SOCE is necessary and sufficient for 
central sensitization and development of hypersensitivity in Drosophila , adding 
key new understanding to the astrocyte Ca 2+ signaling mechanisms involved in 
chronic pain.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544231

numerous insects and pests. Its immense application poses harmful effects on 
various non-target organisms as well. Therefore, searching the effective methods 
for the degradation of fipronil is imperative and logical. In this study, 
fipronil-degrading bacterial species are isolated and characterized from diverse 
environments using a culture-dependent method followed by 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed the homology of organisms with 
Acinetobacter sp., Streptomyces sp., Pseudomonas sp., Agrobacterium sp., 
Rhodococcus sp., Kocuria sp., Priestia sp., Bacillus sp., Pantoea sp. The 
bacterial degradation potential for fipronil was analyzed through 
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. Incubation-based degradation studies 
revealed that Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodococcus sp. were found to be the most 
potent isolates that degraded fipronil at 100 mg L-1 concentration, with removal 
efficiencies of 85.97 % and 83.64 %, respectively. Kinetic parameter studies, 
following the Michaelis-Menten model, also revealed the high degradation 
efficiency of these isolates. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)

brain. In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in developing 
technologies that can record neural activity at cellular resolution at multiple 
spatial and temporal scales. However, these technologies are primarily designed 
for studying the mammalian brain during head fixation - wherein the behavior of 
the animal is highly constrained. Miniaturized devices for studying neural 
activity in freely behaving animals are largely confined to recording from small 
brain regions owing to performance limitations. We present a cranial exoskeleton 
that assists mice in maneuvering neural recording headstages that are orders of 
magnitude larger and heavier than the mice, while they navigate physical 
behavioral environments. Force sensors embedded within the headstage are used to 
detect the mouse's milli-Newton scale cranial forces which then control the x, 
y, and yaw motion of the exoskeleton via an admittance controller. We discovered 
optimal controller tuning parameters that enable mice to locomote at 
physiologically realistic velocities and accelerations while maintaining natural 
walking gait. Mice maneuvering headstages weighing up to 1.5 kg can make turns, 
navigate 2D arenas, and perform a navigational decision-making task with the 
same performance as when freely behaving. We designed an imaging headstage and 
an electrophysiology headstage for the cranial exoskeleton to record brain-wide 
neural activity in mice navigating 2D arenas. The imaging headstage enabled 
recordings of Ca 2+ activity of 1000s of neurons distributed across the dorsal 
cortex. The electrophysiology headstage supported independent control of up to 4 
silicon probes, enabling simultaneous recordings from 100s of neurons across

Bartesaghi A, Zhang P.","A significant part of the human genome consists of endogenous retroviruses 
sequences. Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most recently acquired 
endogenous retrovirus, is activated and expressed in many cancers and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and possibly contributes to the aging process. To 
understand the molecular architecture of endogenous retroviruses, we determined 
the structure of immature HERV-K from native virus-like particles (VLPs) using 
cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging (cryoET STA). The HERV-K VLPs 
show a greater distance between the viral membrane and immature capsid lattice, 
correlating with the presence of additional peptides, SP1 and p15, between the 
capsid (CA) and matrix (MA) proteins compared to the other retroviruses. The 
resulting cryoET STA map of the immature HERV-K capsid at 3.2 Å resolution shows 
a hexamer unit oligomerized through a 6-helix bundle which is further stabilized 
by a small molecule in the same way as the IP6 in immature HIV-1 capsid. The 
HERV-K immature CA hexamer assembles into the immature lattice via highly 
conserved dimmer and trimer interfaces, whose interactions were further detailed 
through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and supported by mutational 
studies. A large conformational change mediated by the flexible linker between 
the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of CA occurs between the immature and 
the mature HERV-K capsid protein, analogous to HIV-1. Comparison between HERV-K

J, Bassik MC, Franck C, Bollyky PL, Chaudhuri O.","Circulating monocytes are recruited to the tumor microenvironment, where they 
can differentiate into macrophages that mediate tumor progression. To reach the 
tumor microenvironment, monocytes must first extravasate and migrate through the 
type-1 collagen rich stromal matrix. The viscoelastic stromal matrix around 
tumors not only stiffens relative to normal stromal matrix, but often exhibits 
enhanced viscous characteristics, as indicated by a higher loss tangent or 
faster stress relaxation rate. Here, we studied how changes in matrix stiffness 
and viscoelasticity, impact the three-dimensional migration of monocytes through 
stromal-like matrices. Interpenetrating networks of type-1 collagen and 
alginate, which enable independent tunability of stiffness and stress relaxation 
over physiologically relevant ranges, were used as confining matrices for 
three-dimensional culture of monocytes. Increased stiffness and faster stress 
relaxation independently enhanced the 3D migration of monocytes. Migrating 
monocytes have an ellipsoidal or rounded wedge-like morphology, reminiscent of 
amoeboid migration, with accumulation of actin at the trailing edge. Matrix 
adhesions and Rho-mediated contractility were dispensable for monocyte migration 
in 3D, but migration did require actin polymerization and myosin contractility. 
Mechanistic studies indicate that actin polymerization at the leading edge 
generates protrusive forces that open a path for the monocytes to migrate 
through in the confining viscoelastic matrices. Taken together, our findings 
implicate matrix stiffness and stress relaxation as key mediators of monocyte 
migration and reveal how monocytes use pushing forces at the leading edge 
mediated by actin polymerization to generate migration paths in confining 
viscoelastic matrices.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cell migration is essential for numerous biological 
processes in health and disease, including for immune cell trafficking. Monocyte 
immune cells migrate through extracellular matrix to the tumor microenvironment 
where they can play a role in regulating cancer progression. Increased 
extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and viscoelasticity have been implicated in 
cancer progression, but the impact of these changes in the ECM on monocyte 
migration remains unknown. Here, we find that increased ECM stiffness and 
viscoelasticity promote monocyte migration. Interestingly, we reveal a 
previously undescribed adhesion-independent mode of migration whereby monocytes 
generate a path to migrate through pushing forces at the leading edge. These 
findings help elucidate how changes in the tumor microenvironment impact 
monocyte trafficking and thereby disease progression.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544394

Preprint.","Proactive Versus Reactive Control Strategies Differentially Mediate Alcohol 
Drinking in Wistar and P rats.","Morningstar MD, Timme NM, Ma B, Cornwell E, Galbari T, Lapish CC.","Problematic alcohol consumption is associated with deficits in decision-making, 
and alterations in prefrontal cortex neural activity likely contributes. We 
hypothesized that differences in cognitive control would be evident between male 
Wistar rats and a model for genetic risk for alcohol use disorder 
(alcohol-preferring P rats). Cognitive control can be split into proactive and 
reactive components. Proactive control maintains goal-directed behavior 
independent of a stimulus whereas reactive control elicits goal-directed 
behavior at the time of a stimulus. We hypothesized that Wistars would show 
proactive control over alcohol-seeking whereas P rats would show reactive 
control over alcohol-seeking. Neural ensembles were recorded from prefrontal 
cortex during an alcohol seeking task that utilized two session types. On 
congruent sessions the CS+ was on the same side as alcohol access. Incongruent 
sessions presented alcohol opposite the CS+. Wistars, but not P rats, exhibited 
an increase in incorrect approaches during incongruent sessions, suggesting that 
Wistars utilized the previously learned task-rule. This motivated the hypothesis 
that ensemble activity reflecting proactive control would be observable in 
Wistars but not P rats. While P rats showed differences in neural activity at 
times relevant for alcohol delivery, Wistars showed differences prior to 
approaching the sipper. These results support our hypothesis that Wistars are 
more likely to engage proactive cognitive-control strategies whereas P rats are 
more likely to engage reactive cognitive control strategies. Although P rats

from two donors to low (2.8mM) and high (15.0mM) glucose concentrations over 24 
hours, assaying the transcriptome at seven time points using single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq). We modeled time as both a discrete and continuous 
variable to determine momentary and longitudinal changes in transcription 
associated with islet time in culture or glucose exposure. Across all cell 
types, we identified 1,528 genes associated with time, 1,185 genes associated 
with glucose exposure, and 845 genes associated with interaction effects between 
time and glucose. We clustered differentially expressed genes across cell types 
and found 347 modules of genes with similar expression patterns across time and 
glucose conditions, including two beta cell modules enriched in genes associated 
with T2D. Finally, by integrating genomic features from this study and genetic 
summary statistics for T2D and related traits, we nominate 374 candidate 
effector genes that may underlie genetic associations for T2D and related 
traits.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543931

biological tissues.","Leartprapun N, Zeng Z, Hajjarian Z, Bossuyt V, Nadkarni SK.","Mechanical transformation of tissue is not merely a symptom but a decisive 
driver in pathological processes. Comprising intricate network of cells,

Preprint.",Transcription dosage compensation does not occur in Down syndrome.,"Hunter S, Dowell RD, Hendrix J, Freeman J, Allen MA.","BACKGROUND: Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, describes the genetic 
condition of having an extra copy of chromosome 21. The increase in DNA copy 
number has led to the ""DNA dosage hypothesis"", which claims that the level of 
gene transcription is proportional to the gene's DNA copy number. Yet many 
reports have suggested that a proportion of chromosome 21 genes are dosage 
compensated back towards typical expression levels (1.0x). In contrast, other 
reports suggest that dosage compensation is not a common mechanism of gene 
regulation in Trisomy 21, providing support to the DNA dosage hypothesis.
RESULTS: In our work, we use both simulated and real data to dissect the 
elements of differential expression analysis that can lead to the appearance of 
dosage compensation even when compensation is demonstrably absent. Using 
lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a family of an individual with Down 
syndrome, we demonstrate that dosage compensation is nearly absent at both 
nascent transcription (GRO-seq) and steady-state RNA (RNA-seq) levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional dosage compensation does not occur in Down 
syndrome. Simulated data containing no dosage compensation can appear to have 
dosage compensation when analyzed via standard methods. Moreover, some 
chromosome 21 genes that appear to be dosage compensated are consistent with 
allele specific expression.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.543933

Preprint.",Co-infecting phages impede each other's entry into the cell.,"Nguyen TVP, Wu Y, Yao T, Trinh JT, Zeng L, Chemla YR, Golding I.","Bacteriophage lambda tunes its propensity to lysogenize based on the number of 
viral genome copies inside the infected cell. Viral self-counting is believed to 
serve as a way of inferring the abundance of available hosts in the environment. 
This interpretation is premised on an accurate mapping between the extracellular 
phage-to-bacteria ratio and the intracellular multiplicity of infection (MOI). 
However, here we show this premise to be untrue. By simultaneously labeling 
phage capsids and genomes, we find that, while the number of phages landing on 
each cell reliably samples the population ratio, the number of phages entering 
the cell does not. Single-cell infections, followed in a microfluidic device and 
interpreted using a stochastic model, reveal that the probability and rate of 
individual phage entries decrease with MOI. This decrease reflects an 
MOI-dependent perturbation to host physiology caused by phage landing, evidenced 
by compromised membrane integrity and loss of membrane potential. The dependence 
of phage entry dynamics on the surrounding medium is found to result in a strong 
impact of environmental conditions on the infection outcome, while the 
protracted entry of co-infecting phages increases the cell-to-cell variability 
in infection outcome at a given MOI. Our findings demonstrate the previously

effects. Combining different types of treatments may produce larger effects. 
This study used a 2×2 factorial randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to 
combine procedural and behavioral treatments for CLBP. The study aims were to: 
(1) assess feasibility of conducting a factorial RCT of these treatments; and 
(2) estimate individual and combined treatment effects of (a) lumbar 
radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) of the dorsal ramus medial branch nerves (vs. a 
simulated LRFA control procedure) and (b) Activity Tracker-Informed 
Video-Enabled Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program for CLBP (AcTIVE-CBT) (vs. an 
educational control treatment) on back-related disability at 3 months 
post-randomization. Participants (n=13) were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. 
Feasibility goals included an enrollment proportion ≥30%, a randomization 
proportion ≥80%, and a ≥80% proportion of randomized participants completing the 
3-month Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) primary outcome endpoint. 
An intent-to-treat analysis was used. The enrollment proportion was 62%, the

primary outcome. Though not statistically significant, there was a beneficial, 
moderate-magnitude effect of LRFA vs. control on 3-month RMDQ (-3.25 RMDQ 
points; 95% CI: -10.18, 3.67). There was a significant, beneficial, 
large-magnitude effect of AcTIVE-CBT vs. control (-6.29, 95% CI: -10.97, -1.60). 
Though not statistically significant, there was a beneficial, large effect of

Preprint.","Utilizing Aggregated Molecular Phenotype (AMP) Scores to Visualize Simultaneous 
Molecular Changes in Mass Spectrometry Imaging Data.","Chappel JR, King ME, Fleming J, Eberlin LS, Reif DM, Baker ES.","Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has gained increasing popularity for 
tissue-based diagnostics due to its ability to identify and visualize molecular 
characteristics unique to different phenotypes within heterogeneous samples. 
Data from MSI experiments are often visualized using single ion images and 
further analyzed using machine learning and multivariate statistics to identify 
m/ z features of interest and create predictive models for phenotypic 
classification. However, often only a single molecule or m/z feature is 
visualized per ion image, and mainly categorical classifications are provided 
from the predictive models. As an alternative approach, we developed an 
aggregated molecular phenotype (AMP) scoring system. AMP scores are generated 
using an ensemble machine learning approach to first select features 
differentiating phenotypes, weight the features using logistic regression, and 
combine the weights and feature abundances. AMP scores are then scaled between 0 
and 1, with lower values generally corresponding to class 1 phenotypes 
(typically control) and higher scores relating to class 2 phenotypes. AMP scores 
therefore allow the evaluation of multiple features simultaneously and showcase 
the degree to which these features correlate with various phenotypes, leading to 
high diagnostic accuracy and interpretability of predictive models. Here, AMP 
score performance was evaluated using metabolomic data collected from desorption 
electrospray ionization (DESI) MSI. Initial comparisons of cancerous human 
tissues to normal or benign counterparts illustrated that AMP scores 
distinguished phenotypes with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. 
Furthermore, when combined with spatial coordinates, AMP scores allow 
visualization of tissue sections in one map with distinguished phenotypic 
borders, highlighting their diagnostic utility.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543306

non-model pupfish radiation.","Palominos MF, Muhl V, Richards EJ, Martin CH.","Understanding the origins of new species with novel adaptations is a fundamental 
question in biology that also provides an opportunity to uncover new genes and 
regulatory networks with potential clinical relevance. Here we demonstrate a new 
role for galr2 in vertebrate craniofacial development using a non-model adaptive 
radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island in the 
Bahamas. We confirmed the loss of a Sry transcription factor binding site in 
scale-eating pupfish and found significant spatial differences in galr2 
expression among pupfish species in the Meckel's cartilage and premaxilla using 
in situ hybridization. We then experimentally confirmed a novel function for 
Galr2 in craniofacial development and jaw elongation by exposing embryos to 
Galr2. Galr2-inhibition reduced Meckel's cartilage length and increased 
chondrocyte density in both trophic specialists but not in the generalist 
genetic background. We propose a mechanism for jaw elongation in scale-eaters 
based on the reduced expression of galr2 putatively due to the loss of the Sry 
binding site that results in reduced opportunities for binding with their 
endogenous ligand during craniofacial chondrogenesis. Fewer Galr2 receptors in 
the scale-eater Meckel's cartilage may result in their enlarged jaw lengths as 
adults by limiting opportunities for Galr2 antagonists to bind to these 
receptors during development. Our findings illustrate the growing utility of 
linking candidate adaptive SNPs in non-model vertebrate systems with highly 
divergent phenotypes to novel gene functions with potential implications for

Preprint.",Heterogeneity of foam cell biogenesis across diseases.,"Guerrini V, Prideaux B, Khan R, Subbian S, Wang Y, Sadimin E, Pawar S, Ukey R, 
Singer EA, Xue C, Gennaro ML.","Foam cells are dysfunctional, lipid-laden macrophages associated with chronic 
inflammation of infectious and non-infectious origin. For decades, the paradigm 
of foam cell biology has been atherogenesis, in which macrophages accumulate 
cholesteryl esters. Our previous work showed that foam cells in tuberculous lung 
lesions are surprisingly triglyceride-rich, suggesting multiple modalities of 
foam cell biogenesis. In the present study, we used matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging to assess the spatial 
distribution of storage lipids relative to foam-cell-rich areas in murine lungs 
infected with the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans and in human papillary 
renal cell carcinoma resection tissues. We also analyzed neutral lipid content 
and the transcriptional program of lipid-laden macrophages generated under 
corresponding in vitro conditions. The in vivo data were consistent with in 
vitro findings showing that C. neoformans -infected macrophages accumulated 
triglycerides, while macrophages exposed to human renal cell 
carcinoma-conditioned medium accumulated both triglycerides and cholesteryl 
esters. Moreover, macrophage transcriptome analyses provided evidence for 
condition-specific metabolic remodeling. The in vitro data also showed that 
although both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and C. neoformans infections induced 
triglyceride accumulation in macrophages, they did so by different molecular 
mechanisms, as evidenced by different sensitivity of lipid accumulation to the 
drug rapamycin and the characteristics of macrophage transcriptome remodeling. 
Collectively, these data demonstrate that the mechanisms of foam cell formation 
are specific to the disease microenvironment. Since foam cells have been 
regarded as targets of pharmacological intervention in several diseases, 
recognizing that their formation is disease-specific opens new research 
directions of biomedical significance.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Chronic inflammatory states of infectious and 
non-infectious etiology are associated with dysfunctional immune responses. 
Primary contributors are foam cells, lipid-laden macrophages exhibiting impaired 
or pathogenic immune functions. In contrast with the long-standing paradigm 
derived from atherosclerosis in which foam cells are cholesterol-laden, our work 
demonstrates that foam cells are heterogeneous. Utilizing bacterial, fungal, and 
cancer models, we show that foam cells may accumulate various storage lipids 
(triglycerides and/or cholesteryl esters) by mechanisms that depend on 
disease-specific microenvironments. Thus, we present a new framework for foam 
cell biogenesis in which the atherosclerosis paradigm represents only a specific 
case. Since foam cells are a potential therapeutic target, understanding their 
mechanisms of biogenesis will provide knowledge needed for novel therapeutic 
approaches.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.542766

CL.","Osteoarthritis ( OA ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) are joint diseases that 
are associated with pain and lost quality of life. No disease modifying OA drugs 
are currently available. RA treatments are better established but are not always 
effective and can cause immune suppression. Here, an MMP13-selective siRNA 
conjugate was developed that, when delivered intravenously, docks onto 
endogenous albumin and promotes preferential accumulation in articular cartilage 
and synovia of OA and RA joints. MMP13 expression was diminished upon 
intravenous delivery of MMP13 siRNA conjugates, consequently decreasing multiple 
histological and molecular markers of disease severity, while also reducing 
clinical manifestations such as swelling (RA) and joint pressure sensitivity (RA 
and OA). Importantly, MMP13 silencing provided more comprehensive OA treatment 
efficacy than standard of care (steroids) or experimental MMP inhibitors. These 
data demonstrate the utility of albumin 'hitchhiking' for drug delivery to 
arthritic joints, and establish the therapeutic utility of systemically 
delivered anti-MMP13 siRNA conjugates in OA and RA.
EDITORIAL SUMMARY: Lipophilic siRNA conjugates optimized for albumin binding and 
""hitchhiking"" can be leveraged to achieve preferential delivery to and gene 
silencing activity within arthritic joints. Chemical stabilization of the 
lipophilic siRNA enables intravenous siRNA delivery without lipid or polymer 
encapsulation. Using siRNA sequences targeting MMP13, a key driver of

Preprint.","A Transient High-dimensional Geometry Affords Stable Conjunctive Subspaces for 
Efficient Action Selection.","Kikumoto A, Bhandari A, Shibata K, Badre D.","Flexible action selection requires cognitive control mechanisms capable of 
mapping the same inputs to diverse output actions depending on goals and 
contexts. How the brain encodes information to enable this capacity remains one 
of the longstanding and fundamental problems in cognitive neuroscience. From a 
neural state-space perspective, solving this problem requires a control 
representation that can disambiguate similar input neural states, making 
task-critical dimensions separable depending on the context. Moreover, for 
action selection to be robust and time-invariant, control representations must 
be stable in time, thereby enabling efficient readout by downstream processing 
units. Thus, an ideal control representation should leverage geometry and 
dynamics that maximize the separability and stability of neural trajectories for 
task computations. Here, using novel EEG decoding methods, we investigated how 
the geometry and dynamics of control representations constrain flexible action 
selection in the human brain. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that 
encoding a temporally stable conjunctive subspace that integrates stimulus, 
response, and context (i.e., rule) information in a high-dimensional geometry 
achieves the separability and stability needed for context-dependent action 
selection. Human participants performed a task that requires context-dependent 
action selection based on pre-instructed rules. Participants were cued to 
respond immediately at varying intervals following stimulus presentation, which 
forced responses at different states in neural trajectories. We discovered that 
in the moments before successful responses, there was a transient expansion of 
representational dimensionality that separated conjunctive subspaces. Further, 
we found that the dynamics stabilized in the same time window, and that the 
timing of entry into this stable and high-dimensional state predicted the 
quality of response selection on individual trials. These results establish the 
neural geometry and dynamics the human brain needs for flexible control over 
behavior.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544428

immune system. These bottlenecks restrict the inoculum and largely determine 
whether pathogen exposure results in disease. Infection bottlenecks therefore 
quantify the effectiveness of immune barriers. Here, using a model of 
Escherichia coli systemic infection, we identify bottlenecks that tighten or 
widen with higher inoculum sizes, revealing that the efficacy of innate immune 
responses can increase or decrease with pathogen dose. We term this concept 
""dose scaling"". During E. coli systemic infection, dose scaling is tissue 
specific, dependent on the LPS receptor TLR4, and can be recapitulated by 
mimicking high doses with killed bacteria. Scaling is therefore due to sensing 
of pathogen molecules rather than interactions between the host and live 
bacteria. We propose that dose scaling quantitatively links innate immunity with 
infection bottlenecks and is a valuable framework for understanding how the

response against osteosarcoma.","Cho MM, Song L, Quamine AE, Szewc F, Shi L, Erbe AK, Ebben JD, Turicek DP, Kline 
JM, Lafeber EO, Phillips MF, Ceas AS, Sondel PM, Capitini CM.","BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) patients that present with metastatic disease have 
a poor prognosis and no curative options. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant 
(alloBMT) is curative for hematologic malignancies through the 
graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect, but to date has been ineffective for solid 
tumors like OS. CD155 is expressed on OS and interacts strongly with the 
inhibitory receptors TIGIT and CD96 but also binds to the activating receptor 
DNAM-1 on natural killer (NK) cells but has never been targeted after alloBMT. 
Combining adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK (alloNK) cells with CD155 
checkpoint blockade after alloBMT may enhance a GVT effect against OS but could 
enhance toxicities like graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD).
METHODS: Ex vivo activated and expanded murine NK cells were generated with 
soluble IL-15/IL-15Rα. AlloNK and syngeneic NK (synNK) cell phenotype, 
cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and degranulation against the 
CD155-expressing murine OS cell line K7M2 were assessed in vitro. Mice bearing 
pulmonary OS metastases underwent alloBMT followed by infusion of alloNK cells 
with combinations of anti-CD155 and anti-DNAM-1 blockade. Tumor growth, GVHD and 
survival were monitored and differential gene expression of lung tissue was 
assessed by RNA microarray.
RESULTS: AlloNK cells exhibited superior cytotoxicity against CD155-expressing 
OS compared to synNK cells, and this activity was further enhanced by CD155 
blockade. CD155 blockade increased alloNK cell degranulation and interferon 
gamma production through DNAM-1, as these functions were abrogated during DNAM-1 
blockade. In vivo, CD155 blockade after alloBMT increased survival and decreased 
OS disease burden with no exacerbation of GVHD. Treatment with combination CD155 
and DNAM-1 blockade ameliorated survival and tumor control benefits seen with 
CD155 blockade alone. In mice treated with CD155 blockade, genes related to NK 
cell cytotoxicity were upregulated. DNAM-1 blockade resulted in upregulation of 
NK cell inhibition and T cell function gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of infusing 
alloNK cells with CD155 blockade to mount a GVT effect against OS and show 
benefits are in part through DNAM-1. Defining the hierarchy of receptors that 
govern alloNK responses will be critical to translating combination adoptive NK 
cell and immune checkpoint inhibition for patients with solid tumors treated 
with alloBMT.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) 
has yet to show efficacy in treating solid tumors, such as osteosarcoma (OS). 
CD155 is expressed on OS and interacts with natural killer (NK) cell receptors, 
such as activating receptor DNAM-1 and inhibitory receptors TIGIT and CD96 and 
has a dominant inhibitory effect on NK cell activity. Targeting CD155 
interactions on allogeneic NK cells could enhance anti-OS responses, but this 
has not been tested after alloBMT.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: CD155 blockade enhances allogeneic natural killer 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity against osteosarcoma and improved overall survival 
and decreased tumor growth after alloBMT in an in vivo mouse model of metastatic 
pulmonary OS. Addition of DNAM-1 blockade abrogated CD155 blockade-enhanced

Preprint.","Defining Microbial Community Functions in Chronic Human Infection with 
Metatranscriptomics.","Adekoya AE, Kargbo HA, Ibberson CB.","Chronic polymicrobial infections (cPMIs) harbor complex bacterial communities 
with diverse metabolic capacities, leading to competitive and cooperative 
interactions. Although the microbes present in cPMIs have been established 
through culture-dependent and -independent methods, the key functions that drive 
different cPMIs and the metabolic activities of these complex communities remain 
unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed 102 published 
metatranscriptomes collected from cystic fibrosis sputum (CF) and chronic wound 
infections (CW) to identify key bacterial members and functions in cPMIs. 
Community composition analysis identified a high prevalence of pathogens, 
particularly Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas , and anaerobic members of the 
microbiota, including Porphyromonas, Anaerococcus, and Prevotella . Functional 
profiling with HUMANn3 and SAMSA2 revealed that while functions involved in 
bacterial competition, oxidative stress response, and virulence were conserved 
across both chronic infection types, ≥40% of the functions were differentially 
expressed (padj < 0.05, fold-change >2). Higher expression of antibiotic 
resistance and biofilm functions were observed in CF, while tissue destructive 
enzymes and oxidative stress response functions were highly expressed in CW 
samples. Of note, strict anaerobes had negative correlations with traditional 
pathogens in both CW ( P = -0.43) and CF ( P = -0.27) samples and they 
significantly contributed to the expression of these functions. Additionally, we 
show microbial communities have unique expression patterns and distinct 
organisms fulfill the expression of key functions in each site, indicating the 
infection environment strongly influences bacterial physiology and that 
community structure influences function. Collectively, our findings indicate 
that community composition and function should guide treatment strategies for 
cPMIs.
IMPORTANCE: The microbial diversity in polymicrobial infections (PMIs) allows 
for community members to establish interactions with one another which can 
result in enhanced disease outcomes such as increased antibiotic tolerance and 
chronicity. Chronic PMIs result in large burdens on health systems, as they 
affect a significant proportion of the population and are expensive and 
difficult to treat. However, investigations into physiology of microbial 
communities in actual human infection sites is lacking. Here, we highlight that 
the predominant functions in chronic PMIs differ, and anaerobes, often described 
as contaminants, may be significant in the progression of chronic infections. 
Determining the community structure and functions in PMIs is a critical step 
towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive microbe-microbe 
interactions in these environments.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543868

considerations from Monte Carlo diffusion simulations.","Chowdhury R, Wan J, Gardier R, Rafael-Patino J, Thiran JP, Gibou F, Mukherjee A.","Aquaporins provide a new class of genetic tools for imaging molecular activity 
in deep tissues by increasing the rate of cellular water diffusion, which 
generates magnetic resonance contrast. However, distinguishing aquaporin 
contrast from the tissue background is challenging because water diffusion is 
also influenced by structural factors such as cell size and packing density. 
Here, we developed and experimentally validated a Monte Carlo model to analyze 
how cell radius and intracellular volume fraction quantitatively affect 
aquaporin signals. We demonstrated that a differential imaging approach based on 
time-dependent changes in diffusivity can improve specificity by unambiguously 
isolating aquaporin-driven contrast from the tissue background. Finally, we used 
Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the connection between diffusivity and the 
percentage of cells engineered to express aquaporin, and established a simple 
mapping that accurately determined the volume fraction of aquaporin-expressing 
cells in mixed populations. This study creates a framework for broad 
applications of aquaporins, particularly in biomedicine and in vivo synthetic 
biology, where quantitative methods to measure the location and performance of 
genetic devices in whole vertebrates are necessary.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544324

encode responses to incoming stimuli has been strongly challenged by recent 
experimental studies. Despite the fact that a large fraction of variance of 
visual responses in rodents can be attributed to behavioral state and movements, 
trial-history, and salience, the effects of contextual modulations and 
expectations on sensory-evoked responses in visual and association areas remain 
elusive. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study 
showing that hierarchically connected visual and association areas 
differentially encode the temporal context and expectation of naturalistic 
visual stimuli, consistent with the theory of hierarchical predictive coding. We 
measured neural responses to expected and unexpected sequences of natural scenes 
in the primary visual cortex (V1), the posterior medial higher order visual area 
(PM), and retrosplenial cortex (RSP) using 2-photon imaging in behaving mice 
collected through the Allen Institute Mindscope's OpenScope program. We found 
that information about image identity in neural population activity depended on 
the temporal context of transitions preceding each scene, and decreased along 
the hierarchy. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the conjunctive encoding 
of temporal context and image identity was modulated by expectations of 
sequential events. In V1 and PM, we found enhanced and specific responses to 
unexpected oddball images, signaling stimulus-specific expectation violation. In 
contrast, in RSP the population response to oddball presentation recapitulated 
the missing expected image rather than the oddball image. These differential 
responses along the hierarchy are consistent with classic theories of 
hierarchical predictive coding whereby higher areas encode predictions and lower 
areas encode deviations from expectation. We further found evidence for drift in 
visual responses on the timescale of minutes. Although activity drift was 
present in all areas, population responses in V1 and PM, but not in RSP, 
maintained stable encoding of visual information and representational geometry. 
Instead we found that RSP drift was independent of stimulus information, 
suggesting a role in generating an internal model of the environment in the 
temporal domain. Overall, our results establish temporal context and expectation 
as substantial encoding dimensions in the visual cortex subject to fast 
representational drift and suggest that hierarchically connected areas 
instantiate a predictive coding mechanism.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543483

Preprint.","Metabolic capabilities are highly conserved among human nasal-associated 
Corynebacterium species in pangenomic analyses.","Tran TH, Roberts AQ, F Escapa I, Gao W, Segre JA, Kong HH, Conlan S, Kelly MS, 
Lemon KP.","Corynebact e rium species are globally ubiquitous in human nasal microbiota 
across the lifespan. Moreover, nasal microbiota profiles typified by higher 
relative abundances of Corynebacterium are often positively associated with 
health. Among the most common human nasal Corynebacterium species are C. 
propinquum , C. pseudodiphtheriticum, C. accolens , and C. tuberculostearicum . 
Based on the prevalence of these species, at least two likely coexist in the 
nasal microbiota of 82% of adults. To gain insight into the functions of these 
four species, we identified genomic, phylogenomic, and pangenomic properties and 
estimated the functional protein repertoire and metabolic capabilities of 87 
distinct human nasal Corynebacterium strain genomes: 31 from Botswana and 56 
from the U.S. C. pseudodiphtheriticum had geographically distinct clades 
consistent with localized strain circulation, whereas some strains from the 
other species had wide geographic distribution across Africa and North America. 
All four species had similar genomic and pangenomic structures. Gene clusters 
assigned to all COG metabolic categories were overrepresented in the persistent 
(core) compared to the accessory genome of each species indicating limited 
strain-level variability in metabolic capacity. Moreover, core metabolic 
capabilities were highly conserved among the four species indicating limited 
species-level metabolic variation. Strikingly, strains in the U.S. clade of C. 
pseudodiphtheriticum lacked genes for assimilatory sulfate reduction present in 
the Botswanan clade and in the other studied species, indicating a recent, 
geographically related loss of assimilatory sulfate reduction. Overall, the 
minimal species and strain variability in metabolic capacity implies coexisting 
strains might have limited ability to occupy distinct metabolic niches.
IMPORTANCE: Pangenomic analysis with estimation of functional capabilities 
facilitates our understanding of the full biologic diversity of bacterial 
species. We performed systematic genomic, phylogenomic, and pangenomic analyses 
with qualitative estimation of the metabolic capabilities of four common human 
nasal Corynebacterium species generating a foundational resource. The prevalence 
of each species in human nasal microbiota is consistent with the common 
coexistence of at least two species. We identified a notably high level of 
metabolic conservation within and among species indicating limited options for 
species to occupy distinct metabolic niches and pointing to the importance of 
investigating interactions among nasal Corynebacterium species. Comparing 
strains from two continents, C. pseudodiphtheriticum had restricted geographic 
strain distribution characterized by an evolutionarily recent loss of 
assimilatory sulfate reduction in North American strains. Our findings 
contribute to understanding the functions of Corynebacterium within human nasal 
microbiota and to evaluating their potential for future use as biotherapeutics.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543719

has been challenging to model these diseases in iPSC-derived neurons, which 
express very low levels of 4R tau. To address this problem we have developed a 
panel of isogenic iPSC lines carrying the MAPT splice-site mutations S305S, 
S305I or S305N, derived from four different donors. All three mutations 
significantly increased the proportion of 4R tau expression in iPSC-neurons and 
astrocytes, with up to 80% 4R transcripts in S305N neurons from as early as 4 
weeks of differentiation. Transcriptomic and functional analyses of S305 mutant 
neurons revealed shared disruption in glutamate signaling and synaptic maturity, 
but divergent effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics. In iPSC-astrocytes, S305 
mutations induced lysosomal disruption and inflammation and exacerbated 
internalization of exogenous tau that may be a precursor to the glial 
pathologies observed in many tauopathies. In conclusion, we present a novel 
panel of human iPSC lines that express unprecedented levels of 4R tau in neurons

tauopathy-relevant phenotypes, but also highlight functional differences between 
the wild type 4R and mutant 4R proteins. We also highlight the functional

of lung involvement in patients with COVID-19, assess the relationship between 
lung involvement and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 
compare the performance of computer analysis with the judgment of radiological 
experts.
METHODS: A total of 81 patients from an open-source COVID database with 
confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in the study. Lung involvement was 
assessed using computed tomography (CT) scans, and the extent of infiltration 
and collapse was quantified across various lung lobes and regions. The 
associations between lung involvement and ICU admission were analyzed. 
Additionally, the computer analysis of COVID-19 involvement was compared against 
the expert rating provided by a radiological expert.
RESULTS: The results showed a higher degree of infiltration and collapse in the 
left lower lobe compared to the upper lobe (p < 0.05) and a similar pattern in 
the right lower lobes (p < 0.05). No significant difference was detected in the 
COVID-19-related involvement of the left and right lower lobes. The right middle 
lobes demonstrated lower involvement compared to the right lower lobes (p < 
0.05). When examining the regions, no significant difference in COVID-19 
involvement was found when comparing the anterior and posterior lungs. The 
middle third displayed greater COVID-19 involvement than the upper and lower 
thirds. Patients requiring ICU admission during their inpatient treatment 
exhibited significantly higher COVID-19 involvement in their lung parenchyma 
according to computer analysis, compared to patients who remained in general 
wards. Patients with more than 40% COVID-19 involvement were almost exclusively 
treated in intensive care. A high correlation was observed between computer 
detection of COVID-19 affections and expert rating by a radiological expert.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the extent of lung involvement, 
particularly in the lower lobes and middle third, may be associated with the 
need for ICU admission in patients with COVID-19. Computer analysis showed a 
high correlation with expert rating, highlighting its potential utility in 
clinical settings for assessing lung involvement. This information may help 
guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation during ongoing or future 
pandemics. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate

Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) compared to the civilian population with no 
care model that consistently improves Veteran outcomes when scaled. COPD 
Coordinated Access to Reduce Exacerbations (CARE) is a care bundle intended to 
improve the delivery of evidence-based practices to Veterans. To address 
challenges to scaling this program in the Veterans' Health Administration (VA), 
the COPD CARE Academy (Academy), an implementation facilitation package 
comprised of four implementation strategies was designed and implemented. 
Methods This evaluation utilized a mixed-methods approach to assess the impact 
of the Academy's implementation strategies on the RE-AIM framework 
implementation outcomes and the extent to which they were effective at 
increasing clinicians' perceived capability to implement COPD CARE. A survey was 
administered one week after Academy participation and a semi-structured 
interview conducted eight to 12 months later. Descriptive statistics were 
calculated for quantitative items and thematic analysis was used to analyze 
open-ended items. Results Thirty-six clinicians from 13 VA medical centers 
(VAMCs) participated in the Academy in 2020 and 2021 and 264 front-line 
clinicians completed COPD CARE training. Adoption of the Academy was indicated 
by high rates of Academy completion (97%), session attendance (90%), and high 
utilization of Academy resources. Clinicians reported the Academy to be 
acceptable and appropriate as an implementation package and clinicians from 92% 
of VAMCs reported long-term utilization of Academy resources. Effectiveness of 
the Academy was represented by clinicians' significant increases (p < 0.05) in 
their capability to complete ten implementation tasks after Academy 
participation. Conclusions This evaluation found that the use of implementation 
facilitation paired with additional strategies seemed to demonstrate positive 
implementation outcomes across all RE-AIM domains and identified areas for 
potential improvement. Future assessments are needed to explore post-academy 
resources that would help VAMCs to strategize localized approaches to overcome

correlate with worse prognosis. Harnessing macrophages for therapeutic purposes 
has been particularly challenging due to their heterogeneity, based on their 
ontogeny and function and driven by the tissue-specific niche. In the present 
study, we used the YUMM1.7 model to better understand melanoma TAM origin and 
dynamics during tumor progression, with potential therapeutic implications. We 
identified distinct TAM subsets based on F4/80 expression, with the F4/80 high 
fraction increasing over time and displaying tissue-resident-like phenotype. 
While skin-resident macrophages showed mixed on-togeny, F4/80 + TAM subsets in

Mul-tiparametric analysis of macrophage phenotype showed a temporal divergence 
of F4/80 + TAM subpopulations, which also differed from skin-resident subsets,

co-ex-pression of M1- and M2-like canonical markers, while RNA-seq and pathway 
analysis showed differential immunosup-pressive and metabolic profiles. GSEA 
showed F4/80 high TAMs to rely on oxidative phosphorylation, with increased 
proliferation and protein secretion while F4/80 low cells had high 
pro-inflammatory and intracellular signaling pathways, with lipid and polyamine 
metabolism. Overall, the present in-depth characterization provides further

particular interest because of their requirement for dephosphorylating the 
natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) guanylyl cyclase, which triggers oocyte 
meiotic resumption. Among the PPP family regulatory subunits, PPP1R12A and 
PPP2R5D showed the largest increases in phosphorylation, with 4-10 fold 
increases in signal intensity on several sites. Although follicles from mice in 
which these phosphorylations were prevented by serine-to-alanine mutations in 
either Ppp1r12a or Ppp2r5d showed normal LH-induced NPR2 dephosphorylation, 
these regulatory subunits and others could act redundantly to dephosphorylate 
NPR2. Our identification of phosphatases and other proteins whose 
phosphorylation state is rapidly modified by LH provides clues about multiple 
signaling pathways in ovarian follicles.
SUMMARY SENTENCE: Mass spectrometric analysis of phosphatases whose 
phosphorylation state is rapidly modified by luteinizing hormone provides clues 
about how LH signaling dephosphorylates NPR2 as well as a resource for future 
studies.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.544636

Preprint.","Fundamental role for the creatine kinase pathway in protection from murine 
colitis.","Hall CH, Lanis JM, Dowdell AS, Murphy EM, Colgan SP.","Inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract, including inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), cause metabolic stress within mucosal tissue. Creatine is a key 
energetic regulator. We previously reported a loss of creatine kinases (CKs) and 
the creatine transporter expression in IBD patient intestinal biopsy samples and 
that creatine supplementation was protective in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) 
colitis mouse model. In the present studies, we evaluated the role of CK loss in 
active inflammation using the DSS colitis model. Mice lacking expression of 
CKB/CKMit (CKdKO) showed increased susceptibility to DSS colitis (weight loss, 
disease activity, permeability, colon length and histology). In a broad cytokine 
profiling, CKdKO mice expressed near absent IFN-γ levels. We identified losses 
in IFN-γ production from CD4 + and CD8 + T cells isolated from CKdKO mice. 
Addback of IFN-γ during DSS treatment resulted in partial protection for CKdKO 
mice. We identified basal stabilization of the transcription factor 
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in CKdKO splenocytes and pharmacological 
stabilization of HIF resulted in reduced IFN-γ production by control 
splenocytes. Thus, the loss of IFN-γ production by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in 
CKdKO mice resulted in increased colitis susceptibility and indicates that CK is 
protective in active mucosal inflammation.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544110

Preprint.","Evaluation of abstract rule-based associations in the human premotor cortex 
during passive observation.","Gharesi N, Luneau L, Kalaska JF, Baillet S.","Decision-making often manifests in behavior, typically yielding overt motor 
actions. This complex process requires the registration of sensory information 
with one's internal representation of the current context, before a categorical 
judgment of the most appropriate motor behavior can be issued. The construct 
concept of embodied decision-making encapsulates this sequence of complex 
processes, whereby behaviorally salient information from the environment is 
represented in an abstracted space of potential motor actions rather than only 
in an abstract cognitive ""decision"" space. Theoretical foundations and some 
empirical evidence account for support the involvement of premotor cortical 
circuits in embodied cognitive functions. Animal models show that premotor 
circuits participate in the registration and evaluation of actions performed by 
peers in social situations, that is, prior to controlling one's voluntary 
movements guided by arbitrary stimulus-response rules. However, such evidence 
from human data is currently limited. Here we used time-resolved 
magnetoencephalography imaging to characterize activations of the premotor 
cortex as human participants observed arbitrary, non-biological visual stimuli 
that either respected or violated a simple stimulus-response association rule. 
The participants had learned this rule previously, either actively, by 
performing a motor task (active learning), or passively, by observing a computer 
perform the same task (passive learning). We discovered that the human premotor 
cortex is activated during the passive observation of the correct execution of a 
sequence of events according to a rule learned previously. Premotor activation 
also differs when the subjects observe incorrect stimulus sequences. These 
premotor effects are present even when the observed events are of a non-motor, 
abstract nature, and even when the stimulus-response association rule was 
learned via passive observations of a computer agent performing the task, 
without requiring overt motor actions from the human participant. We found 
evidence of these phenomena by tracking cortical beta-band signaling in temporal 
alignment with the observation of task events and behavior. We conclude that 
premotor cortical circuits that are typically engaged during voluntary motor 
behavior are also involved in the interpretation of events of a non-ecological, 
unfamiliar nature but related to a learned abstract rule. As such, the present 
study provides the first evidence of neurophysiological processes of embodied 
decision-making in human premotor circuits when the observed events do not 
involve motor actions of a third party.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543581

this study, we used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging and artificial

Preprint.",Evaluation of haplotype-aware long-read error correction with hifieval.,"Guo Y, Feng X, Li H.","SUMMARY: The PacBio High-Fidelity (HiFi) sequencing technology produces long 
reads of > 99% in accuracy. It has enabled the development of a new generation 
of de novo sequence assemblers, which all have sequencing error correction as 
the first step. As HiFi is a new data type, this critical step has not been 
evaluated before. Here, we introduced hifieval, a new command-line tool for 
measuring over- and under-corrections produced by error correction algorithms. 
We assessed the accuracy of the error correction components of existing HiFi 
assemblers on the CHM13 and the HG002 datasets and further investigated the 
performance of error correction methods in challenging regions such as 
homopolymer regions, centromeric regions, and segmental duplications. Hifieval 
will help HiFi assemblers to improve error correction and assembly quality in 
the long run.

tuberculosis (TB), establishes residence and grows in human alveolar macrophages 
(AMs). Inter-individual variation in M.tb -human AM interactions can indicate TB 
risk and the efficacy of therapies and vaccines; however, we currently lack an 
understanding of the gene and protein expression programs that dictate this 
variation in the lungs. Results: Herein, we systematically analyze interactions 
of a virulent M.tb strain H 37 R v with freshly isolated human AMs from 28 
healthy adult donors, measuring host RNA expression and secreted candidate 
proteins associated with TB pathogenesis over 72h. A large set of genes 
possessing highly variable inter-individual expression levels are differentially 
expressed in response to M.tb infection . Eigengene modules link M.tb growth 
rate with host transcriptional and protein profiles at 24 and 72h. Systems 
analysis of differential RNA and protein expression identifies a robust network 
with IL1B , STAT1 , and IDO1 as hub genes associated with M.tb growth. RNA time 
profiles document stimulation towards an M1-type macrophage gene expression 
followed by emergence of an M2-type profile. Finally, we replicate these results 
in a cohort from a TB-endemic region, finding a substantial portion of 
significant differentially expressed genes overlapping between studies. 
Conclusions: We observe large inter-individual differences in bacterial uptake 
and growth, with tenfold variation in M.tb load by 72h.The fine-scale resolution 
of this work enables the identification of genes and gene networks associated 
with early M.tb growth dynamics in defined donor clusters, an important step in 
developing potential biological indicators of individual susceptibility to M.tb

Preprint.","Aspergillus fumigatus cytochrome c impacts conidial survival during sterilizing 
immunity.","James MR, Aufiero MA, Vesely EM, Dhingra S, Liu KW, Hohl TM, Cramer RA.","Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a life-threatening infection caused by 
species in the ubiquitous fungal genus Aspergillus . While leukocyte-generated 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for the clearance of fungal conidia 
from the lung and resistance to IPA, the processes that govern ROS-dependent 
fungal cell death remain poorly defined. Using a flow cytometric approach that 
monitors two independent cell death markers, an endogenous histone H2A:mRFP 
nuclear integrity reporter and Sytox Blue cell impermeable (live/dead) stain, we 
observed that loss of A. fumigatus cytochrome c ( cycA ) results in reduced 
susceptibility to cell death from hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) treatment. 
Consistent with these observations in vitro , loss of cycA confers resistance to 
both NADPH-oxidase -dependent and -independent killing by host leukocytes. 
Fungal ROS resistance is partly mediated in part by Bir1, a homolog to survivin 
in humans, as Bir1 overexpression results in decreased ROS-induced conidial cell 
death and reduced killing by innate immune cells in vivo . We further report 
that overexpression of the Bir1 N-terminal BIR domain in A. fumigatus conidia 
results in altered expression of metabolic genes that functionally converge on 
mitochondrial function and cytochrome c ( cycA ) activity. Together, these 
studies demonstrate that cycA in A. fumigatus contributes to cell death 
responses that are induced by exogenous H 2 O 2 and by host leukocytes.
IMPORTANCE: Aspergillus fumigatus can cause a life-threatening infection known 
as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which is marked by 
fungus-attributable mortality rates of 20%-30%. Individuals at risk of IPA 
harbor genetic mutations or incur pharmacologic defects that impair myeloid cell 
numbers and/or function, exemplified by bone marrow transplant recipients, 
patients that receive corticosteroid therapy, or patients with Chronic 
Granulomatous Disease (CGD). However, treatments for Aspergillus infections 
remains limited, and resistance to the few existing drug classes is emerging. 
Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified A. fumigatus as a 
critical priority fungal pathogen. Our research identifies an important aspect 
of fungal biology that impacts susceptibility to leukocyte killing. Furthering 
our understanding of mechanisms that mediate the outcome of fungal-leukocyte 
interactions will increase our understanding of both the underlying fungal 
biology governing cell death and innate immune evasion strategies utilized 
during mammalian infection pathogenesis. Consequently, our studies are a 
critical step toward leveraging these mechanisms for novel therapeutic advances.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544103

Preprint.","Neuron Enriched Exosomal MicroRNA Expression Profiles as a Marker of Early Life 
Alcohol Consumption.","Yakovlev V, Lapato DM, Rana P, Ghosh P, Frye R, Roberson-Nay R.","BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption may impact and shape brain development through 
perturbed biological pathways and impaired molecular functions. We investigated 
the relationship between alcohol consumption rates and neuron-enriched exosomal 
microRNA (miRNA) expression to better understand the impact of alcohol use on 
early life brain biology.
METHODS: Neuron-enriched exosomal miRNA expression was measured from plasma 
samples collected from young people using a commercially available microarray 
platform while alcohol consumption was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders 
Identification Test. Linear regression and network analyses were used to 
identify significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and to characterize the 
implicated biological pathways, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared to alcohol naïve controls, young people reporting high alcohol 
consumption exhibited significantly higher expression of four neuron-enriched 
exosomal miRNAs including miR-30a-5p, miR-194-5p, and miR-339-3p, although only 
miR-30a-5p and miR-194-5p survived multiple test correction. The miRNA-miRNA 
interaction network inferred by a network inference algorithm did not detect any 
differentially expressed miRNAs with a high cutoff on edge scores. However, when 
the cutoff of the algorithm was reduced, five miRNAs were identified as 
interacting with miR-194-5p and miR-30a-5p. These seven miRNAs were associated 
with 25 biological functions; miR-194-5p was the most highly connected node and 
was highly correlated with the other miRNAs in this cluster.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observed association between neuron-enriched exosomal miRNAs 
and alcohol consumption concurs with results from experimental animal models of 
alcohol use and suggests that high rates of alcohol consumption during the 
adolescent/young adult years may impact brain functioning and development by 
modulating miRNA expression.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544235

to improve healthcare delivery and health outcomes. Communicating results and 
health education via text may facilitate program planning and promote better 
engagement in care for women undergoing human papillomavirus (HPV) screening. We 
sought to develop and evaluate an mHealth strategy with enhanced text messaging 
to improve follow-up throughout the cervical cancer screening cascade. Methods 
Women aged 25-65 participated in HPV testing in six community health campaigns 
(CHCs) in western Kenya. Women received their HPV results via text message, 
phone call, or home visit. Those who opted for text in the first four 
communities received ""standard"" texts. After completing the fourth CHC, we 
conducted two focus group discussions with women to develop an ""enhanced"" text 
strategy, including modifying the content, number, and timing of texts, for the 
subsequent two communities. We compared the overall receipt of results and 
follow-up for treatment evaluation among women in standard and enhanced text 
groups. Results Among 2,368 women who were screened in the first four 
communities, 566 (23.9%) received results via text, 1,170 (49.4%) via phone 
call, and 632 (26.7%) via home visit. In the communities where enhanced text 
notification was offered, 264 of the 935 screened women (28.2%) opted for text, 
474 (51.2%) opted for phone call, and 192 (20.5%) for home visit. Among 555 
women (16.8%) who tested HPV-positive, 257 (46.3%) accessed treatment, with no 
difference in treatment uptake between the standard text group (48/90, 53.3%) 
and the enhanced text group (22/41, 53.7%). More women in the enhanced text 
group had prior cervical cancer screening (25.8% vs. 18.4%; p < 0.05) and 
reported living with HIV (32.6% vs. 20.2%; p < 0.001) than those in the standard 
text group. Conclusions Modifying the content and number of texts as an enhanced 
text messaging strategy was not sufficient to increase follow-up in an HPV-based 
cervical cancer screening program in western Kenya. A one-size approach to 
mHealth delivery does not meet the needs of all women in this region. More 
comprehensive programs are needed to improve linkage to care to further reduce 
structural and logistical barriers to cervical cancer treatment.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2828978/v1

Fischer RL, Choi Y.","Background H2A.X is an H2A variant histone in eukaryotes, unique for its ability 
to respond to DNA damage, initiating the DNA repair pathway. H2A.X replacement 
within the histone octamer is mediated by the FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions 
(FACT) complex, a key chromatin remodeler. FACT is required for DEMETER 
(DME)-mediated DNA demethylation at certain loci in Arabidopsis thaliana female 
gametophytes during reproduction. Here, we sought to investigate whether H2A.X 
is involved in DME- and FACT-mediated DNA demethylation during reproduction. 
Results H2A.X is encoded by two genes in Arabidopsis genome, HTA3 and HTA5 . We 
generated h2a.x double mutants, which displayed a normal growth profile, whereby 
flowering time, seed development, and root tip organization, S-phase progression 
and proliferation were all normal. However, h2a.x mutants were more sensitive to 
genotoxic stress, consistent with previous reports. H2A.X fused to Green 
Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under the H2A.X promoter was highly expressed 
especially in newly developing Arabidopsis tissues, including in male and female 
gametophytes, where DME is also expressed. We examined DNA methylation in h2a.x 
developing seeds and seedlings using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and 
found that CG DNA methylation is decreased genome-wide in h2a.x mutant seeds. 
Hypomethylation was most striking in transposon bodies, and occurred on both 
parental alleles in the developing endosperm, but not the embryo or seedling. 
h2a.x -mediated hypomethylated sites overlapped DME targets, but also included 
other loci, predominately located in heterochromatic transposons and intergenic 
DNA. Conclusions Our genome-wide methylation analyses suggest that H2A.X could 
function in preventing access of the DME demethylase to non-canonical sites. 
Alternatively, H2A.X may be involved in recruiting methyltransferases to those 
sites. Overall, our data suggest that H2A.X is required to maintain DNA 
methylation homeostasis in the unique chromatin environment of the Arabidopsis 
endosperm.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2974671/v1

Reisz JA, D'Alessandro A, Tennessen JM.","Pyruvate kinase (Pyk) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the final 
metabolic reaction in glycolysis. The importance of this enzyme, however, 
extends far beyond ATP production, as Pyk is also known to regulate tissue 
growth, cell proliferation, and development. Studies of this enzyme in 
Drosophila melanogaster , however, are complicated by the fact that the fly 
genome encodes six Pyk paralogs whose functions remain poorly defined. To 
address this issue, we used sequence distance and phylogenetic approaches to 
demonstrate that the gene Pyk encodes the enzyme most similar to the mammalian 
Pyk orthologs, while the other five Drosophila Pyk paralogs have significantly 
diverged from the canonical enzyme. Consistent with this observation, 
metabolomic studies of two different Pyk mutant backgrounds revealed that larvae 
lacking Pyk exhibit a severe block in glycolysis, with a buildup of glycolytic 
intermediates upstream of pyruvate. However, our analysis also unexpectedly 
reveals that steady state pyruvate levels are unchanged in Pyk mutants, 
indicating that larval metabolism maintains pyruvate pool size despite severe 
metabolic limitations. Consistent with our metabolomic findings, a complementary 
RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes involved in lipid metabolism and peptidase 
activity are elevated in Pyk mutants, again indicating that loss of this 
glycolytic enzyme induces compensatory changes in other aspects of metabolism. 
Overall, our study provides both insight into how Drosophila larval metabolism 
adapts to disruption of glycolytic metabolism as well as immediate clinical 
relevance, considering that Pyk deficiency is the most common congenital 
enzymatic defect in humans.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543743

neurobiological underpinnings remain unclear. In particular, relationship 
between FTD symptom dimensions and patterns of regional brain volume 
deficiencies in schizophrenia remain to be established in large cohorts. Even 
less is known about the cellular basis of FTD. Our study addresses these major 
obstacles based on a large multi-site cohort through the ENIGMA Schizophrenia 
Working Group (752 individuals with schizophrenia and 1256 controls), to unravel 
the neuroanatomy of positive, negative and total FTD in schizophrenia and their 
cellular bases. We used virtual histology tools to relate brain structural 
changes associated with FTD to cellular distributions in cortical regions. We 
identified distinct neural networks for positive and negative FTD. Both networks 
encompassed fronto-occipito-amygdalar brain regions, but negative FTD showed a 
relative sparing of orbitofrontal cortical thickness, while positive FTD also 
affected lateral temporal cortices. Virtual histology identified distinct 
transcriptomic fingerprints associated for both symptom dimensions. Negative FTD 
was linked to neuronal and astrocyte fingerprints, while positive FTD was also 
linked to microglial cell types. These findings relate different dimensions of 
FTD to distinct brain structural changes and their cellular underpinnings, 
improve our mechanistic understanding of these key psychotic symptoms.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.23291034

Preprint.","Activation of Multiple Eph Receptors on Neuronal Membranes Correlates with The 
Onset of Traumatic Optic Neuropathy.","Strong TA, Esquivel J, Wang Q, Ledon PJ, Wang H, Gaidosh G, Tse D, Pelaez D.","BACKGROUND: Optic neuropathy (ON) is a major cause of irreversible blindness, 
yet the molecular determinants that contribute to neuronal demise have not been 
fully elucidated. Several studies have identified 'ephrin signaling' as one of 
the most dysregulated pathways in the early pathophysiology of ON with varied 
etiologies. Developmentally, gradients in ephrin signaling coordinate 
retinotopic mapping via repulsive modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in 
neuronal membranes. Little is known about the role ephrin signaling played in 
the post-natal visual system and its correlation with the onset of optic 
neuropathy.
METHODS: Postnatal mouse retinas were collected for mass spectrometry analysis 
for Eph receptors. Optic nerve crush (ONC) model was employed to induce optic 
neuropathy, and proteomic changes during the acute phase of neuropathic onset 
were analyzed. Confocal and super-resolution microscopy determined the cellular 
localization of activated Eph receptors after ONC injury. Eph receptor 
inhibitors assessed the neuroprotective effect of ephrin signaling modulation.
RESULTS: Mass spectrometry revealed expression of seven Eph receptors (EphA2, 
A4, A5, B1, B2, B3, and B6) in postnatal mouse retinal tissue. Immunoblotting 
analysis indicated a significant increase in phosphorylation of these Eph 
receptors 48 hours after ONC. Confocal microscopy demonstrated the presence of 
both subclasses of Eph receptors in the inner retinal layers. STORM 
super-resolution imaging combined with optimal transport colocalization analysis 
revealed a significant co-localization of activated Eph receptors with injured 
neuronal processes, compared to uninjured neuronal and/or injured glial cells, 
48 hours post-ONC. Eph receptor inhibitors displayed notable neuroprotective 
effects after 6 days of ONC injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the functional presence of diverse Eph 
receptors in the postnatal mammalian retina, capable of modulating multiple 
biological processes. Pan-Eph receptor activation contributes to the onset of 
neuropathy in ONs, with preferential activation of Eph receptors on neuronal 
processes in the inner retina following optic nerve injury. Notably, Eph 
receptor activation precedes neuronal loss. We observed neuroprotective effects 
upon inhibiting Eph receptors. Our study highlights the importance of 
investigating this repulsive pathway in early optic neuropathies and provides a 
comprehensive characterization of the receptors present in the developed retina 
of mice, relevant to both homeostasis and disease processes.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543735

Thota PN, Aklog L, Willis JE, Markowitz SD, Chak A.","BACKGROUND: We previously reported an encapsulated balloon (EsoCheck TM , EC), 
which selectively samples the distal esophagus, that coupled with a two 
methylated DNA biomarker panel (EsoGuard TM , EG), detected Barrett's esophagus 
(BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), with a sensitivity and specificity of 
90.3% and 91.7%, respectively. This previous study utilized frozen EC samples.
AIM: To assess a next generation EC sampling device and EG assay that utilizes a 
room temperature sample preservative to enable office-based testing.
METHODS: Cases with nondysplastic (ND) and dysplastic (indefinite=IND, low grade 
dysplasia = LGD, high grade dysplasia = HGD) BE, EAC, junctional adenocarcinoma 
(JAC) and controls with no intestinal metaplasia (IM) were included. Nurses or 
physician assistants at six institutions, who were trained in EC administration, 
delivered the encapsulated balloon per orally and inflated it in the stomach. 
The inflated balloon was pulled back to sample 5 cm of the distal esophagus, 
then deflated and retracted into the EC capsule to prevent sample contamination 
from proximal esophagus. Nextgen EG sequencing assays performed on 
bisulfite-treated DNA extracted from EC samples determined levels of methylated 
Vimentin (mVIM) and methylated Cyclin A1 (mCCNA1) in a CLIA-certified 
laboratory, blinded to patients' phenotypes.
RESULTS: A total of 242 evaluable patients - 88 cases (median age 68 years, 78% 
men, 92% white) and 154 controls (median age 58 years, 40% men, 88% white) - 
underwent adequate EC sampling. Mean time for EC sampling was just over 3 
minutes. The cases included 31 NDBE, 17 IND/LGD, 22 HGD, and 18 EAC/JAC. 
Thirty-seven (53%) of the non-dysplastic and dysplastic BE cases were 
short-segment BE (SSBE; < 3 cm). Overall sensitivity for detecting all cases was 
85% (95% CI= 0.76-0.91) and specificity was 84% (95% CI=0.77-0.89). Sensitivity 
for SSBE was 76% (n=37). The EC/EG test detected 100% of cancers.
CONCLUSION: The next-generation EC/EG technology has been both successfully 
updated to incorporate a room temperature sample collection preservative and 
successfully implemented in a CLIA certified laboratory. When performed by 
trained personnel, EC/EG detects non-dysplastic BE, dysplastic BE, and cancer 
with high sensitivity and specificity, replicating the operating characteristics 
of the initial pilot study of this technology. Future applications utilizing 
EC/EG to screen broader populations at risk for developing cancer are proposed.
SIGNIFICANCE: This multi-center study demonstrates the successful performance of 
a commercially available clinically implementable non-endoscopic screening test 
for BE in the U.S., as recommended in the most recent ACG Guideline and AGA 
Clinical Update. It transitions and validates a prior academic laboratory-based 
study of frozen research samples over to a CLIA laboratory, one that also 
integrates a clinically practical room temperature method for sample acquisition 
and storage, enabling office-based screening.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.23291048

expectations to infer perceptual objects. Despite the centrality of this process 
to perception, the neural mechanism of sensory inference is not known. Illusory 
contours (ICs) are key tools to study sensory inference because they contain 
edges or objects that are implied only by their spatial context. Using cellular 
resolution, mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging and multi-Neuropixels 
recordings in the mouse visual cortex, we identified a sparse subset of neurons 
in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond 
emergently to ICs. We found that these highly selective 'IC-encoders' mediate 
the neural representation of IC inference. Strikingly, selective activation of 
these neurons using two-photon holographic optogenetics was sufficient to 
recreate IC representation in the rest of the V1 network, in the absence of any 
visual stimulus. This outlines a model in which primary sensory cortex 
facilitates sensory inference by selectively strengthening input patterns that 
match prior expectations through local, recurrent circuitry. Our data thus 
suggest a clear computational purpose for recurrence in the generation of 
holistic percepts under sensory ambiguity. More generally, selective 
reinforcement of top-down predictions by pattern-completing recurrent circuits 
in lower sensory cortices may constitute a key step in sensory inference.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543698

wastewater-based epidemiology.","Phan T, Brozak S, Pell B, Ciupe SM, Ke R, Ribeiro RM, Gitter A, Mena KD, 
Perelson AS, Kuang Y, Wu F.","Wastewater surveillance has been widely used to track and estimate SARS-CoV-2 
incidence. While both infectious and recovered individuals shed virus into 
wastewater, epidemiological inferences using wastewater often only consider the 
viral contribution from the former group. Yet, the persistent shedding in the 
latter group could confound wastewater-based epidemiological inference, 
especially during the late stage of an outbreak when the recovered population 
outnumbers the infectious population. To determine the impact of recovered 
individuals' viral shedding on the utility of wastewater surveillance, we 
develop a quantitative framework that incorporates population-level viral 
shedding dynamics, measured viral RNA in wastewater, and an epidemic dynamic 
model. We find that the viral shedding from the recovered population can become 
higher than the infectious population after the transmission peak, which leads 
to a decrease in the correlation between wastewater viral RNA and case report 
data. Furthermore, the inclusion of recovered individuals' viral shedding into 
the model predicts earlier transmission dynamics and slower decreasing trends in 
wastewater viral RNA. The prolonged viral shedding also induces a potential 
delay in the detection of new variants due to the time needed to generate enough 
new cases for a significant viral signal in an environment dominated by virus 
shed by the recovered population. This effect is most prominent toward the end 
of an outbreak and is greatly affected by both the recovered individuals' 
shedding rate and shedding duration. Our results suggest that the inclusion of 
viral shedding from non-infectious recovered individuals into wastewater 
surveillance research is important for precision epidemiology.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.23291144

combinations of physiological elements and their interactions in behaving 
animals. Here we developed a thermal tapering process (TTP) which enables the 
fabrication of novel, low-cost, flexible probes that combine ultrafine features 
of dense electrodes, optical waveguides, and microfluidic channels. Furthermore, 
we developed a semi-automated backend connection allowing scalable assembly of 
the probes. We demonstrate that our T-DOpE ( T apered D rug delivery, Op tical 
stimulation, and E lectrophysiology) probe achieves in a single neuron-scale 
device (1) high-fidelity electrophysiological recording (2) focal drug delivery 
and (3) optical stimulation. With a tapered geometry, the device tip can be 
minimized (as small as 50 μm) to ensure minimal tissue damage while the backend 
is ~20 times larger allowing for direct integration with industrial-scale 
connectorization. Acute and chronic implantation of the probes in mouse 
hippocampus CA1 revealed canonical neuronal activity at the level of local field 
potentials and spiking. Taking advantage of the triple-functionality of the 
T-DOpE probe, we monitored local field potentials with simultaneous manipulation 
of endogenous type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R; via microfluidic agonist 
delivery) and CA1 pyramidal cell membrane potential (optogenetic activation). 
Electro-pharmacological experiments revealed that focal infusion of CB1R agonist 
CP-55,940 in dorsal CA1 downregulated theta and sharp wave-ripple oscillations. 
Furthermore, using the full electro-pharmacological-optical feature set of the

by impairing the innate SPW-R-generating ability of the CA1 circuit.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544251

associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and atherosclerosis. However, 
little is known about the relationship of 2-AAA to other cardiometabolic risk

measured circulating 2-AAA using two methods in 1) a sample of 261 healthy 
individuals (2-AAA Study), and 2) in a sample of 134 persons comprising 110 
individuals with treated HIV, with or without T2D, a population at high risk of 
metabolic disease and cardiovascular events despite suppression of circulating

lower urinary tract symptoms (pLUTS) in a US privately-insured pediatric 
population who are 18 years of age or older by age, sex, race/ethnicity from 
2003-2014. This has not been previously described in the literature.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Optum's de-identifed Clinformatics® Data 
Mart Database database between 2003-2014. A pLUTS patient was defined by the 
presence of ≥ 1 pLUTS-related ICD-9 diagnosis code between the age of 6-20 
years. Neurogenic bladder, renal transplant and structural urologic disease 
diagnoses were excluded. Prevalence by year was calculated as a proportion of 
pLUTS patients among the total population at risk. Variables reviewed included 
age, sex, race, geographic region, household factors and clinical comorbidities 
including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), constipation, and 
sleep apnea. Point of service (POS) was calculated as a proportion of 
pLUTS-related claims associated with a POS compared to the total claims at all 
POS in the time period.
RESULTS: We identified 282,427 unique patients with ≥ 1 claim for pLUTS between 
the ages of 6-20 years from 2003-2014. Average prevalence during this period was 
0.92%, increasing from 0.63% in 2003 to 1.13% in 2014. Mean age was 12.15 years. 
More patients were female (59.80%), white (65.97%), between 6-10 years old 
(52.18%) and resided in the Southern US (44.97%). Within a single household, 
81.71% reported ≤ 2 children, and 65.53% reported ≥ 3 adults. 16.88% had a 
diagnosis of ADHD, 19.49% had a diagnosis of constipation and 3.04% had a 
diagnosis of sleep apnea. 75% of pLUTS-related claims were recorded in an 
outpatient setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Families consistently seek medical care in the outpatient setting 
for pLUTS. The demographic and clinical characteristics of our cohort reflect

Preprint.","A Spatiotemporal Compartmentalization of Glucose Metabolism Guides Mammalian 
Gastrulation Progression.","Cao D, Zhong L, Hemalatha A, Bergmann J, Cox AL, Greco V, Sozen B.","Gastrulation is considered the sine qua non of embryogenesis, establishing a 
multidimensional structure and the spatial coordinates upon which all later 
developmental events transpire. At this time, the embryo adopts a heavy reliance 
on glucose metabolism to support rapidly accelerating changes in morphology, 
proliferation, and differentiation. However, it is currently unknown how this 
conserved metabolic shift maps onto the three-dimensional landscape of the 
growing embryo and whether it is spatially linked to the orchestrated cellular 
and molecular processes necessary for gastrulation. Here we identify that 
glucose is utilised during mouse gastrulation via distinct metabolic pathways to 
instruct local and global embryonic morphogenesis, in a cell type and 
stage-specific manner. Through detailed mechanistic studies and quantitative 
live imaging of mouse embryos, in parallel with tractable in vitro stem cell 
differentiation models and embryo-derived tissue explants, we discover that cell 
fate acquisition and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) relies on 
the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) branch of glucose metabolism, while 
newly-formed mesoderm requires glycolysis for correct migration and lateral 
expansion. This regional and tissue-specific difference in glucose metabolism is 
coordinated with Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) activity, demonstrating that 
reciprocal crosstalk between metabolism and growth factor signalling is a 
prerequisite for gastrulation progression. We expect these studies to provide 
important insights into the function of metabolism in other developmental 
contexts and may help uncover mechanisms that underpin embryonic lethality, 
cancer, and congenital disease.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543780

impact progression of BC CNS metastasis to BC-LMD, and which factors affect OS 
for patients with BC-LMD Methods Patients with BC and brain/spinal metastatic 
disease were identified. For those who eventually developed BC-LMD, we used 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve, log-rank test, univariable, and multivariate Cox

Complex is Position Dependent and Regulated.","Kyrchanova O, Ibragimov A, Postika N, Georgiev P, Schedl P.","Expression of Abdominal-B ( Abd-B ) in abdominal segments A5 - A8 is controlled 
by four regulatory domains, iab-5 - iab-8 . Each domain has an initiator element 
(which sets the activity state), elements that maintain this state and 
tissue-specific enhancers. To ensure their functional autonomy, each domain is 
bracketed by boundary elements ( Mcp , Fab-7 , Fab-7 and Fab-8 ). In addition to 
blocking crosstalk between adjacent regulatory domains, the Fab boundaries must 
also have bypass activity so the relevant regulatory domains can ""jump over"" 
intervening boundaries and activate the Abd-B promoter. In the studies reported 
here we have investigated the parameters governing bypass activity. We find that 
the bypass elements in the Fab-7 and Fab-8 boundaries must be located in the 
regulatory domain that is responsible for driving Abd-B expression. We suggest 
that bypass activity may also be subject to regulation.

Preprint.","Association of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States, 
2022-2023.","Packard SE, Susser E.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the association of Long COVID with housing insecurity in 
the United States.
METHODS: To compare the prevalence of 3 binary indicators of housing insecurity 
between people with Long COVID (symptoms > 3 months) and COVID-19 survivors who 
don't report long-term symptoms, we used survey-weighted regression models on 
203,807 responses from the Household Pulse Survey, a representative survey of US 
households collected September 2022 - April 2023. Among people with Long COVID, 
we assessed whether functional impairment, current COVID-19 related symptoms, 
and symptom impact on day-to-day life were associated with a higher prevalence 
of housing insecurity.
RESULTS: During the study period, 54,446 (27.2%) respondents with COVID-19 
experienced symptoms lasting 3 months or longer, representing an estimated 27 
million US adults. People with Long COVID were nearly twice as likely to 
experience significant difficulty with household expenses (Prevalence ratio [PR] 
1.85, 95% CI 1.74-1.96), be behind on housing payments (PR 1.76, 95% CI 
1.57-1.99), and face likely eviction or foreclosure (PR 2.12, 95% CI 1.58-2.86). 
Functional limitation and current symptoms which impact day-to-day life were 
associated with higher prevalence of housing insecurity.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with COVID-19 survivors who don't experience long-term 
symptoms, people with Long COVID are more likely to report indicators housing 
insecurity, particularly those with functional limitations and long-term 
COVID-19 related symptoms impacting day-to-day life. Policies are needed to 
support people living with chronic illnesses following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290930

Preprint.",Quantile Regression for biomarkers in the UK Biobank.,"Wang C, Wang T, Wei Y, Aschard H, Ionita-Laza I.","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for biomarkers important for clinical 
phenotypes can lead to clinically relevant discoveries. GWAS for quantitative 
traits are based on simplified regression models modeling the conditional mean 
of a phenotype as a linear function of genotype. An alternative and easy to 
apply approach is quantile regression that naturally extends linear regression 
to the analysis of the entire conditional distribution of a phenotype of 
interest by modeling conditional quantiles within a regression framework. 
Quantile regression can be applied efficiently at biobank scale using standard 
statistical packages in much the same way as linear regression, while having 
some unique advantages such as identifying variants with heterogeneous effects 
across different quantiles, including non-additive effects and variants involved 
in gene-environment interactions; accommodating a wide range of phenotype 
distributions with invariance to trait transformation; and overall providing 
more detailed information about the underlying genotype-phenotype associations. 
Here, we demonstrate the value of quantile regression in the context of GWAS by 
applying it to 39 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank ( n > 300, 000 
individuals). Across these 39 traits we identify 7,297 significant loci, 
including 259 loci only detected by quantile regression. We show that quantile 
regression can help uncover replicable but unmodelled gene-environment 
interactions, and can provide additional key insights into poorly understood 
genotype-phenotype correlations for clinically relevant biomarkers at minimal 
additional cost.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543699

LA, Yarger HA, Redcay E.","A core feature of autism is difficulties with social interaction. Atypical 
social motivation is proposed to underlie these difficulties. However, prior 
work testing this hypothesis has shown mixed support and has been limited in its 
ability to understand real-world social-interactive processes in autism. We 
attempted to address these limitations by scanning neurotypical and autistic 
youth (n = 86) during a text-based reciprocal social interaction that mimics a 
""live"" chat and elicits social reward processes. We focused on task-evoked 
functional connectivity (FC) of regions responsible for motivational-reward and 
mentalizing processes within the broader social reward circuitry. We found that 
task-evoked FC between these regions was significantly modulated by social 
interaction and receipt of social-interactive reward. Compared to neurotypical 
peers, autistic youth showed significantly greater task-evoked connectivity of 
core regions in the mentalizing network (e.g., posterior superior temporal 
sulcus) and the amygdala, a key node in the reward network. Furthermore, across 
groups, the connectivity strength between these mentalizing and reward regions 
was negatively correlated with self-reported social motivation and social reward 
during the scanner task. Our results highlight an important role of FC within 
the broader social reward circuitry for social-interactive reward. Specifically, 
greater context-dependent FC (i.e., differences between social engagement and 
non-social engagement) may indicate an increased ""neural effort"" during social 
reward and relate to differences in social motivation within autistic and

of toxicity testing to populations, we quantified the magnitude of genetic 
variation within 20 Daphnia magna clones derived from one lake using whole 
genome sequencing and phenotypic assays. We repeated these assays across two

single-copy orthologs conserved across a wide range of taxa. However, the 
runtime of BUSCO can be long, particularly for some large genome assemblies. It 
is a challenge for researchers to quickly iterate the genome assemblies or 
analyze a large number of assemblies.
RESULTS: Here, we present miniBUSCO, an efficient tool for assessing the 
completeness of genome assemblies. miniBUSCO utilizes the protein-to-genome 
aligner miniprot and the datasets of conserved orthologous genes from BUSCO. Our 
evaluation of the real human assembly indicates that miniBUSCO achieves a 
14-fold speedup over BUSCO. Furthermore, miniBUSCO reports a more accurate

metabolomics since the interpretation of the data in a biological context

observable features in untargeted metabolomics data, even after rigorous data 
cleaning approaches to remove degenerate features are applied. Hence, new 
strategies are required to annotate the metabolome more deeply and accurately. 
The human fecal metabolome, which is the focus of substantial biomedical 
interest, is a more complex, more variable, yet lesser-investigated sample 
matrix compared to widely studied sample types like human plasma. This 
manuscript describes a novel experimental strategy using multidimensional 
chromatography to facilitate compound identification in untargeted metabolomics. 
Pooled fecal metabolite extract samples were fractionated using offline

an orthogonal LC-MS/MS method, and the data were searched against commercial, 
public, and local spectral libraries. Multidimensional chromatography yielded 
more than a 3-fold improvement in identified compounds compared to the typical 
single-dimensional LC-MS/MS approach and successfully identified several rare

features identified by the new approach could be matched to features that were 
detectable but not identifiable in the original single-dimension LC-MS data.

Preprint.","Understanding the General Principles of T Cell Engagement by Multiscale 
Computational Simulations.","Su Z, Almo SC, Wu Y.","The use of bispecific antibodies as T cell engagers can bypass the normal 
TCR-MHC interaction, redirect the cytotoxic activity of T-cells, and lead to 
highly efficient tumor cell killing. However, this immunotherapy also causes 
significant on-target off-tumor toxicologic effects, especially when they were 
used to treat solid tumors. In order to avoid these adverse events, it is 
necessary to understand the fundamental mechanisms during the physical process 
of T cell engagement. We developed a multiscale computational framework to reach 
this goal. The framework combines simulations on the intercellular and 
multicellular levels. On the intercellular level, we simulated the 
spatial-temporal dynamics of three-body interactions among bispecific 
antibodies, CD3 and TAA. The derived number of intercellular bonds formed 
between CD3 and TAA were further transferred into the multicellular simulations 
as the input parameter of adhesive density between cells. Through the 
simulations under various molecular and cellular conditions, we were able to 
gain new insights of how to adopt the most appropriate strategy to maximize the 
drug efficacy and avoid the off-target effect. For instance, we discovered that 
the low antibody binding affinity resulted in the formation of large clusters at 
the cell-cell interface, which could be important to control the downstream 
signaling pathways. We also tested different molecular architectures of the 
bispecific antibody and suggested the existence of an optimal length in 
regulating the T cell engagement. Overall, the current multiscale simulations 
serve as a prove-of-concept study to help the future design of new biological 
therapeutics.
SIGNIFICANCE: T-cell engagers are a class of anti-cancer drugs that can directly 
kill tumor cells by bringing T cells next to them. However, current treatments 
using T-cell engagers can cause serious side-effects. In order to reduce these 
effects, it is necessary to understand how T cells and tumor cells interact 
together through the connection of T-cell engagers. Unfortunately, this process 
is not well studied due to the limitations in current experimental techniques. 
We developed computational models on two different scales to simulate the 
physical process of T cell engagement. Our simulation results provide new 
insights into the general properties of T cell engagers. The new simulation 
methods can therefore serve as a useful tool to design novel antibodies for 
cancer immunotherapy.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544116

coarse-grained molecular simulations.","Henderson AN, McDonnell RT, Elcock AH.","We describe a computational approach to building and simulating realistic 3D 
models of very large RNA molecules (>1000 nucleotides) at a resolution of one 
""bead"" per nucleotide. The method starts with a predicted secondary structure 
and uses several stages of energy minimization and Brownian dynamics (BD) 
simulation to build 3D models. A key step in the protocol is the temporary 
addition of a 4 th spatial dimension that allows all predicted helical elements 
to become disentangled from each other in an effectively automated way. We then 
use the resulting 3D models as input to Brownian dynamics simulations that 
include hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) that allow the diffusive properties of 
the RNA to be modelled as well as enabling its conformational dynamics to be 
simulated. To validate the dynamics part of the method, we first show that when 
applied to small RNAs with known 3D structures the BD-HI simulation models 
accurately reproduce their experimental hydrodynamic radii (Rh). We then apply 
the modelling and simulation protocol to a variety of RNAs for which 
experimental Rh values have been reported ranging in size from 85 to 3569

hydrodynamic radii that are usually in good agreement with experimental

Ampfer J, Seye S, Strome ED.","The SAM1 and SAM2 genes encode for S-AdenosylMethionine (AdoMet) synthetase 
enzymes, with AdoMet serving as the main methyl donor. We have previously shown 
that independent deletion of these genes alters chromosome stability and AdoMet 
concentrations in opposite ways in S. cerevisiae. To characterize other changes 
occurring in these mutants, we grew wildtype, sam1 Δ /sam1 Δ, and sam2 Δ /sam2 Δ

abundance can impart, even when the conditions tested were not specifically 
selected as targeting known methyl involving pathways. Our findings demonstrate 
that some cellular changes are directly related to AdoMet-dependent 
methyltransferases and AdoMet availability, some are directly linked to the

AUTHOR SUMMARY: S-AdenosylMethionine, or AdoMet, is the main methyl donor in all 
cells. Methylation reactions are used broadly and impact numerous processes and 
pathways. The SAM1 and SAM2 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are responsible 
for producing the enzymes called S-Adenosylmethionine synthetases, which make 
AdoMet from methionine and ATP. Our previous research showed that when these 
genes are deleted independently, they have opposite effects on AdoMet levels and 
chromosome stability. To advance our understanding of the wide array of changes 
going on in cells with these gene deletions we characterized our mutants 
phenotypically, growing in various different conditions to look for growth 
changes, and for their different gene expression profiles. In this study, we 
investigated how the differences in growth patterns are connected to the altered 
gene expression, and thereby were able to predict the mechanisms through which 
the loss of the SAM genes affects different pathways. Our investigations have 
uncovered novel mechanisms of sensitivity or resistance to many conditions and 
shown linkages to AdoMet availability, AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, 
methyl cycle compounds, or new connections to sam1 and sam2 gene deletions.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544294

depressed individuals demonstrated that single sessions of floatation- REST are 
safe, well-tolerated, and associated with acute anxiolysis. However, there is 
not sufficient evidence of the feasibility of floatation-REST as a repeated 
intervention.
METHODS: We randomized 75 individuals with anxiety and depression to six 
sessions of floatation-REST in different formats (pool-REST or pool-REST 
preferred) or an active comparator (chair-REST). Feasibility was assessed via 
adherence rate to the assigned intervention, tolerability via duration of REST 
utilization and overall study dropout rate, and safety via incidence of serious 
or non-serious adverse events.
RESULTS: Six-session adherence was 85% for pool-REST, 89% for pool-REST 
preferred, and 74% for chair-REST. Dropout rates did not differ significantly 
between the treatment conditions.Mean session durations were consistently above 
50 minutes, and when allowed to choose the duration and frequency, participants 
opted to float for an average of 75 minutes. There were no serious adverse 
events associated with any intervention. Positive experiences were endorsed more 
commonly than negative ones and were also rated at higher levels of intensity.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, six sessions of floatation-REST appear feasible, 
well-tolerated, and safe in anxious and depressed individuals. Floatation-REST 
induces positively-valenced experiences with few negative effects. Larger 
randomized controlled trials evaluating markers of clinical efficacy are 
warranted.

ultra high-field strengths (≥7T) is known to provide superior signal-to-noise 
and statistical power than comparable acquisitions at lower field strengths. In 
this study, we aim to provide a direct comparison of the seizure onset-zone 
(SOZ) lateralizing ability of 7T rs-fMRI and 3T rs-fMRI. Methods: We 
investigated a cohort of 70 temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. A paired 
cohort of 19 patients had 3T and 7T rs-fMRI acquisitions for direct comparison 
between the two field strengths. Forty-three patients had only 3T, and 8 
patients had only 7T rs-fMRI acquisitions. We quantified the functional 
connectivity between the hippocampus and other nodes within the default mode 
network (DMN) using seed-to-voxel connectivity, and measured how hippocampo-DMN 
connectivity could inform SOZ lateralization at 7T and 3T field strengths. 
Results: Differences between hippocampo-DMN connectivity ipsilateral and 
contralateral to the SOZ were significantly higher at 7T (p FDR =0.008) than at 
3T (p FDR =0.80) when measured in the same subjects. We found that our ability 
to lateralize the SOZ, by distinguishing subjects with left TLE from subjects 
with right TLE, was superior at 7T (AUC = 0.97) than 3T (AUC = 0.68). Our 
findings were reproduced in extended cohorts of subjects scanned at either 3T or 
7T. Our rs-fMRI findings at 7T, but not 3T, are consistent and highly correlated 
(Spearman Rho=0.65) with clinical FDG-PET lateralizing hypometabolism. 
Significance: We show superior SOZ lateralization in TLE patients when using 7T

mRNA life cycle and mediating non-coding RNA functions. Despite their 
importance, the specific roles of most RBPs remain unexplored because we do not 
know what specific RNAs most RBPs bind. Current methods, such as crosslinking 
and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq), have expanded our 
knowledge of RBP-RNA interactions but are generally limited by their ability to 
map only one RBP at a time. To address this limitation, we developed SPIDR 
(Split and Pool Identification of RBP targets), a massively multiplexed method 
to simultaneously profile global RNA binding sites of dozens to hundreds of RBPs 
in a single experiment. SPIDR employs split-pool barcoding coupled with 
antibody-bead barcoding to increase the throughput of current CLIP methods by 
two orders of magnitude. SPIDR reliably identifies precise, single-nucleotide 
RNA binding sites for diverse classes of RBPs simultaneously. Using SPIDR, we 
explored changes in RBP binding upon mTOR inhibition and identified that 4EBP1 
acts as a dynamic RBP that selectively binds to 5'-untranslated regions of 
specific translationally repressed mRNAs only upon mTOR inhibition. This 
observation provides a potential mechanism to explain the specificity of 
translational regulation controlled by mTOR signaling. SPIDR has the potential

Edwards K, Warncke K, Vidal JE.","Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) causes pneumonia that kills millions through 
acute toxicity and invasion of the lung parenchyma. During aerobic respiration, 
Spn releases hydrogen peroxide (Spn-H 2 O 2 ), as a by-product of enzymes SpxB 
and LctO, and causes cell death with signs of both apoptosis and pyroptosis by 
oxidizing unknown cell targets. Hemoproteins are molecules essential for life 
and prone to oxidation by H 2 O 2 . We recently demonstrated that during 
infection-mimicking conditions, Spn-H 2 O 2 oxidizes the hemoprotein hemoglobin 
(Hb), releasing toxic heme. In this study, we investigated details of the 
molecular mechanism(s) by which the oxidation of hemoproteins by Spn-H 2 O 2 
causes human lung cell death. Spn strains, but not H 2 O 2 -deficient SpnΔ spxB 
Δ lctO strains caused time-dependent cell cytotoxicity characterized by the 
rearrangement of the actin, the loss of the microtubule cytoskeleton and nuclear 
contraction. Disruption of the cell cytoskeleton correlated with the presence of 
invasive pneumococci and an increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species. 
In cell culture, the oxidation of Hb or cytochrome c (Cyt c ) caused DNA 
degradation and mitochondrial dysfunction from inhibition of complex I-driven 
respiration, which was cytotoxic to human alveolar cells. Oxidation of 
hemoproteins resulted in the creation of a radical, which was identified as a 
protein derived side chain tyrosyl radical by using electron paramagnetic 
resonance (EPR). Thus, we demonstrate that Spn invades lung cells, releasing H 2 
O 2 that oxidizes hemoproteins, including Cyt c , catalyzing the formation of a 
tyrosyl side chain radical on Hb and causing mitochondrial disruption, that 
ultimately leads to the collapse of the cell cytoskeleton.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544089

adaptive response to alanine starvation in mycobacteria.","Poulton NC, DeJesus MA, Munsamy-Govender V, Roberts CG, Azadian ZA, Bosch B, Lin 
KM, Li S, Rock JM.","Pathogenic mycobacteria are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. These bacteria are highly intrinsically drug resistant, making 
infections challenging to treat. The conserved whiB7 stress response is a key 
contributor to mycobacterial intrinsic drug resistance. Although we have a 
comprehensive structural and biochemical understanding of WhiB7, the complex set 
of signals that activate whiB7 expression remain less clear. It is believed that 
whiB7 expression is triggered by translational stalling in an upstream open 
reading frame (uORF) within the whiB7 5' leader, leading to antitermination and 
transcription into the downstream whiB7 ORF. To define the signals that activate 
whiB7 , we employed a genome-wide CRISPRi epistasis screen and identified a 
diverse set of 150 mycobacterial genes whose inhibition results in constitutive 
whiB7 activation. Many of these genes encode amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, 
tRNAs, and tRNA synthetases, consistent with the proposed mechanism for whiB7 
activation by translational stalling in the uORF. We show that the ability of 
the whiB7 5' regulatory region to sense amino acid starvation is determined by 
the coding sequence of the uORF. The uORF shows considerable sequence variation 
among different mycobacterial species, but it is universally and specifically 
enriched for alanine. Providing a potential rationalization for this enrichment, 
we find that while deprivation of many amino acids can activate whiB7 
expression, whiB7 specifically coordinates an adaptive response to alanine 
starvation by engaging in a feedback loop with the alanine biosynthetic enzyme, 
aspC . Our results provide a holistic understanding of the biological pathways 
that influence whiB7 activation and reveal an extended role for the whiB7 
pathway in mycobacterial physiology, beyond its canonical function in antibiotic 
resistance. These results have important implications for the design of 
combination drug treatments to avoid whiB7 activation, as well as help explain 
the conservation of this stress response across a wide range of pathogenic and 
environmental mycobacteria.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543512

Cammack AJ, Hoisington-Lopez J, Crosby M, Brent MR, Mitra RD, Dougherty JD.","Calling Cards is a platform technology to record a cumulative history of 
transient protein-DNA interactions in the genome of genetically targeted cell 
types. The record of these interactions is recovered by next generation 
sequencing. Compared to other genomic assays, whose readout provides a snapshot 
at the time of harvest, Calling Cards enables correlation of historical 
molecular states to eventual outcomes or phenotypes. To achieve this, Calling 
Cards uses the piggyBac transposase to insert self-reporting transposon (SRT) 
""Calling Cards"" into the genome, leaving permanent marks at interaction sites. 
Calling Cards can be deployed in a variety of in vitro and in vivo biological 
systems to study gene regulatory networks involved in development, aging, and 
disease. Out of the box, it assesses enhancer usage but can be adapted to 
profile specific transcription factor binding with custom transcription factor 
(TF)-piggyBac fusion proteins. The Calling Cards workflow has five main stages: 
delivery of Calling Card reagents, sample preparation, library preparation, 
sequencing, and data analysis. Here, we first present a comprehensive guide for 
experimental design, reagent selection, and optional customization of the 
platform to study additional TFs. Then, we provide an updated protocol for the 
five steps, using reagents that improve throughput and decrease costs, including 
an overview of a newly deployed computational pipeline. This protocol is 
designed for users with basic molecular biology experience to process samples

Preprint.",Information-theoretic analysis of a model of CAR-4-1BB-mediated NFκB activation.,"Tserunyan V, Finley S.","Systems biology utilizes computational approaches to examine an array of 
biological processes, such as cell signaling, metabolomics and pharmacology. 
This includes mathematical modeling of CAR T cells, a modality of cancer therapy 
by which genetically engineered immune cells recognize and combat a cancerous 
target. While successful against hematologic malignancies, CAR T cells have 
shown limited success against other cancer types. Thus, more research is needed 
to understand their mechanisms of action and leverage their full potential. In 
our work, we set out to apply information theory on a mathematical model of cell 
signaling of CAR-mediated activation following antigen encounter. First, we 
estimated channel capacity for CAR-4-1BB-mediated NFκB signal transduction. 
Next, we evaluated the pathway's ability to distinguish contrasting ""low"" and 
""high"" antigen concentration levels, depending on the amount of intrinsic noise. 
Finally, we assessed the fidelity by which NFκB activation reflects the 
encountered antigen concentration, depending on the prevalence of 
antigen-positive targets in tumor population. We found that in most scenarios, 
fold change in the nuclear concentration of NFκB carries a higher channel 
capacity for the pathway than NFκB's absolute response. Additionally, we found 
that most errors in transducing the antigen signal through the pathway skew 
towards underestimating the concentration of encountered antigen. Finally, we 
found that disabling IKKβ deactivation could increase signaling fidelity against 
targets with antigen-negative cells. Our information-theoretic analysis of 
signal transduction can provide novel perspectives on biological signaling, as 
well as enable a more informed path to cell engineering.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544433

consumption, and alcohol use disorder.","Miller AP, Gizer IR.","Sensation seeking is bidirectionally associated with levels of alcohol 
consumption in both adult and adolescent samples and shared neurobiological and 
genetic influences may in part explain this association. Links between sensation 
seeking and alcohol use disorder (AUD) may primarily manifest via increased 
alcohol consumption rather than through direct effects on increasing problems 
and consequences. Here the overlap between sensation seeking, alcohol 
consumption, and AUD was examined using multivariate modeling approaches for 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics in conjunction with 
neurobiologically-informed analyses at multiple levels of investigation. 
Meta-analytic and genomic structural equation modeling (GenomicSEM) approaches 
were used to conduct GWAS of sensation seeking, alcohol consumption, and AUD. 
Resulting summary statistics were used in downstream analyses to examine shared 
brain tissue enrichment of heritability and genome-wide evidence of overlap

phenotypes) and to identify genomic regions likely contributing to observed 
genetic overlap across traits (e.g., H-MAGMA, LAVA). Across approaches, results 
supported shared neurogenetic architecture between sensation seeking and alcohol 
consumption characterized by overlapping enrichment of genes expressed in 
midbrain and striatal tissues and variants associated with increased cortical 
surface area. Alcohol consumption and AUD evidenced overlap in relation to 
variants associated with decreased frontocortical thickness. Finally, genetic

important roles in development, evolution, and tissue regeneration/repair, and 
can arise as a programmed polyploidization event or be triggered by stress. 
Cancer cells are often polyploid. C. elegans nematodes are typically diploid, 
but stressors such as heat shock and starvation can trigger the production of 
tetraploid offspring. In this study, we utilized a recently published protocol 
to generate stable tetraploid strains of C. elegans and compared their 
physiological traits and sensitivity to two DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, 
cisplatin and doxorubicin. As prior studies have shown, tetraploid worms are 
approximately 30% longer, shorter-lived, and have a smaller brood size than 
diploids. We investigated the reproductive defect further, determining that 
tetraploid worms have a shorter overall germline length, a higher rate of germ 
cell apoptosis, more aneuploidy in oocytes and offspring, and larger oocytes and 
embryos. We also found that tetraploid worms are modestly protected from growth 
delay from the chemotherapeutics but are similarly or more sensitive to

discovery of novel genes or biological pathways regulating bone health. Mice are 
the most widely used mammalian model for skeletal biology and allow for the 
quantification of traits that can't easily be evaluated in humans, such as 
osteocyte lacunar morphology. The goal of our study was to investigate the 
effect of genetic diversity on multi-scale cortical bone traits of three long 
bones in skeletally-mature mice. We measured bone morphology, mechanical 
properties, material properties, lacunar morphology, and mineral composition of 
mouse bones from two populations of genetic diversity. Additionally, we compared 
how intra-bone relationships varied in the two populations. Our first population 
of genetic diversity included 72 females and 72 males from the eight Inbred 
Founder strains used to create the Diversity Outbred (DO) population. These 
eight strains together span almost 90% of the genetic diversity found in mice ( 
Mus musculus ). Our second population of genetic diversity included 25 
genetically unique, outbred females and 25 males from the DO population. We show 
that multi-scale cortical bone traits vary significantly with genetic 
background; heritability values range from 21% to 99% indicating genetic control 
of bone traits across length scales. We show for the first time that lacunar 
shape and number are highly heritable. Comparing the two populations of genetic 
diversity, we show each DO mouse does not resemble a single Inbred Founder but 
instead the outbred mice display hybrid phenotypes with the elimination of 
extreme values. Additionally, intra-bone relationships (e.g., ultimate force vs. 
cortical area) were mainly conserved in our two populations. Overall, this work

Preprint.","A translational rodent model of individual differences in sensitivity to the 
aversive properties of ethanol.","Przybysz KR, Ramirez LA, Pitock JR, Starr EM, Yang H, Glover EJ.","BACKGROUND: A strong relationship exists between individual sensitivity to the 
aversive properties of ethanol and risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Despite 
this, our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying subjective 
response to ethanol is relatively poor. A major contributor to this is the 
absence of preclinical models that enable exploration of this individual 
variability similar to studies performed in humans.
METHODS: Adult male and female Long-Evans rats were trained to associate a novel 
tastant (saccharin) with acute exposure to either saline or ethanol (1.5 g/kg or 
2.0 g/kg i.p.) over three conditioning days using a standard conditioned taste 
aversion (CTA) procedure. Variability in sensitivity to ethanol-induced CTA was 
phenotypically characterized using a median split across the populations 
studied.
RESULTS: When examining group averages, both male and female rats that had 
saccharin paired with either dose of ethanol exhibited reduced saccharin intake 
relative to saline controls of ethanol-induced CTA. Examination of individual 
data revealed a bimodal distribution of responses uncovering two distinct 
phenotypes present in both sexes. CTA-sensitive rats exhibited a rapid and 
progressive reduction in saccharin intake with each successive ethanol pairing. 
In contrast, saccharin intake was unchanged or maintained after an initial 
decrease from baseline levels in CTA-resistant rats. While CTA magnitude was 
similar between male and female CTA-sensitive rats, CTA-resistant females were 
more resistant to the development of ethanol-induced CTA than their male 
counterparts. Phenotypic differences were not driven by differences in baseline 
saccharin intake. CTA sensitivity correlated with behavioral signs of 
intoxication in only a subset of rats.
CONCLUSIONS: These data parallel work in humans by revealing individual 
differences in sensitivity to the aversive properties of ethanol that emerge 
immediately after initial exposure to ethanol in both sexes. This model can be 
leveraged in future studies to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that 
confer risk for AUD.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544209

functionally distinct classes (NP1-3). NP1 afferents have been implicated in 
pathological pain states, while NP2 and NP3 afferents also function as 
pruritoceptors. Our findings suggest that all 3 of these afferent types 
innervate iCRs and receive axoaxonic synapses from them, providing feedback 
inhibition of NP input. The iCRs also form axodendritic synapses, and their 
targets include cells that are themselves innervated by the NP afferents, thus 
allowing for feedforward inhibition. The iCRs are therefore ideally placed to 
control the input from non-peptidergic nociceptors and pruritoceptors to other 
dorsal horn neurons, and thus represent a potential therapeutic target for the

KT, Hawes D, Cabeen RP, Bienkowski MS.","Analyzing Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology within anatomical subregions is a 
significant challenge, often carried out by pathologists using a standardized, 
semi-quantitative approach. To augment traditional methods, a high-throughput, 
high-resolution pipeline was created to classify the distribution of AD 
pathology within hippocampal subregions. USC ADRC post-mortem tissue sections 
from 51 patients were stained with 4G8 for amyloid, Gallyas for neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) and Iba1 for microglia. Machine learning (ML) techniques were 
utilized to identify and classify amyloid pathology (dense, diffuse and APP 
(amyloid precursor protein)), NFTs, neuritic plaques and microglia. These 
classifications were overlaid within manually segmented regions (aligned with 
the Allen Human Brain Atlas) to create detailed pathology maps. Cases were 
separated into low, intermediate, or high AD stages. Further data extraction 
enabled quantification of plaque size and pathology density alongside ApoE 
genotype, sex, and cognitive status. Our findings revealed that the increase in 
pathology burden across AD stages was driven mainly by diffuse amyloid. The pre 
and para-subiculum had the highest levels of diffuse amyloid while NFTs were 
highest in the A36 region in high AD cases. Moreover, different pathology types 
had distinct trajectories across disease stages. In a subset of AD cases, 
microglia were elevated in intermediate and high compared to low AD. Microglia 
also correlated with amyloid pathology in the Dentate Gyrus. The size of dense 
plaques, which may represent microglial function, was lower in ApoE4 carriers. 
In addition, individuals with memory impairment had higher levels of both dense 
and diffuse amyloid. Taken together, our findings integrating ML classification 
approaches with anatomical segmentation maps provide new insights on the 
complexity of disease pathology in AD progression. Specifically, we identified 
diffuse amyloid pathology as being a major driver of AD in our cohort, regions 
of interest and microglial responses that might advance AD diagnosis and

(MYH7) have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, different 
mutations in MYH7 lead to variable penetrance and clinical severity, and alter 
myosin function to varying degrees, making it difficult to determine 
genotype-phenotype relationships, especially when caused by rare gene variants 
such as the G256E mutation.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effects of low penetrant MYH7 G256E 
mutation on myosin function. We hypothesize that the G256E mutation would alter 
myosin function, precipitating compensatory responses in cellular functions.
METHODS: We developed a collaborative pipeline to characterize myosin function 
at multiple scales (protein to myofibril to cell to tissue). We also used our 
previously published data on other mutations to compare the degree to which 
myosin function was altered.
RESULTS: At the protein level, the G256E mutation disrupts the transducer region 
of the S1 head and reduces the fraction of myosin in the folded-back state by 
50.9%, suggesting more myosins available for contraction. Myofibrils isolated 
from hiPSC-CMs CRISPR-edited with G256E (MYH7 WT/G256E ) generated greater 
tension, had faster tension development and slower early phase relaxation, 
suggesting altered myosin-actin crossbridge cycling kinetics. This 
hypercontractile phenotype persisted in single-cell hiPSC-CMs and engineered 
heart tissues. Single-cell transcriptomic and metabolic profiling demonstrated 
upregulation of mitochondrial genes and increased mitochondrial respiration, 
suggesting altered bioenergetics as an early feature of HCM.
CONCLUSIONS: MYH7 G256E mutation causes structural instability in the transducer 
region, leading to hypercontractility across scales, perhaps from increased 
myosin recruitment and altered crossbridge cycling. Hypercontractile function of 
the mutant myosin was accompanied by increased mitochondrial respiration, while 
cellular hypertrophy was modest in the physiological stiffness environment. We 
believe that this multi-scale platform will be useful to elucidate 
genotype-phenotype relationships underlying other genetic cardiovascular 
diseases.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544276

attracted a lot of attention because of its emerging role in cognitive and 
psychiatric disorders. Although previous histological studies have shown that 
the LC has heterogeneous connections and cellular features, no studies have yet 
assessed its functional topography in vivo, how this heterogeneity changes over 
aging and whether it is associated with cognition and mood. Here we employ a 
gradient-based approach to characterize the functional heterogeneity in the 
organization of the LC over aging using 3T resting-state fMRI in a 
population-based cohort aged from 18 to 88 years old (Cambridge Centre for 
Ageing and Neuroscience cohort, n=618). We show that the LC exhibits a 
rostro-caudal functional gradient along its longitudinal axis, which was 
replicated in an independent dataset (Human Connectome Project 7T dataset, 
n=184). Although the main rostro-caudal direction of this gradient was 
consistent across age groups, its spatial features varied with increasing age, 
emotional memory and emotion regulation. More specifically, a loss of 
rostral-like connectivity, more clustered functional topography and greater 
asymmetry between right and left LC gradients was associated with higher age and 
worse behavioral performance. Furthermore, participants with higher-than-normal 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ratings exhibited alterations in the 
gradient as well, which manifested in greater asymmetry. These results provide 
an in vivo account of how the functional topography of the LC changes over

R 2 ) was 0.11 (range from 0.03 to 0.34). We tested a range of mixing parameters 
(0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95) for the elastic net regularization, and compared 
the sex-stratified and sex-combined modeling on the X chromosome. We further 
investigated genes escaping X chromosome inactivation to determine if their 
genetic regulation patterns were distinct. Based on our findings, sex-stratified 
elastic net models with a balanced penalty (50% LASSO and 50% ridge) are the 
most optimal approach to predict the expression levels of X chromosome genes, 
regardless of X chromosome inactivation status. The predictive capacity of the 
optimal models in whole blood and brain cortex was confirmed through validation 
using DGN and MayoRNAseq temporal cortex cohort data. The R 2 the 
tissue-specific prediction models ranges from 9.94 × 10 -5 to 0.091. These

increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. ASD is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder associated with social dysfunction, repetitive 
behaviors, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. To examine the relationship 
between gestational sleep apnea and ASD-associated behaviors, we used a chronic 
intermittent hypoxia (CIH) protocol between gestational days (GD) 15-19 in 
pregnant rats to model late gestational sleep apnea. We hypothesized that late 
gestational CIH would produce sex- and age-specific social, mood, and cognitive 
impairments in offspring. Methods: Timed pregnant Long-Evans rats were exposed 
to CIH or room air normoxia from GD 15-19. Behavioral testing of offspring 
occurred during either puberty or young adulthood. To examine ASD-associated 
phenotypes, we quantified ASD-associated behaviors (social function, repetitive 
behaviors, anxiety-like behaviors, and spatial memory and learning), hippocampal 
activity (glutamatergic NMDA receptors, dopamine transporter, monoamine 
oxidase-A, EGR-1, and doublecortin), and circulating hormones in offspring. 
Results: Late gestational CIH induced sex- and age-specific differences in 
social, repetitive and memory functions in offspring. These effects were mostly 
transient and present during puberty. In female pubertal offspring, CIH impaired 
social function, increased repetitive behaviors, and increased circulating 
corticosterone levels, but did not impact memory. In contrast, CIH transiently 
induced spatial memory dysfunction in pubertal male offspring but did not impact 
social or repetitive functions. Long-term effects of gestational CIH were only 
observed in female offspring, wherein CIH induced social disengagement and 
suppression of circulating corticosterone levels in young adulthood. No effects 
of gestational CIH were observed on anxiety-like behaviors, hippocampal 
activity, circulating testosterone levels, or circulating estradiol levels, 
regardless of sex or age of offspring. Conclusions: Our results indicate that 
hypoxia-associated pregnancy complications during late gestation can increase 
the risk for ASD-associated behavioral and physiological outcomes, such as 
pubertal social dysfunction, corticosterone dysregulation, and memory 
impairments.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2507737/v1

Hughes TM, Seeman TE, Cole SW, Craft S.","INTRODUCTION: Adverse psychosocial exposure is associated with increased 
proinflammatory gene expression and reduced type-1 interferon gene expression, a 
profile known as the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA). 
Little is known about CTRA activity in the context of cognitive impairment, 
although chronic inflammatory activation has been posited as one mechanism 
contributing to late-life cognitive decline.
METHODS: We studied 171 community-dwelling older adults from the Wake Forest 
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center who answered questions via a telephone 
questionnaire battery about their perceived stress, loneliness, well-being, and 
impact of COVID-19 on their life, and who provided a self-collected dried blood 
spot sample. Of those, 148 had adequate samples for mRNA analysis, and 143 were 
included in the final analysis, which including participants adjudicated as 
having normal cognition (NC, n = 91) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 52) 
were included in the analysis. Mixed effect linear models were used to quantify 
associations between psychosocial variables and CTRA gene expression.
RESULTS: In both NC and MCI groups, eudaimonic well-being (typically associated 
with a sense of purpose) was inversely associated with CTRA gene expression 
whereas hedonic well-being (typically associated with pleasure seeking) was 
positively associated. In participants with NC, coping through social support 
was associated with lower CTRA gene expression, whereas coping by distraction 
and reframing was associated with higher CTRA gene expression. CTRA gene 
expression was not related to coping strategies for participants with MCI, or to 
either loneliness or perceived stress in either group.
DISCUSSION: Eudaimonic and hedonic well-being remain important correlates of 
molecular markers of stress, even in people with MCI. However, prodromal 
cognitive decline appears to moderate the significance of coping strategies as a 
correlate of CTRA gene expression. These results suggest that MCI can 
selectively alter biobehavioral interactions in ways that could potentially 
affect the rate of future cognitive decline and may serve as targets for future 
intervention efforts.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.31.23290618

amplifications.","Keller A, Gao LL, Witten D, Dunham MJ.","Whole-chromosome aneuploidy and large segmental amplifications can have 
devastating effects in multicellular organisms, from developmental disorders and 
miscarriage to cancer. Aneuploidy in single-celled organisms such as yeast also 
results in proliferative defects and reduced viability. Yet, paradoxically, CNVs 
are routinely observed in laboratory evolution experiments with microbes grown 
in stressful conditions. The defects associated with aneuploidy are often 
attributed to the imbalance of many differentially expressed genes on the 
affected chromosomes, with many genes each contributing incremental effects. An 
alternate hypothesis is that a small number of individual genes are large effect 
'drivers' of these fitness changes when present in an altered copy number. To 
test these two views, we have employed a collection of strains bearing large 
chromosomal amplifications that we previously assayed in nutrient-limited 
chemostat competitions. In this study, we focus on conditions known to be poorly 
tolerated by aneuploid yeast-high temperature, treatment with the Hsp90 
inhibitor radicicol, and growth in extended stationary phase. To identify 
potential genes with a large impact on fitness, we fit a piecewise constant 
model to fitness data across chromosome arms, filtering breakpoints in this 
model by magnitude to focus on regions with a large impact on fitness in each 
condition. While fitness generally decreased as the length of the amplification 
increased, we were able to identify 91 candidate regions that disproportionately 
impacted fitness when amplified. Consistent with our previous work with this 
strain collection, nearly all candidate regions were condition specific, with 
only five regions impacting fitness in multiple conditions.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544269

Preprint.","Temporally specific gene expression and chromatin remodeling programs regulate a 
conserved Pdyn enhancer.","Phillips RA, Wan E, Tuscher JJ, Reid D, Ianov L, Day JJ.","Neuronal and behavioral adaptations to novel stimuli are regulated by temporally 
dynamic waves of transcriptional activity, which shape neuronal function and 
guide enduring plasticity. Neuronal activation promotes expression of an 
immediate early gene (IEG) program comprised primarily of activity-dependent 
transcription factors, which are thought to regulate a second set of late 
response genes (LRGs). However, while the mechanisms governing IEG activation 
have been well studied, the molecular interplay between IEGs and LRGs remain 
poorly characterized. Here, we used transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility 
profiling to define activity-driven responses in rat striatal neurons. As 
expected, neuronal depolarization generated robust changes in gene expression, 
with early changes (1 h) enriched for inducible transcription factors and later 
changes (4 h) enriched for neuropeptides, synaptic proteins, and ion channels. 
Remarkably, while depolarization did not induce chromatin remodeling after 1 h, 
we found broad increases in chromatin accessibility at thousands of sites in the 
genome at 4 h after neuronal stimulation. These putative regulatory elements 
were found almost exclusively at non-coding regions of the genome, and harbored 
consensus motifs for numerous activity-dependent transcription factors such as 
AP-1. Furthermore, blocking protein synthesis prevented activity-dependent 
chromatin remodeling, suggesting that IEG proteins are required for this 
process. Targeted analysis of LRG loci identified a putative enhancer upstream 
of Pdyn , a gene encoding an opioid neuropeptide implicated in motivated 
behavior and neuropsychiatric disease states. CRISPR-based functional assays 
demonstrated that this enhancer is both necessary and sufficient for Pdyn 
transcription. This regulatory element is also conserved at the human PDYN 
locus, where its activation is sufficient to drive PDYN transcription in human 
cells. These results suggest that IEGs participate in chromatin remodeling at 
enhancers and identify a conserved enhancer that may act as a therapeutic target 
for brain disorders involving dysregulation of Pdyn .","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543489

disruptions due to SARS-CoV-2, serious injection related infections (SIRIs), 
like endocarditis, have increased significantly. Hospitalizations for SIRI 
provide a unique opportunity for persons who inject drugs (PWID) to engage in 
addiction treatment and infection prevention, yet many providers miss 
opportunities for evidence-based care due to busy inpatient services and lack of 
awareness. To improve hospital care, we developed a 5-item SIRI Checklist for 
providers as a standardized reminder to offer medication for opioid use disorder 
(MOUD), HIV and HCV screening, harm reduction counseling, and referral to 
community-based care. We also formalized an Intensive Peer Recovery Coach 
protocol to support PWID on discharge. We hypothesized that the SIRI Checklist 
and Intensive Peer Intervention would increase use of hospital-based services 
(HIV, HCV screening, MOUD) and linkage to community-based care: PrEP 
prescription, MOUD prescription, and related outpatient visit(s). Methods This 
is a feasibility study and randomized control trial of a checklist and intensive 
peer intervention for hospitalized PWID with SIRI admitted to UAB Hospital. We 
will recruit 60 PWID who will be randomized to one of 4 groups (SIRI Checklist, 
SIRI Checklist + Enhanced Peer, Enhanced Peer, and Standard of Care). Results 
will be analyzed using a 2x2 factorial design. We will use surveys to collect 
data on drug use behaviors, stigma, HIV risk, and PrEP interest and awareness. 
Our primary outcome of feasibility will include the ability to recruit 
hospitalized PWID and retain them in the study to determine post-discharge 
clinical outcomes. Additionally, we will explore clinical outcomes using a 
combination of patient surveys and electronic medical record data (HIV, HCV 
testing, MOUD and PrEP prescriptions). This study is approved by UAB IRB 
#300009134. Discussion This feasibility study is a necessary step in designing 
and testing patient-centered interventions to improve public health for rural 
and Southern PWID. By testing low barrier interventions that are accessible and 
reproducible in states without access to Medicaid expansion and robust public 
health infrastructure, we aim to identify models of care that promote linkage

sources and components of PM 2.5 have been linked with lower birthweight. 
However, previous results have been mixed, likely due to heterogeneity in 
sources impacting PM 2.5 and due to measurement error from using ambient data. 
Therefore, we investigated the effect of PM 2.5 sources and their high-loading 
components on birthweight using data from 198 women in the 3 rd trimester from 
the MADRES cohort 48-hour personal PM 2.5 exposure monitoring sub-study. 
Methods: The mass contributions of six major sources of personal PM 2.5 exposure 
were estimated for 198 pregnant women in the 3 rd trimester using the EPA 
Positive Matrix Factorization v5.0 model, along with their 17 high-loading 
chemical components using optical carbon and X-ray fluorescence approaches. 
Single- and multi-pollutant linear regressions were used to evaluate the 
association between personal PM 2.5 sources and birthweight. Additionally, 
high-loading components were evaluated with birthweight individually and in 
models further adjusted for PM 2.5 mass. Results : Participants were 
predominately Hispanic (81%), with a mean (SD) gestational age of 39.1 (1.5) 
weeks and age of 28.2 (6.0) years. Mean birthweight was 3,295.8g (484.1) and 
mean PM 2.5 exposure was 21.3 (14.4) µg/m 3 . A 1 SD increase in the mass 
contribution of the fresh sea salt source was associated with a 99.2g decrease 
in birthweight (95% CI: -197.7, -0.6), while aged sea salt was associated with 
lower birthweight (β =-70.1; 95% CI: -141.7, 1.4). Magnesium sodium, and 
chlorine were associated with lower birthweight, which remained after adjusting 
for PM 2.5 mass. Conclusions: This study found evidence that major sources of 
personal PM 2.5 including fresh and aged sea salt were negatively associated 
with birthweight, with the strongest effect on birthweight from Na and Mg. The 
effect of crustal and fuel oil sources differed by infant sex with negative

cellular processes, such as cell migration, cell division, and mechanosensing. 
Actomyosin self-assembles into contractile networks and bundles that underlie 
force generation and transmission in cells. A central step is the assembly of 
the myosin II filament from myosin monomers, regulation of which has been 
extensively studied. However, myosin filaments are almost always found as 
clusters within the cell cortex. While recent studies characterized cluster 
nucleation dynamics at the cell periphery, how myosin clusters grow on stress 
fibers remains poorly characterized. Here, we utilize a U2OS osteosarcoma cell 
line with endogenously tagged myosin II to measure the myosin cluster size 
distribution in the lamella of adherent cells. We find that myosin clusters can 
grow with Rho-kinase (ROCK) activity alone in the absence of myosin motor 
activity. Time-lapse imaging reveals that myosin clusters grow via increased 
myosin association to existing clusters, which is potentiated by ROCK-dependent 
myosin filament assembly. Enabling myosin motor activity allows further myosin 
cluster growth through myosin association that is dependent on F-actin 
architecture. Using a toy model, we show that myosin self-affinity is sufficient 
to recapitulate the experimentally observed myosin cluster size distribution,

Preprint.","BK (Ca) nitrosylation is associated with cerebral microvascular dysfunction in 
female 5x-FAD mice.","Silva JF, Polk FD, Savu A, Kath AM, Gee MT, Pires PW.","Cerebral microvascular dysfunction and nitro-oxidative stress are present in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to disease progression 
and severity. Large conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + channels (BK Ca ) play an 
essential role in vasodilatory responses and maintenance of myogenic tone in 
resistance arteries. BK Ca can be modified in a pro-nitro-oxidative environment, 
resulting in decreased activity and vascular hyper-contractility, which can 
compromise cerebral blood flow regulation. We hypothesized that reductions in BK 
Ca function in cerebral arteries, as a consequence of nitro-oxidative stress, 
are associated with blunted neurovascular responses in the 5x-FAD model of AD. 
Using pressure myography, we observed that posterior communicating arteries 
(PComA) from 5 months-old female 5x-FAD mice showed higher spontaneous myogenic 
tone than wild-type (WT) littermates. Constriction to the BK Ca blocker 
iberiotoxin (30 nM) was smaller in 5x-FAD than WT, suggesting lower basal BK Ca 
activity, which was independent of alterations in intracellular Ca 2+ transients 
or BK Ca mRNA expression. These vascular changes were associated with higher 
levels of oxidative stress in female 5x-FAD and a higher level of 
S-nitrosylation in the BK Ca α-subunit. In females, pre-incubation of PComA from 
5x-FAD with the reducing agent DTT (10 µM) rescued iberiotoxin-induced 
contraction. Female 5x-FAD mice showed increased expression of iNOS mRNA, lower 
resting cortical perfusion atop the frontal cortex, and impaired neurovascular 
coupling responses. No significant differences between male 5x-FAD and WT were 
observed for all parameters above. These data suggest that the exacerbation in 
BK Ca S-nitrosylation contributes to cerebrovascular and neurovascular 
impairments in female 5x-FAD mice.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cerebral vascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized 
as a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Impaired microvascular 
regulation can lead to deficits in blood flow to the brain. An intrinsic 
property of the resistance vasculature is to constrict when pressurized 
(myogenic tone), generating a vasodilatory reserve. Detrimental 
over-constriction is prevented by vascular feedback mechanisms, including the 
opening of large-conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + channels (BK Ca ). Here, using 
a combination of molecular biology tools with ex vivo and in vivo vascular 
assessments, we show a novel mechanism associated with BK Ca dysfunction in the 
cerebral microvasculature of female 5x-FAD mice. We report increased BK Ca 
S-nitrosylation linked to reduced activity and, consequently, higher basal 
myogenic tone. These changes were associated with lower perfusion of the frontal 
cortex and impaired neurovascular reactivity, suggesting that nitro-oxidative 
stress is an important mechanism of vascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.543962

with possible ARFID and other eating disorder diagnostic and risk categories. 
Clinical characteristics of respondents with possible ARFID were also examined. 
Results 2,378 (5.0%) adult respondents screened positive for ARFID. Respondents 
with possible ARFID tended to be younger, male, and have lower household income, 
and were less likely to be White and more likely to be Hispanic/Latino than most 
other diagnostic/risk groups. They had lower weight/shape concerns and eating 
disorder behaviors than all other diagnoses but higher BMI than those with AN. 
35% reported suicidal ideation, 47% reported intentions to seek treatment for an 
eating disorder, and 2% reported currently being in treatment. The most common 
clinical feature of ARFID was lack of interest in eating (80%), followed by food 
sensory avoidance (55%) and avoidance of food due to fear of aversive 
consequences (31%). Conclusions Findings from this study indicated that ARFID 
was prevalent among adult screen respondents and more common among individuals 
who were younger, male, non-White, Hispanic, and lower income relative to those 
with other eating disorders or at risk for an eating disorder. Individuals with 
possible ARFID frequently reported suicidal ideation and were rarely in 
treatment for an eating disorder. Further research is urgently needed to improve 
advances in the assessment and treatment of ARFID and improve access to care in 
order to prevent prolonged illness duration.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-3007049/v1

Spagna D, Andorf S, Martin LJ, Biagini JM, Waggoner SN, Hershey GKK.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that often 
precedes the development of food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. The 
prevailing paradigm holds that a reduced frequency and function of natural 
killer (NK) cell contributes to AD pathogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms 
and contributions of NK cells to allergic co-morbidities remain ill-defined. 
Herein, analysis of circulating NK cells in a longitudinal early life cohort of 
children with AD revealed a progressive accumulation of NK cells with low 
expression of the activating receptor NKG2D, which was linked to more severe AD 
and sensitivity to allergens. This was most notable in children co-sensitized to 
food and aero allergens, a risk factor for development of asthma. 
Individual-level longitudinal analysis in a subset of children revealed 
co-incident reduction of NKG2D on NK cells with acquired or persistent 
sensitization, and this was associated with impaired barrier function. Low 
expression of NKG2D on NK cells was paradoxically associated with depressed 
cytolytic function but exaggerated release of the proinflammatory cytokine 
TNF-α. These observations provide important new insights into a potential 
pathophysiological mechanism of atopic march involving altered NK-cell 
functional responses and define a novel endotype of severe AD.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.23290884

biological ageing and all-cause mortality - a prospective twin study.","Kankaanpää A, Tolvanen A, Joensuu L, Waller K, Heikkinen A, Kaprio J, Ollikainen 
M, Sillanpää E.","OBJECTIVES: The association between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and a 
lower risk of mortality is susceptible to bias from multiple sources. We 
investigated the potential of biological ageing to mediate the association 
between long-term LTPA and mortality and whether the methods used to account for 
reverse causality affect the interpretation of this association.
METHODS: Study participants were twins from the older Finnish Twin Cohort ( n 
=22,750; 18-50 years at baseline). LTPA was assessed using questionnaires in 
1975, 1981 and 1990. The mortality follow-up lasted until 2020 and biological 
ageing was assessed using epigenetic clocks in a subsample ( n =1,153) with 
blood samples taken during the follow-up. Using latent profile analysis, we 
identified classes with distinct longitudinal LTPA patterns and studied 
differences in biological ageing between these classes. We employed survival 
models to examine differences in total, short-term and long-term all-cause 
mortality, and multilevel models for twin data to control for familial factors.
RESULTS: We identified four classes of long-term LTPA: sedentary, moderately 
active, active and highly active. Although biological ageing was accelerated in 
sedentary and highly active classes, after adjusting for other lifestyle-related 
factors, the associations mainly attenuated. Physically active classes had a 
maximum 7% lower risk of total mortality over the sedentary class, but this 
association was consistent only in the short term and could largely be accounted 
for by familial factors. LTPA exhibited less favourable associations when 
prevalent diseases were exclusion criteria rather than covariate.
CONCLUSION: Being active may reflect a healthy phenotype instead of causally 
reducing mortality.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.23290916

Preprint.","Daily Activity Profiles over the Lifespan of Female Medflies as Biomarkers of 
Aging and Longevity.","Chen H, Müller HG, Rodovitis VG, Papadopoulos NT, Carey JR.","The relationship between the early age activity of Mediterranean fruit flies or 
other fruit flies and their lifespan has not been much studied, in contrast to 
the connections between lifespan and diet, sexual signaling and reproduction. 
The objective of this study is to assess intraday and day-to-day activity 
profiles of female Mediterranean fruit flies and their role as biomarker of 
longevity as well as to explore the relationships between these activity 
profiles, diet and age-at-death throughout the lifespan. Three distinct patterns 
of activity variations in early age activity profiles can be distinguished. A 
low-caloric diet is associated with a delayed activity peak, while a 
high-caloric diet is linked with an earlier activity peak. We find that 
age-at-death of individual medflies is connected to their activity profiles in 
early life. An increased risk of mortality is associated with increased activity 
in early age, as well as with a higher contrast between daytime and nighttime 
activity. Conversely, medflies are more likely to have a longer lifespan when 
they are fed a medium caloric diet and when their daily activity is more evenly 
distributed across the early age span and between daytime and nighttime. The 
before-death activity profile of medflies displays two characteristic 
before-death patterns, where one pattern is characterized by slowly declining 
daily activity and the other by a sudden decline in activity that is followed by 
death.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.543948

of foods in people with smell loss.","Hunter SR, Beatty C, Dalton PH.","People who lose their sense of smell self-report consuming more salt to 
compensate for a lack of flavor and enhance eating enjoyment. However, this can 
contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase 
salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not 
been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake 
in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin 
increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods 
increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years 
old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed 
two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants 
rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities' intensities, spicy intensity, 
and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three 
levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, 
participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three 
levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also 
collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium 
intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 ± 258 mg/day), 
they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and 
moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of 
overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. 
However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, 
the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating 
enjoyment in people with smell loss.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290966

Preprint.","Perivascular spaces in Alzheimer's disease are associated with inflammatory, 
stress-related, and hypertension biomarkers.","Sibilia F, Sheikh-Bahaei N, Mack WJ, Choupan J.","Perivascular spaces (PVS) are fluid-filled spaces surrounding the brain 
vasculature. Literature suggests that PVS may play a significant role in aging 
and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cortisol, a 
stress hormone, has been implicated in the development and progression of AD. 
Hypertension, a common condition in older adults, has been found to be a risk 
factor for AD. Hypertension may contribute to PVS enlargement, impairing the 
clearance of waste products from the brain and promoting neuroinflammation. This 
study aims to understand the potential interactions between PVS, cortisol, 
hypertension, and inflammation in the context of cognitive impairment. Using MRI 
scans acquired at 1.5T, PVS were quantified in a cohort of 465 individuals with 
cognitive impairment. PVS was calculated in the basal ganglia and centrum 
semiovale using an automated segmentation approach. Levels of cortisol and 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (an indicator of hypertension) were measured 
from plasma. Inflammatory biomarkers, such as cytokines and matrix 
metalloproteinases, were analyzed using advanced laboratory techniques. Main 
effect and interaction analyses were performed to examine the associations 
between PVS severity, cortisol levels, hypertension, and inflammatory 
biomarkers. In the centrum semiovale, higher levels of inflammation reduced 
cortisol associations with PVS volume fraction. For ACE, an inverse association 
with PVS was seen only when interacting with TNFr2 (a transmembrane receptor of 
TNF). There was also a significant inverse main effect of TNFr2. In the PVS 
basal ganglia, a significant positive association was found with TRAIL (a TNF 
receptor inducing apoptosis). These findings show for the first time the 
intricate relationships between PVS structure and the levels of stress-related, 
hypertension, and inflammatory biomarkers. This research could potentially guide 
future studies regarding the underlying mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and the

affecting approximately 1% of all live births. The incidence of congenital heart 
defects is exacerbated by maternal conditions, such as diabetes during the first 
trimester. Our ability to mechanistically understand these disorders is severely 
limited by the lack of human models and the inaccessibility to human tissue at 
relevant stages. Here, we used an advanced human heart organoid model that 
recapitulates complex aspects of heart development during the first trimester to 
model the effects of pregestational diabetes in the human embryonic heart. We 
observed that heart organoids in diabetic conditions develop pathophysiological 
hallmarks like those previously reported in mouse and human studies, including 
ROS-mediated stress and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, among others. Single cell

enabled quantitative protein abundance datasets from single human MNs (Cong et

nanoPOTS (Zhu et al., 2018c) single-cell mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics 
to query changes in protein expression in single MNs from postmortem ALS and 
control donor spinal cord tissues, leading to the identification of 2515 
proteins across MNs samples (>900 per single MN) and quantitative comparison of 
1870 proteins between disease groups. Furthermore, we studied the impact of

but may be prevented with risk stratification and targeted intervention. 
Preoperative protein signatures may identify patients at increased risk for 
worse postoperative outcomes, including delirium. In this study, we aimed to 
identify plasma protein biomarkers and develop a predictive model for 
postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, while also 
uncovering possible pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: SOMAscan analysis of 
1,305 proteins in the plasma from 57 older adults undergoing cardiac surgery 
requiring cardiopulmonary bypass was conducted to define delirium-specific 
protein signatures at baseline (PREOP) and postoperative day 2 (POD2). Selected 
proteins were validated in 115 patients using the ELLA multiplex immunoassay 
platform. Proteins were combined with clinical and demographic variables to 
build multivariable models that estimate the risk of postoperative delirium and 
bring light to the underlying pathophysiology. Results: A total of 666 proteins 
from SOMAscan analysis were found altered between PREOP and POD2 
(Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-p<0.01). Using these results and findings from other 
studies, 12 biomarker candidates (Tukey's fold change (|tFC|)>1.4) were selected 
for ELLA multiplex validation. Eight proteins were significantly altered at 
PREOP, and seven proteins at POD2 (p<0.05), in patients who developed 
postoperative delirium compared to non-delirious patients. Statistical analyses 
of model fit resulted in selecting a combination of age, sex, and different 
3-protein biomarker panels highly correlated with delirium at PREOP 
(angiopoietin-2, ANGPT2; C-C motif chemokine 5, CCL5; and metalloproteinase 
inhibitor 1, TIMP1; AUC=0.829) and POD2 (lipocalin-2, LCN2; neurofilament light 
chain, NFL; and CCL5; AUC=0.845). The delirium-associated proteins identified as 
biomarker candidates are involved with inflammation, glial dysfunction, 
vascularization, and hemostasis, highlighting the multifactorial pathophysiology 
of delirium. Conclusion: Our study proposes two models of postoperative delirium 
that include a combination of older age, female sex, and altered levels of 
proteins both preoperatively and postoperatively. Our results support the 
identification of patients at higher risk of developing postoperative delirium 
after cardiac surgery and provide insights on the underlying pathophysiology.

at higher risk; and the second model informs on postoperative proteomic

inter-individual variation in drug response, with some patients not responding 
to the recommended dosage of drug whereas others experience catastrophic side 
effects. For example, variants within the major hepatic Human organic cation 
transporter OCT1 (SLC22A1) can change endogenous organic cations and many 
prescription drug levels. To understand how variants mechanistically impact drug 
uptake, we systematically study how all known and possible single missense and 
single amino acid deletion variants impact expression and substrate uptake of 
OCT1. We find that human variants primarily disrupt function via folding rather 
than substrate uptake. Our study revealed that the major determinants of folding 
reside in the first 300 amino acids, including the first 6 transmembrane domains 
and the extracellular domain (ECD) with a stabilizing and highly conserved

mechanisms for how specific human variants alter transport phenotypes. We 
identify differences in frequencies of reduced function alleles across

inflammation that contributes to morbidity and mortality, especially in 
children. Patients have been found to have increased expression of cytokines and 
transmigration of leukocytes during and after CPB. Previous work has 
demonstrated that the supraphysiologic shear stresses present during CPB are 
sufficient to induce proinflammatory behavior in non-adherent monocytes. The 
interactions between shear stimulated monocytes and vascular endothelial cells 
have not been well studied and have important translational implications.
METHODS: To test the hypothesis that non-physiological shear stress experienced 
by monocytes during CPB affects the integrity and function of the endothelial 
monolayer via IL-8 signaling pathway, we have used an in vitro CPB model to 
study the interaction between THP-1 monocyte-like cells and human neonatal 
dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HNDMVECs). THP-1 cells were sheared in 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing at 2.1 Pa, twice of physiological shear stress, 
for 2 hours. Interactions between THP-1 cells and HNDMVECs were characterized 
after coculture.
RESULTS: We found that sheared THP-1 cells adhered to and transmigrated through 
the HNDMVEC monolayer more readily than static controls. When co-culturing, 
sheared THP-1 cells also disrupted in the VE-cadherin and led to reorganization 
of cytoskeletal F-actin of HNDMVECs. Treating HNDMVECs with IL-8 resulted in 
upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular 
adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) while also increasing the adherence of non-sheared 
THP-1 cells. Preincubating HNDMVECs with Reparixin, an inhibitor of CXCR2/IL-8 
receptor inhibited sheared THP-1 cell adhesion to the HNDMVECs.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that IL-8 not only increases the 
endothelium permeability during monocyte migration, but also affects the initial 
adhesion of monocytes in a CPB setup. This study revealed a novel mechanism of 
post-CPB inflammation and will contribute to the development of targeted 
therapeutics to prevent and repair the damage to neonatal patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Shear stress in a CPB-like environment promoted the adhesion and 
transmigration of monocytes to and through endothelial monolayer.Treating 
endothelial monolayer with sheared monocytes led to disruption of VE-cadherin 
and reorganization of F-actin.Interaction between sheared monocytes resulted in 
a significant increase of IL-8 release.Inhibiting IL-8 receptor prevented 
sheared monocyte adhesion, while IL-8 promoted naive monocyte adhesion.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543811

randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of four adherence 
support strategies on a composite clinical outcome in adults with MDR-TB and HIV 
initiating bedaquiline-containing MDR-TB treatment regimens and receiving ART in 
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Trial arms include 1) enhanced standard of care; 2) 
psychosocial support; 3) mHealth using cellular-enabled electronic dose

will be titrated using a differentiated service delivery (DSD)-informed 
assessment of treatment support needs. The composite primary outcome will be 
include survival, negative TB culture, retention in care and undetectable HIV 
viral load at month 12. Secondary outcomes will include individual components of 
the primary outcome and quantitative evaluation of adherence on TB and HIV 
treatment outcomes. Discussion This trial will evaluate the contribution of 
different modes of adherence support on MDR-TB and HIV outcomes with WHO 
recommended all-oral MDR-TB regimens and ART in a high-burden operational

in prostate cancer: Clinical implications as a potential therapeutic target.","Ferrari M, Wang L, Hoeppner L, Hahm E, Yu J, Kuzel T, Mansini A.","Relapsed prostate cancer (CaP), usually treated with androgen deprivation 
therapy, acquires resistance to develop into lethal metastatic 
castration-resistant CaP. The cause of resistance remains elusive, and the lack 
of biomarkers predictive of castration-resistance emergence is a stumbling block 
in managing the disease. We provide strong evidence that Myeloid differentiation 
factor-2 (MD2) plays a critical role in metastasis and CaP progression. Analysis 
of tumor genomic data and IHC of tumors showed a high frequency of MD2 
amplification and association with poor overall survival in patients. The 
Decipher-genomic test validated the potential of MD2 in predicting metastasis. 
In vitro studies demonstrated that MD2 confers invasiveness by activating MAPK 
and NF-kB signaling pathways. Furthermore, we show that metastatic cells release 
MD2 (sMD2). We measured serum-sMD2 in patients and found that the level is 
correlated to disease extent. We determined the significance of MD2 as a 
therapeutic target and found that targeting MD2 significantly inhibited 
metastasis in a murine model. We conclude that MD2 predicts metastatic behavior 
and serum-MD2 is a non-invasive biomarker for tumor burden, whereas MD2 presence 
on prostate biopsy predicts adverse disease outcome. We suggest MD2-targeted 
therapies could be developed as potential treatments for aggressive metastatic 
disease.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2968406/v1

Preprint.",Lineage motifs: developmental modules for control of cell type proportions.,"Tran M, Askary A, Elowitz MB.","In multicellular organisms, cell types must be produced and maintained in 
appropriate proportions. One way this is achieved is through committed 
progenitor cells that produce specific sets of descendant cell types. However, 
cell fate commitment is probabilistic in most contexts, making it difficult to 
infer progenitor states and understand how they establish overall cell type 
proportions. Here, we introduce Lineage Motif Analysis (LMA), a method that 
recursively identifies statistically overrepresented patterns of cell fates on 
lineage trees as potential signatures of committed progenitor states. Applying 
LMA to published datasets reveals spatial and temporal organization of cell fate 
commitment in zebrafish and rat retina and early mouse embryo development. 
Comparative analysis of vertebrate species suggests that lineage motifs 
facilitate adaptive evolutionary variation of retinal cell type proportions. LMA 
thus provides insight into complex developmental processes by decomposing them

expression of the stress response inhibitor crhbp in the zebrafish hypothalamus.","Figueroa P, Cheng J, Wang G, Kartchner C, Brito de Andrade D, Watters H, 
Crispell E, Dorsky RI.","The vertebrate hypothalamus regulates physiological and behavioral responses to 
environmental stimuli through the function of evolutionarily-conserved neuronal 
subpopulations. Our previous work found that mutation of zebrafish lef1 , which 
encodes a transcriptional mediator of the Wnt signaling pathway, leads to the 
loss of hypothalamic neurons and behavioral phenotypes that are both associated 
with stress-related human mood disorders However, the specific Lef1 target genes 
that link neurogenesis to behavior remain unknown. One candidate is otpb , which 
encodes a transcription factor with known roles in hypothalamic development. 
Here we show that otpb expression in the posterior hypothalamus is 
Lef1-dependent, and that like lef1 , its function is required for the generation 
of crhbp + neurons in this region. Transgenic reporter analysis of a crhbp 
conserved noncoding element suggests that otpb participates in a transcriptional 
regulatory network with other Lef1 targets. Finally, consistent with a role for 
crhbp in inhibiting the stress response, zebrafish otpb mutants exhibit 
decreased exploration in a novel tank diving assay. Together our findings 
suggest a potential evolutionarily-conserved mechanism for the regulation of

Preprint.","A SMART method for efficiently isolating monoclonal antibodies from individual 
rhesus macaque memory B cells.","Weinfurter JT, Bennett SN, Reynolds M.","Characterizing antigen-specific B cells is a critical component of vaccine and 
infectious disease studies in rhesus macaques (RMs). However, it is challenging 
to capture immunoglobulin variable (IgV) genes from individual RM B cells using 
5' multiplex (MTPX) primers in nested PCR reactions. In particular, the 
diversity within RM IgV gene leader sequences necessitates the use of large 5' 
MTPX primer sets to amplify IgV genes, decreasing PCR efficiency. To address 
this problem, we developed a switching mechanism at the 5' ends of the RNA 
transcript (SMART)-based method for amplifying IgV genes from single RM B cells, 
providing unbiased capture of Ig heavy and light chain pairs for cloning 
antibodies. We demonstrate this technique by isolating simian immunodeficiency 
virus (SIV) envelope-specific antibodies from single-sorted RM memory B cells. 
This approach has several advantages over existing methods for PCR cloning 
antibodies from RMs. First, optimized PCR conditions and SMART 5' and 3' rapid 
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions generate full-length cDNAs from 
individual B cells. Second, it appends synthetic primer binding sites to the 5' 
and 3' ends of cDNA during synthesis, allowing for PCR amplification of 
low-abundance antibody templates. Third, universal 5' primers are employed to 
amplify the IgV genes from cDNA, simplifying the primer mixes in the nested PCR 
reactions and improving the recovery of matched heavy and light chain pairs. We 
anticipate this method will enhance the isolation of antibodies from individual 
RM B cells, supporting the genetic and functional characterization of 
antigen-specific B cells.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543510

Preprint.","Necessary Role of Acute Ceramide Formation in The Human Microvascular 
Endothelium During Health and Disease.","SenthilKumar G, Katunaric B, Zirgibel Z, Lindemer B, Jaramillo-Torres MJ, 
Bordas-Murphy H, Schulz ME, Pearson PJ, Freed JK.","BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma ceramides independently predict adverse cardiac 
events and we have previously shown that exposure to exogenous ceramide induces 
microvascular endothelial dysfunction in arterioles from otherwise healthy 
adults (0-1 risk factors for heart disease). However, evidence also suggests 
that activation of the shear-sensitive, ceramide forming enzyme neutral 
sphingomyelinase (NSmase) enhances vasoprotective nitric oxide (NO) production. 
Here we explore a novel hypothesis that acute ceramide formation through NSmase 
is necessary for maintaining NO signaling within the human microvascular 
endothelium. We further define the mechanism through which ceramide exerts 
beneficial effects and discern key mechanistic differences between arterioles 
from otherwise healthy adults and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: Human arterioles were dissected from otherwise discarded surgical 
adipose tissue (n=123), and vascular reactivity to flow and C2-ceramide was 
assessed. Shear-induced NO production was measured in arterioles using 
fluorescence microscopy. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) fluorescence was assessed 
in isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
RESULTS: Inhibition of NSmase in arterioles from otherwise healthy adults 
induced a switch from NO to H 2 O 2 -mediated flow-induced dilation within 30 
minutes. In endothelial cells, NSmase inhibition acutely increased H 2 O 2 
production. Endothelial dysfunction in both models was prevented by treatment 
with C2-ceramide, S1P, and an agonist of S1P-receptor 1 (S1PR1), while the 
inhibition of S1P/S1PR1 signaling axis induced endothelial dysfunction. Ceramide 
increased NO production in arterioles from healthy adults, an effect that was 
diminished with inhibition of S1P/S1PR1/S1PR3 signaling. In arterioles from 
patients with CAD, inhibition of NSmase impaired dilation to flow. This effect 
was not restored with exogenous S1P. Although, inhibition of S1P/S1PR3 signaling 
impaired normal dilation to flow. Acute ceramide administration to arterioles 
from patients with CAD also promoted H 2 O 2 as opposed to NO production, an 
effect dependent on S1PR3 signaling.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that despite key differences in downstream 
signaling between health and disease, acute NSmase-mediated ceramide formation 
and its subsequent conversion to S1P is necessary for proper functioning of the 
human microvascular endothelium. As such, therapeutic strategies that aim to 
significantly lower ceramide formation may prove detrimental to the 
microvasculature.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543341

between these epigenetic mechanisms. Through genome-wide DNA methylation 
analysis and pyro-sequencing, we detected the hypermethylation of mir-219a-2 in 
renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) or renal 
ischemia/reperfusion, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in 
mir-219a-5p expression. Functionally, overexpression of mir-219a-2 enhanced 
fibronectin induction during hypoxia or TGF-β1 treatment of cultured renal 
cells. In mice, inhibition of mir-219a-5p suppressed fibronectin accumulation in 
UUO kidneys. ALDH1L2 was identified to be the direct target gene of mir-219a-5p 
in renal fibrosis. Mir-219a-5p suppressed ALDH1L2 expression in cultured renal 
cells, while inhibition of mir-219a-5p prevented the decrease of ALDH1L2 in UUO 
kidneys. Knockdown of ALDH1L2 enhanced PAI-1 induction during TGF-β1 treatment 
of renal cells, which was associated with fibronectin expression. In conclusion, 
the hypermethylation of mir-219a-2 in response to fibrotic stress attenuates 
mir-219a-5p expression and induces the up-regulation of its target gene ALDH1L2,

Aspergillus fumigatus is a key step in development of this problematic clinical 
phenotype. We and others have previously described a C2H2-containing 
transcription factor called FfmA that is required for normal levels of 
voriconazole susceptibility and expression of an ATP-binding cassette 
transporter gene called abcG1 . Null alleles of ffmA exhibit a strongly 
compromised growth rate even in the absence of any external stress. Here we 
employ an acutely repressible doxycycline-off form of ffmA to rapidly deplete 
FfmA protein from the cell. Using this approach, we carried out RNA-seq analyses 
to probe the transcriptome of A. fumigatus cells that have been deprived of 
normal FfmA levels. We found that 2000 genes were differentially expressed upon 
depletion of FfmA, consistent with the wide-ranging effect of this factor on 
gene regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput DNA 
sequencing analysis (ChIP-seq) identified 530 genes that were bound by FfmA 
using two different antibodies for immunoprecipitation. More than 300 of these 
genes were also bound by AtrR demonstrating the striking regulatory overlap with 
FfmA. However, while AtrR is clearly an upstream activation protein with clear 
sequence specificity, our data suggest that FfmA is a chromatin-associated 
factor that may bind to DNA in a manner dependent on other factors. We provide 
evidence that AtrR and FfmA interact in the cell and can influence one another's 
expression. This interaction of AtrR and FfmA is required for normal azole

Preprint.",Homologous chromosome recognition via nonspecific interactions.,"Marshall WF, Fung JC.","In many organisms, most notably Drosophila , homologous chromosomes in somatic 
cells associate with each other, a phenomenon known as somatic homolog pairing. 
Unlike in meiosis, where homology is read out at the level of DNA sequence 
complementarity, somatic homolog pairing takes place without double strand 
breaks or strand invasion, thus requiring some other mechanism for homologs to 
recognize each other. Several studies have suggested a ""specific button"" model, 
in which a series of distinct regions in the genome, known as buttons, can 
associate with each other, presumably mediated by different proteins that bind 
to these different regions. Here we consider an alternative model, which we term 
the ""button barcode"" model, in which there is only one type of recognition site 
or adhesion button, present in many copies in the genome, each of which can 
associate with any of the others with equal affinity. An important component of 
this model is that the buttons are non-uniformly distributed, such that 
alignment of a chromosome with its correct homolog, compared with a non-homolog, 
is energetically favored; since to achieve nonhomologous alignment, chromosomes 
would be required to mechanically deform in order to bring their buttons into 
mutual register. We investigated several types of barcodes and examined their 
effect on pairing fidelity. We found that high fidelity homolog recognition can 
be achieved by arranging chromosome pairing buttons according to an actual 
industrial barcode used for warehouse sorting. By simulating randomly generated 
non-uniform button distributions, many highly effective button barcodes can be 
easily found, some of which achieve virtually perfect pairing fidelity. This 
model is consistent with existing literature on the effect of translocations of 
different sizes on homolog pairing. We conclude that a button barcode model can 
attain highly specific homolog recognition, comparable to that seen in actual 
cells undergoing somatic homolog pairing, without the need for specific 
interactions. This model may have implications for how meiotic pairing is 
achieved.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544427

scan that simultaneously acquires multiple diffusion preparations and echo 
times. We processed the data to produce quantitative T2* and diffusivity maps

pain. While most research on chronic pain has focused on mechanisms maintaining 
pain, there is a critical unmet need to understand what prevents pain from 
re-emerging in those who recover from acute pain. We found that interleukin 
(IL)-10, a pain resolving cytokine, is persistently produced by resident 
macrophages in the spinal meninges during remission from pain. IL-10 upregulated 
expression and analgesic activity of δ-opioid receptor (δOR) in the dorsal root 
ganglion. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of IL-10 signaling or δOR 
triggered relapse to pain in both sexes. These data challenge the widespread 
assumption that remission of pain is simply a return to the naïve state before 
pain was induced. Instead, our findings strongly suggest a novel concept that: 
remission is a state of lasting pain vulnerability that results from a 
long-lasting neuroimmune interactions in the nociceptive system.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544200

Preprint.","Allelic chromatin structure primes imprinted expression of Kcnk9 during 
neurogenesis.","Loftus D, Bae B, Whilden CM, Whipple AJ.","Differences in chromatin state inherited from the parental gametes influence the 
regulation of maternal and paternal alleles in offspring. This phenomenon, known 
as genomic imprinting, results in genes preferentially transcribed from one 
parental allele. While local epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation are 
known to be important for the establishment of imprinted gene expression, less 
is known about the mechanisms by which differentially methylated regions (DMRs) 
lead to differences in allelic expression across broad stretches of chromatin. 
Allele-specific higher-order chromatin structure has been observed at multiple 
imprinted loci, consistent with the observation of allelic binding of the 
chromatin-organizing factor CTCF at multiple DMRs. However, whether allelic 
chromatin structure impacts allelic gene expression is not known for most 
imprinted loci. Here we characterize the mechanisms underlying brain-specific 
imprinted expression of the Peg13-Kcnk9 locus, an imprinted region associated 
with intellectual disability. We performed region capture Hi-C on mouse brain 
from reciprocal hybrid crosses and found imprinted higher-order chromatin 
structure caused by the allelic binding of CTCF to the Peg13 DMR. Using an in 
vitro neuron differentiation system, we show that on the maternal allele 
enhancer-promoter contacts formed early in development prime the brain-specific 
potassium leak channel Kcnk9 for maternal expression prior to neurogenesis. In 
contrast, these enhancer-promoter contacts are blocked by CTCF on the paternal 
allele, preventing paternal Kcnk9 activation. This work provides a 
high-resolution map of imprinted chromatin structure and demonstrates that 
chromatin state established in early development can promote imprinted 
expression upon differentiation.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.544389

glioblastoma (GBM) malignancy and treatment responses. The composition, 
heterogeneity, and localization of extracellular core matrix proteins (CMPs) 
that mediate such interactions, however, are not well understood. Here, we 
characterize functional and clinical relevance of genes encoding CMPs in GBM at 
bulk, single cell, and spatial anatomical resolution. We identify a ""matrix 
code"" for genes encoding CMPs whose expression levels categorize GBM tumors into 
matrisome-high and matrisome-low groups that correlate with worse and better 
survival, respectively, of patients. The matrisome enrichment is associated with 
specific driver oncogenic alterations, mesenchymal state, infiltration of 
pro-tumor immune cells and immune checkpoint gene expression. Anatomical and 
single cell transcriptome analyses indicate that matrisome gene expression is 
enriched in vascular and leading edge/infiltrative anatomic structures that are 
known to harbor glioma stem cells driving GBM progression. Finally, we 
identified a 17-gene matrisome signature that retains and further refines the 
prognostic value of genes encoding CMPs and, importantly, potentially predicts 
responses to PD1 blockade in clinical trials for GBM. The matrisome gene

Alzheimer's disease (AD). Impaired microglial phagocytosis is one of the main 
proposed outcomes by which these AD-risk genes may contribute to 
neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms translating genetic association to 
cellular dysfunction remain unknown. Here we show that microglia form lipid 
droplets (LDs) upon exposure to amyloid-beta (Aβ), and that their LD load 
increases with proximity to amyloid plaques in brains from human patients and 
the AD mouse model 5xFAD. LD formation is dependent upon age and disease 
progression and is more prominent in the hippocampus in mice and humans. Despite 
variability in LD load between microglia from male versus female animals and 
between cells from different brain regions, LD-laden microglia exhibited a 
deficit in Aβ phagocytosis. Unbiased lipidomic analysis identified a substantial 
decrease in free fatty acids (FFAs) and a parallel increase in triacylglycerols 
(TAGs) as the key metabolic transition underlying LD formation. We demonstrate 
that DGAT2, a key enzyme for the conversion of FFAs to TAGs, promotes microglial 
LD formation, is increased in microglia from 5xFAD and human AD brains, and that 
inhibiting DGAT2 improved microglial uptake of Aβ. These findings identify a new 
lipid-mediated mechanism underlying microglial dysfunction that could become a 
novel therapeutic target for AD.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.04.543525

F, Henen MA, Kieft JS, Glasgow A, Steckelberg AL.","An important pathogenicity factor of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses is 
Nsp1, which suppresses host gene expression and stunts antiviral signaling. 
SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds the ribosome to inhibit translation through mRNA 
displacement and induces degradation of host mRNAs through an unknown mechanism. 
Here we show that Nsp1-dependent host shutoff is conserved in diverse 
coronaviruses, but only Nsp1 from β-CoV inhibits translation through ribosome 
binding. The C-terminal domain of all β-CoV Nsp1s confers high-affinity 
ribosome-binding despite low sequence conservation. Modeling of interactions of 
four Nsp1s to the ribosome identified few absolutely conserved amino acids that, 
together with an overall conservation in surface charge, form the β-CoV Nsp1 
ribosome-binding domain. Contrary to previous models, the Nsp1 ribosome-binding 
domain is an inefficient translation inhibitor. Instead, the Nsp1-CTD likely 
functions by recruiting Nsp1's N-terminal ""effector"" domain. Finally, we show 
that a viral cis -acting RNA element has co-evolved to fine-tune SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 
function, but does not provide similar protection against Nsp1 from related 
viruses. Together, our work provides new insight into the diversity and 
conservation of ribosome-dependent host-shutoff functions of Nsp1, knowledge 
that could aide future efforts in pharmacological targeting of Nsp1 from 
SARS-CoV-2, but also related human-pathogenic β-coronaviruses. Our study also 
exemplifies how comparing highly divergent Nsp1 variants can help to dissect the 
different modalities of this multi-functional viral protein.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.544141

tendon healing and restore function. Patient rehabilitation progression are 
typically studied in controlled, lab settings and do not represent the long-term 
loading experienced during daily living. The purpose of this study is to develop 
a wearable paradigm to accurately monitor Achilles tendon loading and walking 
speed using low-cost sensors that reduce subject burden. Ten healthy adults 
walked in an immobilizing boot under various heel wedge conditions (30°, 5°, 0°) 
and walking speeds. Three-dimensional motion capture, ground reaction force, and 
6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals were collected per trial. We used 
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to predict 
peak Achilles tendon load and walking speed. The effects of using only 
accelerometer data, different sampling frequency, and multiple sensors to train 
the model were also explored. Walking speed models outperformed (mean absolute 
percentage error (MAPE): 8.41 ± 4.08%) tendon load models (MAPE: 33.93 ± 23.9%). 
Models trained with subject-specific data performed significantly better than 
generalized models. For example, our personalized model that was trained with 
only subject-specific data predicted tendon load with a 11.5 ± 4.41% MAPE and 
walking speed with a 4.50 ± 0.91% MAPE. Removing gyroscope channels, decreasing 
sampling frequency, and using combinations of sensors had inconsequential 
effects on models performance (changes in MAPE < 6.09%). We developed a simple 
monitoring paradigm that uses LASSO regression and wearable sensors to 
accurately predict Achilles tendon loading and walking speed while ambulating in 
an immobilizing boot. This paradigm provides a clinically implementable strategy 
to longitudinally monitor patient loading and activity while recovering from

complex phenomena. To improve the understanding and ultimately find more 
effective treatments, researchers leverage computer simulations mimicking the 
tumor growth in silico. The challenge here is to account for the many phenomena 
influencing the disease progression and treatment protocols. This work 
introduces a computational model to simulate vascular tumor growth and the 
response to drug treatments in 3D. It consists of two agent-based models for the 
tumor cells and the vasculature. Moreover, partial differential equations govern 
the diffusive dynamics of the nutrients, the vascular endothelial growth factor, 
and two cancer drugs. The model focuses explicitly on breast cancer cells 
over-expressing HER2 receptors and a treatment combining standard chemotherapy 
(Doxorubicin) and monoclonal antibodies with anti-angiogenic properties 
(Trastuzumab). However, large parts of the model generalize to other scenarios. 
We show that the model qualitatively captures the effects of the combination 
therapy by comparing our simulation results with previously published 
pre-clinical data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of the model and 
the associated C++ code by simulating a vascular tumor occupying a volume of

function. However most fluorescence experiments are only qualitative inasmuch as 
the absolute number of fluorescent particles can often not be determined. 
Additionally, conventional approaches to measuring fluorescence intensity cannot 
distinguish between two or more fluorophores that are excited and emit in the 
same spectral window, as only the total intensity in a spectral window can be 
obtained. Here we show that, by using photon number resolving experiments, we 
are able to determine the number of emitters and their probability of emission 
for a number of different species, all with the same measured spectral 
signature. We illustrate our ideas by showing the determination of the number of 
emitters per species and the probability of photon collection from that species, 
for one, two, and three otherwise unresolvable fluorophores. The convolution 
Binomial model is presented to model the counted photons emitted by multiple 
species. And then the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to match 
the measured photon counts to the expected convolution Binomial distribution 
function. In applying the EM algorithm, to leverage the problem of being trapped 
in a sub-optimal solution, the moment method is introduced in finding the

(MPI) SPECT images acquired at lower radiation dose and/or acquisition time such 
that the processed images improve observer performance on the clinical task of 
detecting perfusion defects. To address this need, we build upon concepts from 
model-observer theory and our understanding of the human visual system to 
propose a Detection task-specific deep-learning-based approach for denoising MPI 
SPECT images (DEMIST). The approach, while performing denoising, is designed to 
preserve features that influence observer performance on detection tasks. We 
objectively evaluated DEMIST on the task of detecting perfusion defects using a 
retrospective study with anonymized clinical data in patients who underwent MPI 
studies across two scanners (N = 338). The evaluation was performed at low-dose 
levels of 6.25%, 12.5% and 25% and using an anthropomorphic channelized 
Hotelling observer. Performance was quantified using area under the receiver 
operating characteristics curve (AUC). Images denoised with DEMIST yielded 
significantly higher AUC compared to corresponding low-dose images and images 
denoised with a commonly used task-agnostic DL-based denoising method. Similar 
results were observed with stratified analysis based on patient sex and defect 
type. Additionally, DEMIST improved visual fidelity of the low-dose images as 
quantified using root mean squared error and structural similarity index metric. 
A mathematical analysis revealed that DEMIST preserved features that assist in 
detection tasks while improving the noise properties, resulting in improved 
observer performance. The results provide strong evidence for further clinical 
evaluation of DEMIST to denoise low-count images in MPI SPECT.","PMCID: PMC10274935

identify the right scale for coarse-graining, or equivalently, the right number 
of degrees of freedom. For confluent biological tissues, both vertex and Voronoi 
models, which differ only in their representation of the degrees of freedom, 
have effectively been used to predict behavior, including fluid-solid 
transitions and cell tissue compartmentalization, which are important for 
biological function. However, recent work in 2D has hinted that there may be 
differences between the two models in systems with heterotypic interfaces 
between two tissue types, and there is a burgeoning interest in 3D tissue 
models. Therefore, we compare the geometric structure and dynamic sorting 
behavior in mixtures of two cell types in both 3D vertex and Voronoi models. We 
find that while the cell shape indices exhibit similar trends in both models, 
the registration between cell centers and cell orientation at the boundary are 
significantly different between the two models. We demonstrate that these 
macroscopic differences are caused by changes to the cusp-like restoring forces 
introduced by the different representations of the degrees of freedom at the 
boundary, and that the Voronoi model is more strongly constrained by forces that 
are an artifact of the way the degrees of freedom are represented. This suggests 
that vertex models may be more appropriate for 3D simulations of tissues with

software and hardware infrastructure, the platform provides open-source data 
standardization, management, visualization, and processing and simplifies the 
data pipeline. brainlife.io automatically tracks the provenance history of 
thousands of data objects, supporting simplicity, efficiency, and transparency 
in neuroscience research. Here brainlife.io's technology and data services are 
described and evaluated for validity, reliability, reproducibility, 
replicability, and scientific utility. Using data from 4 modalities and 3,200 
participants, we demonstrate that brainlife.io's services produce outputs that 
adhere to best practices in modern neuroscience research.","PMCID: PMC10274934

12. ArXiv. 2023 Jun 8:arXiv:2306.05255v1. Preprint.,"Toward more accurate and generalizable brain deformation estimators for 
traumatic brain injury detection with unsupervised domain adaptation.","Zhan X, Sun J, Liu Y, Cecchi NJ, Flao EL, Gevaert O, Zeineh MM, Camarillo DB.","Machine learning head models (MLHMs) are developed to estimate brain deformation 
for early detection of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the overfitting to 
simulated impacts and the lack of generalizability caused by distributional 
shift of different head impact datasets hinders the broad clinical applications 
of current MLHMs. We propose brain deformation estimators that integrates 
unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to predict whole-brain 
maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With 12,780 simulated head 
impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on on-field head impacts 
from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts 
using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. 
The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method 
significantly outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction 
accuracy (p<0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and 0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) 
and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football 
impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model significantly outperformed the 
baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation accuracy 
(p<0.001). The DRCA domain adaptation reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to 
be well below TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to 
detect TBI in future clinical applications.","PMCID: PMC10274939

spectroscopy.","Ogunlade B, Tadesse LF, Li H, Vu N, Banaei N, Barczak AK, Saleh AAE, Prakash M, 
Dionne JA.","Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's deadliest infectious disease, with 1.5 million 
annual deaths and half a million annual infections. Rapid TB diagnosis and 
antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) are critical to improve patient 
treatment and to reduce the rise of new drug resistance. Here, we develop a 
rapid, label-free approach to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains 
and antibiotic-resistant mutants. We collect over 20,000 single-cell Raman 
spectra from isogenic mycobacterial strains each resistant to one of the four 
mainstay anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, moxifloxacin and amikacin) and 
train a machine-learning model on these spectra. On dried TB samples, we achieve 
> 98% classification accuracy of the antibiotic resistance profile, without the 
need for antibiotic co-incubation; in dried patient sputum, we achieve average 
classification accuracies of ~ 79%. We also develop a low-cost, portable Raman 
microscope suitable for field-deployment of this method in TB-endemic regions.","PMCID: PMC10274949

double graph.","Cheng H, Asri M, Lucas J, Koren S, Li H.","Despite recent advances in the length and the accuracy of long-read data, 
building haplotype-resolved genome assemblies from telomere to telomere still 
requires considerable computational resources. In this study, we present an 
efficient de novo assembly algorithm that combines multiple sequencing 
technologies to scale up population-wide telomere-to-telomere assemblies. By 
utilizing twenty-two human and two plant genomes, we demonstrate that our 
algorithm is around an order of magnitude cheaper than existing methods, while 
producing better diploid and haploid assemblies. Notably, our algorithm is the 
only feasible solution to the haplotype-resolved assembly of polyploid genomes.","PMCID: PMC10274930

Fiol GD, Hochheiser H, Haas B, Schloss PD, Eddy JA, Albrecht J, Fedorov A, 
Waldron L, Hoffman AM, Bradshaw RL, Leek JT, Wright C.","Software is vital for the advancement of biology and medicine. Analysis of usage 
and impact metrics can help developers determine user and community engagement, 
justify additional funding, encourage additional use, identify unanticipated use 
cases, and help define improvement areas. However, there are challenges 
associated with these analyses including distorted or misleading metrics, as 
well as ethical and security concerns. More attention to the nuances involved in 
capturing impact across the spectrum of biological software is needed. 
Furthermore, some tools may be especially beneficial to a small audience, yet 
may not have compelling typical usage metrics. We propose more general 
guidelines, as well as strategies for more specific types of software. We 
highlight outstanding issues regarding how communities measure or evaluate 
software impact. To get a deeper understanding of current practices for software 
evaluations, we performed a survey of participants in the Informatics Technology 
for Cancer Research (ITCR) program funded by the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI). We also investigated software among this community and others to assess 
how often infrastructure that supports such evaluations is implemented and how 
this impacts rates of papers describing usage of the software. We find that 
developers recognize the utility of analyzing software usage, but struggle to 
find the time or funding for such analyses. We also find that infrastructure 
such as social media presence, more in-depth documentation, the presence of 
software health metrics, and clear information on how to contact developers seem 
to be associated with increased usage rates. Our findings can help scientific 
software developers make the most out of evaluations of their software.","PMCID: PMC10274942

lanadelumab and subcutaneous C1-inhibitor concentrate.","Riedl MA, Hinds DR, Prince PM, Alvord TM, Dosenovic S, Abdelhadi JF, Brownrigg 
JR, Camp CL, Machnig T, Banerji A.","BACKGROUND: New hereditary angioedema (HAE) treatments have become available in 
recent years for the treatment of HAE due to C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency, 
including two subcutaneous (SC) options: a monoclonal antibody (lanadelumab) and 
a plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate (SC-C1-INH). Limited real-world data on 
these therapies have been reported.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe new users of lanadelumab and SC-C1-INH, 
including demographics, healthcareresource utilization (HCRU), costs, and 
treatment patterns before and after beginning treatment.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that used an administrative 
claims data base. Two mutually exclusive cohorts of adult (ages 18 years) new 
users of lanadelumab or SC-C1-INH with 180 days of continuous use were 
identified. HCRU, costs, and treatment patterns were assessed in the 180-day 
period before the index date (new treatment use) and up to 365 days after the 
index date. HCRU and costs were calculated as annualized rates.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients who used lanadelumab and 38 patients who used 
SC-C1-INH were identified. The most frequentlyused on-demand HAE treatments at 
baseline were the same for both cohorts: bradykinin B2 antagonists (48.9% of the 
patients on lanadelumab, 52.6% of the patients on SC-C1-INH) and C1-INHs (40.4% 
of the patients on lanadelumab, 57.9% of the patients on SC-C1-INH). More than 
33% of the patients continued to fill on-demand medications after treatment 
initiation. Annualized angioedema-associated emergency department visits and 
hospitalizations decreased after initiation of treatment, from 1.8 to 0.6 for 
the patients on lanadelumab and from 1.3 to 0.5 for the patients on SC-C1-INH. 
Annualized total healthcare costs after treatment initiation in the database 
were $866,639 and $734,460 for the lanadelumab and SC-C1-INH cohorts, 
respectively. Pharmacy costs accounted for >95% of these total costs.
CONCLUSION: Although HCRU decreased after the initiation of treatment, 
angioedema-associated emergency department visits and hospitalizations and 
on-demand treatment fills were not completely eliminated. This indicates ongoing 
disease andtreatment burden despite use of modern HAE medicines.","DOI: 10.2500/aap.2023.44.230026
