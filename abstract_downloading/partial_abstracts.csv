growth factors associated with the major hemopoietic lineages. In contrast, the 
regulatory factors associated with the commitment and differentiation of 
precursor cells in the early events of lymphogenesis are much less clearly 
understood. In this review, Christopher Henney describes the isolation and 
characterization of one such factor-IL-7-and its effect on early B- and T-cell 
development.","DOI: 10.1016/0167-5699(89)90175-8
