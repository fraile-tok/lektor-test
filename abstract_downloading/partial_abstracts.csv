Preprint.","Molecular basis for potent B cell responses to antigen displayed on particles of 
viral size.","Brooks JF, Riggs J, Mueller JL, Mathenge R, Wholey WY, Yoda ST, Vykunta VS, 
Cheng W, Zikherman J.","Although it has long been appreciated that multivalent antigens - and 
particularly viral epitope display - produce extremely rapid, robust, and 
T-independent humoral immune responses, the biochemical basis for such potency 
has been incompletely understood. Here we take advantage of a set of neutral 
liposomes of viral size that are engineered to display affinity mutants of the 
model antigen (Ag) hen egg lysozyme at precisely varied density. We show that 
particulate Ag display by liposomes induces highly potent B cell responses that 
are dose-and density-dependent but affinity-independent. Titrating dose of 
particulate, but not soluble, Ag reveals bimodal Erk phosphorylation and 
cytosolic calcium increases. Particulate Ag induces signal amplification 
downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR) by selectively evading LYN-dependent 
inhibitory pathways, but in vitro potency is independent of CD19. Importantly, 
Ag display on viral-sized particles signals independently of MYD88 and IRAK1/4, 
but activates NF- κ B robustly in a manner that mimics T cell help. Together, 
such biased signaling by particulate Ag promotes MYC expression and reduces the 
threshold required for B cell proliferation relative to soluble Ag. These 
findings uncover a molecular basis for highly sensitive B cell response to viral 
Ag display and remarkable potency of virus-like particle vaccines that is not 
merely accounted for by avidity and BCR cross-linking, and is independent of the 
contribution of B cell nucleic acid-sensing machinery.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.15.528761

Preprint.",A Non-Canonical IRAK Signaling Pathway Triggered by DNA Damage.,"Li Y, Shah RB, Sarti S, Belcher AL, Lee BJ, Gorbatenko A, Nemati F, Yu I, 
Stanley Z, Shao Z, Silva JM, Zha S, Sidi S.","Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinases (IRAKs) are core effectors of 
Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R signaling, with no reported roles outside of 
innate immunity. We find that vertebrate cells exposed to ionizing radiation 
(IR) sequentially activate IRAK4 and IRAK1 through a phosphorylation cascade 
mirroring that induced by TLR/IL-1R, resulting in a potent anti-apoptotic 
response. However, IR-induced IRAK1 activation does not require the receptors or 
the IRAK4/1 adaptor protein MyD88, and instead of remaining in the cytoplasm, 
the activated kinase is immediately transported to the nucleus via a conserved 
nuclear localization signal. We identify: double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) as the 
biologic trigger for this pathway; the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino1 as the 
scaffold enabling IRAK4/1 activation in place of TLR/IL-1R-MyD88; and the 
pro-apoptotic PIDDosome (PIDD1-RAIDD-caspase-2) as a critical downstream target 
in the nucleus. The data delineate a non-canonical IRAK signaling pathway 
derived from, or ancestral to, TLR signaling. This DSB detection pathway, which 
is also activated by genotoxic chemotherapies, provides multiple actionable 
targets for overcoming tumor resistance to mainstay cancer treatments.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.08.527716

toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B pathway in a rat model of adjuvant 
arthritis.","Wang Y, Liu J, Huang C, Sun Y, Zhang W, Wan L, Zong R, Wang Y.","OBJECTIVE: To observe the impact of Xinfeng capsule (XFC) on cardiovascular 
function in adjuvant arthritis (AA) model rats and investigate the mechanism 
though toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling 
pathway.
METHODS: Seventy rats were randomly divided into seven groups: normal control 
(NC), model control (MC), tripterygium glycosides tablet (TPT), methotrexate 
(MTX), high, moderate and low dose XFC group. The administration began from day 
19 after modeling for 30 day. Paw swelling, arthritic index (AI), cardiac 
function indexes and myocardial pathological pattern were detected. The 
expression of TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor (MyD) 88, interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated 
factor (TRAF) 6, NF-κB, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) proteins in 
myocardial tissue were determined by western blot method.
RESULTS: Paw swelling and AI in MC group increased in MC group (P < 0.01), and 
decreased in high and moderate dose XFC groups (P < 0.01 or P > 0.05). Left 
ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 
(LVEDP), heart rate (HR) were elevated in MC group (P < 0.01), and ± dp/dtmax 
and CI were reduced (P < .01); while LVSP, LVEDP and HR declined and ±dp/ dtmax, 
CI improved in high dose XFC group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). LVSP in high dose XFC 
group were reduced more than other treatment groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The 
improvements on LVEDP, dp/ dt-max were superior to MTX and low dose XFC group, 
and the improvement on CI was better than low dose XFC group (P < 0.05 or P < 
0.01). Myocardial fibers arranged irregular in MC group with intracellular edema 
and mitochondria damage. The modifications on myocardial structural were shown 
in each treatment group, but more prominent in TPT, high and moderate dose XFC 
group. The proteins of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, NF-κB, TNF-α were highly 
expressed in MC group, and those proteins declined in high and moderate dose XFC 
group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). High dose XFC group was superior to MTX and low 
dose XFC group on reducing TLR4, NF-κB, TNF-α (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: XFC can not only inhibit the excessive activation of TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling pathway and the increased inflammatory mediators, but also reduce the 
damage of myocardial tissue and cells.","DOI: 10.1016/s0254-6272(17)30035-3

quantified the three reported miR-146a targets: two inflammation related targets 
Traf6, IRAK1; and the only reported target in chondrocytes Smad4. We confirmed 
the regulative function of miR-146a between hypoxia and these genes, and

infection-induced chronic inflammation. Large numbers of innate immune cells are 
present in HCCs and can influence disease outcome. Here, we demonstrated that 
the tumor suppressor serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (STK4) differentially 
regulates TLR3/4/9-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages and thereby is 
protective against chronic inflammation-associated HCC. STK4 dampened 
TLR4/9-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion but enhanced TLR3/4-triggered 
IFN-β production via binding to and phosphorylating IL-1 receptor-associated 
kinase 1 (IRAK1), leading to IRAK1 degradation. Notably, macrophage-specific 
Stk4 deletion resulted in chronic inflammation, liver fibrosis, and HCC in mice 
treated with a combination of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and CCl4, along with 
either LPS or E. coli infection. STK4 expression was markedly reduced in 
macrophages isolated from human HCC patients and was inversely associated with 
the levels of IRAK1, IL-6, and phospho-p65 or phospho-STAT3. Moreover, serum 
STK4 levels were specifically decreased in HCC patients with high levels of 
IL-6. In STK4-deficient mice, treatment with an IRAK1/4 inhibitor after DEN 
administration reduced serum IL-6 levels and liver tumor numbers to levels 
similar to those observed in the control mice. Together, our results suggest 
that STK4 has potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for 
inflammation-induced HCC.","DOI: 10.1172/JCI81203

12e was identified as the most potent inhibitor of this class (EC50 = 1.1 
μmol/l) with minimal cytotoxicity (CC50 = 61.8 μmol/l). In order to gain insight 
into its detailed antiviral mechanism of action, we performed PCR array analyses

pro-inflammatory as well as antiviral cytokine genes including CXCL-8, IL-1α, 
TNF-α, IL-3, IRAK-1, and DDX58. Their induction by 12e was verified by 
individual RT-PCR analyses. In addition, 12e was found to stimulate secretion of 
soluble factors with anti-HCV replication activity. Among the 12e-induced 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, CXCL-8 showed a strong positive correlation between 
its transcriptional activation and antiviral potency. Interestingly, a

progression of T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we determined that 
compared with thymic and peripheral T cells, T-ALL cells from patients have 
elevated levels of IRAK1 and IRAK4 mRNA as well as increased total and 
phosphorylated protein. Targeted inhibition of IRAK1 and IRAK4, either with 
shRNA or with a pharmacological IRAK1/4 inhibitor, dramatically impeded 
proliferation of T-ALL cells isolated from patients and T-ALL cells in a murine 
leukemia model; however, IRAK1/4 inhibition had little effect on cell death. We 
screened several hundred FDA-approved compounds and identified a set of drugs 
that had enhanced cytotoxic activity when combined with IRAK inhibition. 
Administration of an IRAK1/4 inhibitor or IRAK knockdown in combination with 
either ABT-737 or vincristine markedly reduced leukemia burden in mice and 
prolonged survival. IRAK1/4 signaling activated the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, 
increasing K63-linked ubiquitination and enhancing stability of the

re-directing IRAK-4 activity to TAK1 independent NF-κB activation and by 
inhibition of IRAK-1/IRAK-2 activity. IRAK-M is expressed in 
monocytes/macrophages and lung epithelial cells. Lack of IRAK-M in mice greatly 
improves the resistance to nosocomial pneumonia and lung tumors, which entices 
IRAK-M as a potential therapeutic target. IRAK-M consists of an N-terminal death 
domain (DD), a dysfunctional kinase domain and unstructured C-terminal domain. 
Little is known however on IRAK-M's structure-function relationships.

IRAK-2 and IRAK-4 molecules, we generated a 3D structure model of the human

in the endogenous capacity of IRAK-M to activate NF-κB that is displayed upon 
overexpression in 293T cells. W74 and R97, at distinct interfaces of the 
IRAK-M-DD, were crucial for this endogenous NF-κB activating capacity, as well 
as the C-terminal domain (S445-E596) of IRAK-M. Resulting anti-inflammatory A20 
and pro-inflammatory IL-8 transcription in 293T cells was W74 dependent, while 
IL-8 protein expression was dependent on R97 and the TRAF6 binding motif at 
P478. The IRAK-M-DD W74 and R97 binding interfaces are predicted to interact 
with opposite sides of IRAK-4-DD's. Secondly we identified DD residues important 
for the inhibitory action of IRAK-M by stable overexpression of mutants in THP-1 
macrophages and H292 lung epithelial cells. IRAK-M inhibited TLR2/4-mediated 
cytokine production in macrophages in a manner that is largely dependent on W74. 
R97 was not involved in inhibition of TNF production but was engaged in IL-6 
down-regulation by IRAK-M. Protein-interactive residues D19-A23, located in 
between W74 and R97, were also observed to be crucial for inhibition of TLR2/4 
mediated cytokine induction in macrophages. Remarkably, IRAK-M inhibited TLR5 
mediated IL-8 production by lung epithelial cells independent of W74 and R97, 
but dependent on D19-A23 and R70, two surface-exposed regions that harbor 
predicted IRAK-2-DD interaction points of IRAK-M.
CONCLUSION: IRAK-M employs alternate residues of its DD to inhibit the different 
inflammatory mediators induced by varying TLRs and cells.","DOI: 10.1186/s12964-014-0077-3

arthritis.","Ben Mkaddem S, Hayem G, Jönsson F, Rossato E, Boedec E, Boussetta T, El Benna J, 
Launay P, Goujon JM, Benhamou M, Bruhns P, Monteiro RC.","Rheumatoid arthritis-associated (RA-associated) inflammation is mediated through 
the interaction between RA IgG immune complexes and IgG Fc receptors on immune 
cells. Polymorphisms within the gene encoding the human IgG Fc receptor IIA 
(hFcγRIIA) are associated with an increased risk of developing RA. Within the 
hFcγRIIA intracytoplasmic domain, there are 2 conserved tyrosine residues 
arranged in a noncanonical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif 
(ITAM). Here, we reveal that inhibitory engagement of the hFcγRIIA ITAM either 
with anti-hFcγRII F(ab')2 fragments or intravenous hIgG (IVIg) ameliorates 
RA-associated inflammation, and this effect was characteristic of previously 
described inhibitory ITAM (ITAMi) signaling for hFcαRI and hFcγRIIIA, but only 
involves a single tyrosine. In hFcγRIIA-expressing mice, arthritis induction was 
inhibited following hFcγRIIA engagement. Moreover, hFcγRIIA ITAMi-signaling 
reduced ROS and inflammatory cytokine production through inhibition of guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor VAV-1 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1), 
respectively. ITAMi signaling was mediated by tyrosine 304 (Y304) within the 
hFcγRIIA ITAM, which was required for recruitment of tyrosine kinase SYK and 
tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Anti-hFcγRII F(ab')2 treatment of inflammatory 
synovial cells from RA patients inhibited ROS production through induction of 
ITAMi signaling. These data suggest that shifting constitutive hFcγRIIA-mediated 
activation to ITAMi signaling could ameliorate RA-associated inflammation.","DOI: 10.1172/JCI74572

diabetic rat aorta.","Emadi SS, Soufi FG, Khamaneh AM, Alipour MR.","OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to evaluate whether microRNA-146a, as 
an NF-кB regulating factor and its adapter proteins (TRAF6 and IRAK1), are 
affected by diabetes in rat aorta.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control and diabetic groups 
(n=6 in each). Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (55 
mg/kg; i.p.) in 12 h fasted rats. The gene expression of microRNA-146a, NF-κB, 
IRAK1, and TRAF6 were determined by real time PCR.
RESULTS: The expression of microRNA-146a was down-regulated in diabetic aorta 
when compared with the control group (p<0.05). The mRNA expression levels of 
NF-кB, TRAF6 and IRAK1 also increased in the diabetic rat aorta when compared 
with their control counterparts (p<0.01 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that down-regulation of microRNA-146a may lead 
to derangement in NF-кB negative feedback loop, propelling the aorta toward 
inflammation.","DOI: 10.4149/endo_2014_02_103
