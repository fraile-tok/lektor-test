Introduction
CD8+ T cells play an essential role in the host immune response to viruses by recognizing and eliminating infected cells (Zhang and Bevan, 2011). Recognition is mediated by the αβ T cell receptor (TCR), which binds viral peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on infected cells. After detection, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells undergo clonal expansion and acquire effector functions to clear infected cells. The effectiveness of the T cell response to a given virus relies on highly diverse αβ TCR repertoires able to recognize multiple viral epitopes and assure protection from viral escape. This diversity is generated at three levels: somatic recombination of variable (V), diversity (D, β chain only), and joining (J) gene segments to form TCR α and β chains, random nucleotide insertion or deletion at the V(D)J junctions, and combinatorial pairing of α and β chains.
Although theoretical estimates of TCR clonal diversity may reach 1015 (Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2004), the actual size of the CD8+ TCRβ repertoire in human adults is in the range of 105–108 (Li et al., 2016, Qi et al., 2014, Robins et al., 2010). This number is dwarfed by the potential number of antigenic peptides that could be encountered, suggesting that TCRs must be highly cross-reactive to achieve effective immunity. Several studies of TCR cross-reactivity have used combinatorial peptide libraries to estimate how many peptides a TCR can recognize (Adams et al., 2016, Hemmer et al., 1997, Ishizuka et al., 2009, Wooldridge et al., 2012). These studies have demonstrated that a single TCR can recognize more than one million peptides in the context of a single MHC molecule. This remarkable promiscuity explains how the naive TCR repertoire provides broad immunity to vast peptide arrays and also highlights the potential of TCR cross-reactivity to elicit autoimmune disease (Wooldridge et al., 2012). In this study, we asked how many TCRs from human T cell pools can recognize a single peptide-bound MHC (pMHC) ligand. Our analysis provides the most complete information to date on the size and diversity of CD8+ TCR repertoires elicited by specific viral epitopes.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza A virus (IAV) cause chronic and acute infections in humans, respectively. The CD8+ T cell response to CMV and IAV has been studied extensively (Griffiths et al., 2015, La Gruta and Turner, 2014). The matrix protein pp65 accounts for 70%–90% of the CD8+ T cell response to CMV (Wills et al., 1996). The dominant epitope in histocompatibility/human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+ subjects corresponds to residues 495–503 of pp65 (NLVPMVATV, referred to as NLV) (Weekes et al., 1999). In IAV, the dominant epitope for CD8+ T cells in HLA-A2+ subjects corresponds to residues 58–66 of matrix protein M1 (GILGFVFTL, referred to as GIL) (Gotch et al., 1987). Characterization of the TCR repertoires elicited by these two dominant viral epitopes has revealed several important features. For NLV-specific TCRs, preferential usage of certain Vβ gene segments is observed in some individuals, but such bias does not seem to be shared by different individuals (Weekes et al., 1999), suggesting that the NLV-specific TCR repertoire is large and functionally redundant (Day et al., 2007, Koning et al., 2014, Neller et al., 2015, Nguyen et al., 2014, Peggs et al., 2002, Trautmann et al., 2005). In contrast, GIL-specific TCRs exhibit more restricted V gene usage, with high-percentage representations of TRAV27, TRAV12, and TRBV (Gil et al., 2015, Gotch et al., 1987, Moss et al., 1991). To date, several hundred distinct TCRβs (541 and 411 for NLV and GIL, respectively) and TCRαs (140 and 617 for NLV and GIL, respectively) have been reported. However, it remains to be determined whether these numbers adequately represent the full diversity of these antigen-specific TCR repertoires in individuals and in populations.
We applied unique molecular identifier (UMI)-labeled high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and single-cell TCR analysis to interrogate NLV- and GIL-specific CD8+ T cell repertoires and identified thousands of new NLV- and GIL-specific TCRαs and TCRβs and dozens of distinct complementary determining region (CDR)3α and CDR3β motifs. This diversity is substantially greater than previously described for T cell responses to single viral epitopes, both for private and public TCR clonotypes. We further determined the crystal structures of two GIL-specific TCRs, one expressing the dominant TRBV19 gene and the other an unrelated TRBV, in complex with GIL–HLA-A2. These structures, in conjunction with those of TCR–NLV–HLA-A2 complexes (Gras et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2015), may explain, at least in part, the greater diversity of NLV-specific versus GIL-specific TCRs. The exceptionally broad T cell repertoires revealed by our comprehensive portrait of two distinct anti-viral responses ensure protection against clonal loss and pathogen variation.
