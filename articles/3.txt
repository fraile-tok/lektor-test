SUMMARY
The CD8+ T cell noncytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR) was discovered during studies of asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects more than 30 years ago. In contrast to CD8+ T cell cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) activity, CNAR suppresses HIV replication without target cell killing. This activity has characteristics of innate immunity: it acts on all retroviruses and thus is neither epitope specific nor HLA restricted. The HIV-associated CNAR does not affect other virus families. It is mediated, at least in part, by a CD8+ T cell antiviral factor (CAF) that blocks HIV transcription. A variety of assays used to measure CNAR/CAF and the effects on other retrovirus infections are described. Notably, CD8+ T cell noncytotoxic antiviral responses have now been observed with other virus families but are mediated by different cytokines. Characterizing the protein structure of CAF has been challenging despite many biologic, immunologic, and molecular studies. It represents a low-abundance protein that may be identified by future next-generation sequencing approaches. Since CNAR/CAF is a natural noncytotoxic activity, it could provide promising strategies for HIV/AIDS therapy, cure, and prevention.

(I) INTRODUCTION
A major component of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are often inaccurately known only as “killer T cells” or CTLs, for cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This terminology defines only one of the effector functions of CD8+ T cells, which is their ability to recognize and kill pathogen-infected cells and cancer cells. In reality, CD8+ T cells are polyfunctional (1); their various functions include not only target cell killing (cytotoxicity) but also expansion via cell proliferation, the secretion of soluble proteins (cytokine production), and antiviral responses mediated by noncytotoxic mechanisms. The importance of the CD8+ T cell noncytotoxic immune activity is of major interest to our laboratory and the topic of this review.

The initial observation of a CD8+ T cell noncytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR) was made in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection many years ago (2). It was found in asymptomatic subjects infected by the virus. Indeed, CNAR was the first discovered immune response against HIV. This noncytotoxic CD8+ T cell anti-HIV activity does not require major histocompatibility complex (MHC) recognition or cell-to-cell contact and is not the result of blocking virus entry, reverse transcription, or integration (section VI). Since then, this noncytotoxic antiviral activity has been shown to be active against all HIV isolates and other retroviruses, and similar CD8+ T cell noncytotoxic antiviral activities have been observed with other viral infections (section VIII).

This review will provide background information on how characteristics of a noncytotoxic CD8+ T cell-mediated antiviral response, or CNAR, differ from the antiviral cytotoxicity mediated by CD8+ T cells (Table 1). The article will cover the discovery and clinical relevance of CNAR as well as the major secreted protein associated with its anti-HIV activity, CAF (the CD8+ T cell antiviral factor). Furthermore, the assays and experimental approaches used to characterize this noncytotoxic antiviral response and its mode of action will be described. Because the search for CAF has uncovered the existence of several proteins that have anti-HIV activity but are not CAF, such as the β-chemokines, we will also review several of these soluble antiviral proteins (section IX).

The noncytotoxic role of CD8+ T cells is important for the development of immune-based therapies for HIV, for understanding viral latency, and for approaches toward an HIV vaccine and a cure, as well as for an appreciation of this immune activity in other viral infections.
